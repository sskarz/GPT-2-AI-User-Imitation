Happy 4th of July!! 🎉💥


[7/4/2023 7:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh hey, I hope you are doing well. Happy 4th of July to you too.🎆


[7/4/2023 7:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea like 2 days ago we had our first 4th of july in South El Monte, and it was pretty good.


[7/4/2023 7:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Did you watch it?


[7/4/2023 7:10 PM] sskarz
oh no I didn’t get to see it


[7/4/2023 7:10 PM] sskarz
I passed out that day 😵‍💫


[7/4/2023 7:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol it happens, and you are in college, I can't blame you.


[7/4/2023 7:10 PM] prabipyakurel
How is everything else going?


[7/4/2023 7:11 PM] sskarz
It’s going pretty well! Started teaching another class and it’s been pretty smooth so that’s where all my attention has gone to for the summer. How about you?

👍 

[7/4/2023 7:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Wow , you are a brilliant person so I am sure you are the best teacher out there. I am doing alright, it has been a mixture of stress and happiness as sometimes I feel like everything is going to be okay while other times I just think about all the things that can go wrong. But overall, yea it has been kind of weird.


[7/4/2023 7:21 PM] sskarz
Brilliant is more you haha, but I appreciate the compliment. I’m guessing you’re stressed from the move to Berkeley?


[7/4/2023 7:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Aw, thank you. Oh my god, yes this is the first time I will be away from home, like 7 hours type of away and when I think about it it makes me really sad. I am going to miss like everyone. We have just been buying stuff to take over there and figuring out how I am going to manage over there alone.


[7/4/2023 7:29 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah it can be scary to be out so far away for a while. To be honest I haven’t experienced that myself so I can’t speak so much. But hey it’s going to be a fun experience! If you ever need help with preparing mindset and actual stuff to move, no one knows better than my sister so try contacting her if you ever feel a little lost. Knowing you though, I know you’ll be more than fine! 💯


[7/4/2023 7:32 PM] sskarz
You got any plans to celebrate for today?


[7/4/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
person IYea hopefully I will feel at ease after a few months there, but I will probably be back every once in a while. Your sister is the most beautiful and helpful personI have ever met, like she is amazing. She is very cute too.


[7/4/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I don't have any plans today, probably going to watch a movie later and then go to bed, that is if the fireworks stop and I can actually get some sleep. 😂


[7/4/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?

[7/4/2023 8:17 PM] sskarz
Yeahhhh tho I’m not as excited to go back, I saw the professors I got for this semester and they’re mostly terrible 😞

[7/4/2023 8:52 PM] sskarz

Gonna be a while then


[7/4/2023 9:30 PM] prabipyakurel
How is your dog?


[7/4/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
we gave him some calm down pills (i don't know the specific name), and we put him in my sisters room with really loud music


[7/4/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
so we can drown out the sound of the fireworks


[7/4/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
he gets so scared and starts shuddering but he seems fine right now


[7/4/2023 9:54 PM] prabipyakurel
ohhh yea i hope he is okay, seems like a strong dog.


[7/4/2023 9:54 PM] sskarz
oh no he's a little furball that can't take more than a small spark haha


[7/4/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel
furball?


[7/4/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/4/2023 9:55 PM] sskarz

[7/4/2023 9:55 PM] sskarz

[7/4/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 10:20 AM] prabipyakurel
I am just wondering.


[7/5/2023 10:20 AM] sskarz
nope


[7/5/2023 10:21 AM] sskarz
why do you ask?


[7/5/2023 10:21 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh, on mutual friends it shows that person too, so i was just curious.


[7/5/2023 10:21 AM] sskarz
uh let me search them up, maybe i have history but i don't remember this person


[7/5/2023 10:22 AM] sskarz
apparently i did invite this person to some server back in 2020, but to be honest i can't remember who this is


[7/5/2023 10:23 AM] sskarz
they are also mutual friends with a professor I know in Mark Keppel, so my guess is maybe I shared a class with this person?


[7/5/2023 10:23 AM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh i see, yea he is a keppel student


[7/5/2023 10:23 AM] sskarz
Yeah that would make sense


[7/5/2023 10:24 AM] prabipyakurel
but yea thanks I was just looking around and saw that in common so I asked


[7/5/2023 10:24 AM] sskarz
Oh yeah no worries


[7/5/2023 10:24 AM] sskarz
How'd you sleep last night btw?


[7/5/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
Um, after most of the big ones were done, the person down my street started again, so it was another hour after that. I honestly don't know when I fell asleep yesterday to be honest.


[7/5/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
you?


[7/5/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
I kept waking up to the sound of **BANG** in the distance like 6 times over lol


[7/5/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
yep that too


[7/5/2023 10:26 AM] sskarz
I'm just gonna pray that they all finished their fireworks last night and no more from now on 😭


[7/5/2023 10:26 AM] prabipyakurel
omg yes, I need sleep and i didnt quite get that yesterday


[7/5/2023 10:26 AM] prabipyakurel
the sky is so foggy and smells toxic


[7/5/2023 10:27 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 10:27 AM] sskarz
I got a warning on my phone about it


[7/5/2023 10:27 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm, its crazy. Apparently around SoCal there were a lot of illegal fireworks happening.


[7/5/2023 10:28 AM] sskarz
oh yeah happens every time


[7/5/2023 10:28 AM] sskarz
people usually buy the fireworks through "gray market" means and its cheaper that way


[7/5/2023 10:28 AM] prabipyakurel
I was trying to sleep yesterday and was wondering how much these people must have spent on fireworks.


[7/5/2023 10:28 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm yea


[7/5/2023 10:28 AM] sskarz
if you try and get it legally its crazy crazy expensive


[7/5/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
like 50 dollars for a sizeable boom


[7/5/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel
wow


[7/5/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel
yea it was pretty fun yesterday until we were tired and wanted to sleep


[7/5/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel
and we usually have our windows open because of the heat, and yesterday I was like "um no" and closed those too.


[7/5/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
oh no your room was probably heating like an oven


[7/5/2023 10:31 AM] prabipyakurel
It was so hot around the house plus the smoke and noise outside


[7/5/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz

rollercoasters, bungee jumping and all things dangerous sound fun


[7/5/2023 10:34 AM] sskarz
finally, someone sees this perspective like I do haha


[7/5/2023 10:34 AM] prabipyakurel
no, the last time i remembered I was still kind of short and no one else in my family likes high rides, so...


[7/5/2023 10:34 AM] prabipyakurel
yes, do you like rollercoasters?


[7/5/2023 10:34 AM] sskarz

i was talking with my parents about roller coasters and on the news was this one story about roller coaster malfunction and I got lectured on how unsafe it is.

[7/5/2023 10:41 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 10:41 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 10:59 AM] sskarz
oh my mom loves pakistani dramas, though I haven't watched any of those


[7/5/2023 11:01 AM] prabipyakurel
I see, yea they are not as dramatic as indian serials, but they are like kind of slow and fun to binge watch when doing something else.


[7/5/2023 11:01 AM] sskarz
ahhh I get that


[7/5/2023 11:01 AM] sskarz
I don't watch dramas much usually, but if I do then korean dramas are like my go to


[7/5/2023 11:01 AM] sskarz
I don't know what it is about theirs but its just entertaining but I can't really put my finger on it


[7/5/2023 11:02 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh interesting, I don't watch them in episodes but sometimes I will search of k-drama funny scenes and watching it without understanding a singe word.

[7/5/2023 11:07 AM] sskarz
"something out there" that's a MOOD


[7/5/2023 11:07 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:08 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:09 AM] sskarz
ah so general ed stuff is mainly done!


[7/5/2023 11:09 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:12 AM] sskarz
I just love the fact that I get to choose my own schedule and I'm not in a box for 8 hours continuously


[7/5/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel
and then some very specific people are like, "no you are going to die"


[7/5/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel
yea I think thats cool tho, like more choices


[7/5/2023 11:13 AM] sskarz
i think it may be because if you don't have good time management skills, then its really hard


[7/5/2023 11:13 AM] sskarz
I can see it from that perspective


[7/5/2023 11:13 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm thats what I was thinking


[7/5/2023 11:13 AM] sskarz
but as long as you're on top of your assignments and study relatively well

you are right


[7/5/2023 11:18 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:18 AM] prabipyakurel
yea


[7/5/2023 11:18 AM] sskarz
and also that ship was just extremely poorly built


[7/5/2023 11:19 AM] prabipyakurel
yea they took that thing for another trip knowing there was a malfunction and a defect


[7/5/2023 11:19 AM] prabipyakurel
took the lives of like 6 people for no reason


[7/5/2023 11:19 AM] sskarz

I'm all for dangerous things trust me


[7/5/2023 11:21 AM] sskarz
but the ocean, and then sharks

[7/5/2023 11:21 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:22 AM] prabipyakurel
I also cant swim so if by any cance the cage breaks and I have to swim up by myself I might as well just stop trying


[7/5/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
ah yeah that's just certain death


[7/5/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
I think I would just die from shock


[7/5/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
if a shark was just attacking my cage

or 90% chance of death from a tall fall or 10% to survive but be paralyzed like everywhere


[7/5/2023 11:25 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:25 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:25 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:28 AM] prabipyakurel
Like the name was gender neutral and during final exam we were comparing answers and it was taking too long and he was like can i just call and we can screen share.


[7/5/2023 11:28 AM] prabipyakurel
now I still think this is a girl


[7/5/2023 11:29 AM] prabipyakurel
and then he called and then I picked up and said hi...


[7/5/2023 11:29 AM] prabipyakurel
and the deep voice was like "hi" and I was dead


[7/5/2023 11:29 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:29 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] prabipyakurel
damn cool


[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm i see


[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] sskarz
and that was most of our roster for the club


[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] prabipyakurel
OHHHHH lol


[7/5/2023 11:32 AM] sskarz
and I think that was one of the people that signed up and wanted to be in


[7/5/2023 11:33 AM] sskarz
because my chat history is referring to that


[7/5/2023 11:33 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:33 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:33 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:34 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:34 AM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 11:35 AM] sskarz
I have a friend that is a guy, but he has like a thin figure and long hair


[7/5/2023 11:35 AM] sskarz
and this one time, we were walking out of the AMC theaters from watching the new spiderman movie and so we both go to the mens restroom


[7/5/2023 11:35 AM] prabipyakurel
oh


[7/5/2023 11:35 AM] sskarz
as I was washing my hands, and my friend is walking out, these 2 kids stare at him and say, "you know this is the mens restroom right?"


[7/5/2023 11:36 AM] sskarz
and right then, I just had to pause and look at them for a second, but then I finally realized and I just started laughing


[7/5/2023 11:36 AM] sskarz
my friend didn't take any offense but it was hilarious


[7/5/2023 11:36 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 11:38 AM] sskarz
its like the feeling when you're talking to a new person and they say their name but you don't catch it then, so you have to wait till someone else says their name to figure it out


[7/5/2023 11:38 AM] sskarz
idk if that's just me tho


[7/5/2023 11:38 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 3:15 PM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 3:15 PM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 3:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 3:16 PM] sskarz
I can definitely see that


[7/5/2023 3:17 PM] prabipyakurel
i think mushrooms, olives, and eggplants are the most disgusting things on the planet.


[7/5/2023 3:17 PM] sskarz
definitely isn’t anywhere near my favorite or I would even choose it out of any other option


[7/5/2023 3:17 PM] sskarz
that’s fair tbh


[7/5/2023 3:17 PM] sskarz
olives to me just have no taste


[7/5/2023 3:18 PM] prabipyakurel
meh yea, if they are chopped up real good and put in something they dont matter to me


[7/5/2023 3:18 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 3:18 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:00 PM] sskarz
imo


[7/5/2023 5:00 PM] prabipyakurel
yea everyone likes those, but I dont like them


[7/5/2023 5:00 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:00 PM] sskarz
yeah


[7/5/2023 5:01 PM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 5:01 PM] prabipyakurel
fr


[7/5/2023 5:01 PM] sskarz
like I have a friend, she will literally prefer dried seaweed over any kind of chips


[7/5/2023 5:01 PM] prabipyakurel
omg yes there are those people who sit with just that for lunch and are like its my lunch


[7/5/2023 5:01 PM] sskarz
idk how they do it


[7/5/2023 5:02 PM] prabipyakurel
I think its because we arent used to it eating something like that for lunch all the time so


[7/5/2023 5:02 PM] sskarz
that's tru


[7/5/2023 5:03 PM] prabipyakurel
like my parents are like rice rice rice that is the only thing to fill you and not make you sick


[7/5/2023 5:03 PM] sskarz
*i mean they aren't wrong*


[7/5/2023 5:03 PM] sskarz
rice has a lot of carbs so it makes you full pretty quick


[7/5/2023 5:03 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:04 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:05 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:05 PM] prabipyakurel
its likes ignoring a loading page so it loads faster


[7/5/2023 5:05 PM] sskarz
im the kind of person where like if i order something a few days before, that's the only thing that i think of till i get that delivery


[7/5/2023 5:05 PM] sskarz
i have no idea why


[7/5/2023 5:06 PM] prabipyakurel
no its alright, if there is my money involved in something I would stress over it as well


[7/5/2023 5:07 PM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 5:09 PM] prabipyakurel
yea there was this time in physics where we had wires and batteries to make the bulb light up and i kept doing things that I wasnt supposed to and the bulb just stopped working.


[7/5/2023 5:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Thank you


[7/5/2023 5:09 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:11 PM] sskarz
yeah the whole reason I got into where I am today is because I asked my dad if I could build one when I was 12


[7/5/2023 5:11 PM] sskarz
and then like 7 years later I can finally do it since I saved up enough 👍

u at 5 years old


[7/5/2023 5:12 PM] sskarz
no no no I'm just a very curious person haha


[7/5/2023 5:12 PM] sskarz
always have been


[7/5/2023 5:12 PM] sskarz
curiosity is like the drive of my life


[7/5/2023 5:12 PM] prabipyakurel
thats awesome, you must be like ahead all your peers in college too huh


[7/5/2023 5:13 PM] prabipyakurel
like you had that background knowledge of comp sci before starting your major


[7/5/2023 5:13 PM] sskarz
only in career wise I would say but even then, there's a lot of people in my classes that are BRILLIANT


[7/5/2023 5:13 PM] sskarz
and I'm just in awe every time


[7/5/2023 5:14 PM] sskarz
that's what happens when passion turns into career I guess


[7/5/2023 5:14 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm yea its just amazing


[7/5/2023 5:15 PM] sskarz
You want to become a lawyer right?


[7/5/2023 5:15 PM] prabipyakurel
yes sir


[7/5/2023 5:15 PM] sskarz
what made you wanna become a lawyer out of curiosity?


[7/5/2023 5:16 PM] prabipyakurel
um when I was like in 5th grade or sixth grade we had to make presentations about careers and I think I chose lawyer/attoney because I knew what it was but was curious


[7/5/2023 5:17 PM] prabipyakurel
and the more I researched the more I learned and since there is research and writing involved and communications, i was like okay this is what I am good at and will love to do everyday.


[7/5/2023 5:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Also I kind of want to help people with the problems.


[7/5/2023 5:19 PM] sskarz
Your honor, my lawyer is ballin

DEBATE CLASSSSSSSSSSSS


[7/5/2023 5:20 PM] sskarz
one of my favorite classes ever


[7/5/2023 5:20 PM] prabipyakurel
omg i realized instead of acadec i should have joined speecha nd debate


[7/5/2023 5:20 PM] prabipyakurel
I made a mistake of now switching early


[7/5/2023 5:20 PM] prabipyakurel
hopefully I can take a similar class at berkeley


[7/5/2023 5:20 PM] sskarz
acadec gave you good work ethic tho I imagine


[7/5/2023 5:21 PM] sskarz
being in that club made me realize just how much more work you had to manage back in keppel 😵‍💫


[7/5/2023 5:21 PM] prabipyakurel
yea taught me how to condense large amounts of info into parts that i can understand


[7/5/2023 5:21 PM] prabipyakurel
keppel was just keppel


[7/5/2023 5:21 PM] prabipyakurel
that school made me feel dumb everytime I walked in


[7/5/2023 5:22 PM] prabipyakurel
you were in acadec too right?


[7/5/2023 5:23 PM] sskarz
yeah just for a year


[7/5/2023 5:23 PM] sskarz
it was...


[7/5/2023 5:23 PM] sskarz
I had more work from acadec than any of my 6 classes


[7/5/2023 5:23 PM] prabipyakurel
damn, thats how I felt freshmen year too


[7/5/2023 5:23 PM] prabipyakurel
like for the 1st week or so I was like "why did I do this"


[7/5/2023 5:24 PM] prabipyakurel
but the teacher was nice and got used to it


[7/5/2023 5:24 PM] prabipyakurel
but because of acadec I know 2 people at berkeley so there is that too


[7/5/2023 5:25 PM] sskarz
ayy nice!


[7/5/2023 5:25 PM] sskarz
so you got some familiar faces already


[7/5/2023 5:25 PM] sskarz
hopefully that makes the transition easier

[7/5/2023 5:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] sskarz
oh my


[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] sskarz
I salute them 🫡


[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] sskarz
I wish I had enough brainpower to do anything physics related


[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] sskarz
I took physics 1 and absolutely hated every second of it


[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] sskarz
but damn I love the concepts, just none of the math 💀


[7/5/2023 5:27 PM] prabipyakurel
yea me too, everyday

[7/5/2023 5:28 PM] prabipyakurel

math is deadly


[7/5/2023 5:28 PM] sskarz

[7/5/2023 5:28 PM] sskarz

[7/6/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
Just some thought provoking stuff


[7/6/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
Idk was fun to think about


[7/6/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
1) height, 2) confusing 3) meat 4) memory 5) lightning 6) sing 7) helping people 8) future self.


[7/6/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
lol it was very intriguing


[7/6/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
u?


[7/6/2023 8:50 PM] sskarz
1) Breathe (since they didn't say that you wouldn't feel pain from the height jump)
2) Only spicy, more range in food there
3) Fruit since there are more variety for me to choose from
4) Memory for sure (I'm already semi funny 😅 )
5) Lightning, quick and painless if anything
6) Dance, I wanna move and groove everywhere
7) 40k, making 350k makes no sense if I'm not giving a positive impact to those around me
8) Future, no regrets in the past


[7/6/2023 8:51 PM] sskarz
now my entire tiktok page is filled with this account 💀


[7/6/2023 8:52 PM] prabipyakurel

I am extremely sorry, I didn't mean to ignore you, my dad brought indian sweets and I was in the kitchen devouring them. My day was pretty chill I had a talk with my advisor in the morning and basically just followed up on emails and things throughout the day. I cleaned my room and just watched TV. Not too boring today.


[7/6/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel

What is QWERTY?


[7/6/2023 10:13 PM] sskarz
it's like a typing style


[7/6/2023 10:14 PM] prabipyakurel
No no it’s alright, I thought you just stopped responding and I was like oh shoot


[7/6/2023 10:14 PM] prabipyakurel
But it’s fine Kay


[7/6/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
some people call it "proper typing" but tbh whatever is comfortable to a person is their own typing


[7/6/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
dw I don't like leaving people on read, I find it weird personally


[7/6/2023 10:15 PM] sskarz
I usually respond within a 20 minute time unless I am doing something that takes more attention to


[7/6/2023 10:15 PM] sskarz
idk if that helps you in any way but yeah 👍


[7/6/2023 10:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea yea I understand


[7/6/2023 10:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol  it’s alright


[7/6/2023 10:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I am assuming you typing speed is higher than average


[7/6/2023 10:30 PM] sskarz
oh yeah btw I found the movie you were talking about earlier on youtube


[7/6/2023 10:31 PM] sskarz
Yeah but its slowed down over the years


[7/6/2023 10:31 PM] sskarz
they trained me in middle school for 2 years to type in QWERTY and my highest ever was 146 Words Per Minute


[7/6/2023 10:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice, you can always watch the trailer first

my sister also doesn't like any anime at all


[7/6/2023 10:44 PM] prabipyakurel
No it’s just when he started watching there were some that he used to put on and let’s just say it was not so appropriate 😬


[7/6/2023 10:44 PM] prabipyakurel
I love her


[7/6/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz

[7/6/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
I don't usually get nightmares, but if I do, then I wake up in a cold sweat and its like lucid


[7/6/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
wbu?


[7/6/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Um sometimes I like just freak out and wake up thinking someone is watching me but there is like nothing there. And other times I wake up because my body does that fake fall thing in bed. Don’t know if that has ever happened to you.


[7/6/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
oh yeah I know that feeling far too well


[7/6/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
the fake fall thingy

[7/6/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz

[7/6/2023 11:02 PM] sskarz
can you lucid dream?


[7/6/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh lucid dreams is kind of rare for me, I have experienced it like once or twice where I am like I know I am in a dream but won’t wake up.


[7/6/2023 11:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Kinda creepy


[7/6/2023 11:03 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/6/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz

[7/6/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz
wait no sleep paralysis happens when you wake up... i think


[7/6/2023 11:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Not too sure


[7/6/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Sleep paralysis is when you can’t move knowing that you are in a dream and need to wake up


[7/6/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Something like that


[7/6/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
ah


[7/6/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz

You might have an ACM at Berkeley


[7/7/2023 10:16 AM] prabipyakurel
yea it was my first time, they invited me and told me they would tell me if I got in there and my dad dropped me off and went to work thinking it was going to take a while and it took me 30 min to go around to find where they were doing the thing. Then I called him and he was kinda mad.


[7/7/2023 10:16 AM] prabipyakurel
will check on that


[7/7/2023 10:17 AM] sskarz
Ahhh your dad definitely wasn’t expecting it to be done so soon haha

[7/7/2023 10:18 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/7/2023 10:19 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/7/2023 10:19 AM] prabipyakurel
Other than that I will probably see what clubs they have at orientation.


[7/7/2023 10:19 AM] sskarz

But this one girl would like answer the question and would take 30 minutes. Dude and she was in my AP lit and AP lang class, I would like hate her, I got an F because I didn't get a chance to speak. I was like donw with her, I wanted to seriously go up to her and be like "shut up dammit"

[7/7/2023 10:27 AM] prabipyakurel
So yea I understand when you say we were forced to be around people in high school.


[7/7/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
The way I would’ve started coughing increasingly louder as she would continue on the seminar


[7/7/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
Just to piss her off lol


[7/7/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
I mean how is that fair


[7/7/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/7/2023 10:30 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/7/2023 10:30 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/7/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz

👀


[7/8/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
have you watched those movies?


[7/8/2023 11:45 PM] prabipyakurel
No


[7/8/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
Ah so the general premise is basically haunted structures, but you view the story through like video cameras


[7/8/2023 11:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Oooo video cameras are sooo fun


[7/8/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
It’s pretty cool and it scared me hard when I was a little kid


[7/8/2023 11:46 PM] prabipyakurel
They are sooo interesting


[7/8/2023 11:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I mean when we were little ghosts were the things our parents told us to scare us


[7/8/2023 11:47 PM] sskarz
Yeah so


[7/8/2023 11:47 PM] sskarz
There are scenes in those movies where it’ll just be a still shot of a hallway

[7/8/2023 11:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm no, well I feel like people that have gone away show signs but not in like a 👻 way.

Do you?


[7/8/2023 11:57 PM] sskarz

[7/8/2023 11:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Not the way it shows on horror movies at least


[7/8/2023 11:57 PM] sskarz
yeah


[7/8/2023 11:58 PM] sskarz
I have had my handful of cases of "ghost" like encounters


[7/8/2023 11:58 PM] prabipyakurel
But does it ever scare you to walk downstairs after everyone is asleep or be able in the house.


[7/8/2023 11:58 PM] sskarz
but I just gaslight myself into thinking it was by some physical causae


[7/8/2023 11:58 PM] sskarz
nah not really

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/8/2023 11:58 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/8/2023 11:59 PM] sskarz
yesterday


[7/8/2023 11:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm it’s okay


[7/9/2023 12:00 AM] sskarz
back when my friends and i were working on the computer


[7/9/2023 12:00 AM] sskarz
we brought the computer back upstairs to work on it, and thats when it all booted and stuff


[7/9/2023 12:00 AM] prabipyakurel
Mhm


[7/9/2023 12:01 AM] sskarz
so imagine this, it was like around 2 am and we were so tired, they were going to go drive back home and i had to clean downstairs. When we all started creeping downstairs silently (because we didn't want to disturb my sister or make any noise), we heard a noise


[7/9/2023 12:01 AM] sskarz
and we all stopped dead in our tracks on the stairs down


[7/9/2023 12:01 AM] prabipyakurel
Lol that feeling 💀


[7/9/2023 12:01 AM] sskarz
and it came from the kitchen, so i thought someone had come into our house or break in or something crazy


[7/9/2023 12:02 AM] prabipyakurel
Probably pulled out your dog huh


[7/9/2023 12:02 AM] sskarz
so i had to go tip toe my way to the living room which connected to the kitchen in the same room


[7/9/2023 12:02 AM] sskarz
and all of a sudden, i hear a bhajan playing


[7/9/2023 12:02 AM] sskarz
just out of nowhere


[7/9/2023 12:02 AM] sskarz
it starts up

[7/9/2023 12:04 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/9/2023 12:04 AM] sskarz
my friends just started saying like, "oh nah god playing with us"


[7/9/2023 12:04 AM] sskarz

[7/9/2023 12:06 AM] sskarz
because we thought someone broke in and needed to check *stealthily*


[7/9/2023 12:06 AM] prabipyakurel

So like every episode there’s a new case for murder, and these lawyers have to basically try and deduct who was the murderer in that episode

[7/9/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
A pretty good method of killing them is also just grabbing the vaccuum


[7/9/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
And just suck them up


[7/9/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
Works like a charm


[7/9/2023 8:26 PM] prabipyakurel
no no no, if there is a spider in my house, I am not getting anything, I will simply just move out of the house

[7/9/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
It was actually a scientific experiment


[7/9/2023 8:31 PM] prabipyakurel
I dont care what its name was, lol spider is still spider


[7/9/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz

[7/9/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/9/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/9/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
is there any bug you are scared of?


[7/9/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
Hmmmmm


[7/9/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
I mean if it’s not squishable, then yeah


[7/9/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
Ok like, crickets


[7/9/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
I’m not scared of them


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
those are like weird you just use a broom and lead them out


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
But they make me jump if they try to jump away from me when I try to kill them


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
And it’s annoying


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
oh yea that feeling is pretty annoying


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
but other than that… I can’t really think of any


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
If squishable, then it’s all good


[7/9/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
damn, i wish i could squish a bug or kill it


[7/9/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/9/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
My stomach is burning so hard


[7/9/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz

Idk what it’s called


[7/9/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
But my god my mouth was burning


[7/9/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
OMG that is just aachar


[7/9/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
it looks so good


[7/9/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
i think its meant to be spicy


[7/9/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
It was way more spicy than typical aachar trust me


[7/9/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
I know but like this was a different beast 💀


[7/9/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
I have a pretty decent spice tolerance and this almost killed me


[7/9/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
oh wow, i love trying deadly spicy things


[7/9/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
I think they may have screwed up the ratio with sweet and spicy lol


[7/9/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
lol maybe maybe

[7/9/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
I tried the ghost pepper chip challenge thing and that scarred me


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
It was so bad


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
that I would not do, I need spice with flavour, not just spice


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
It tasted terrible


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
Yeah same


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
yea, and why did you do that, was it with friends or you just woke up and was like, let me do this?


[7/9/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
It was with friends yeah


[7/9/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
I lost a bet


[7/9/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
Back in high school


[7/9/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
And I didn’t have milk either


[7/9/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
so I literally felt like I was burning from inside out


[7/9/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
for the entire day and the next day I felt like garbage lol


[7/9/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
would not recommend unless you have milk or ice cream on standby


[7/9/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
damn cant even imagine


[7/9/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
yea I wont do those things, there ia a difference between enjoying spicy food and doing a challenge


[7/9/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
yeah it’s best to stay away from those things


[7/9/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
Now something really spicy I enjoy is a good howlin rays sandwich

[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
Put a good show on and that thing is gone by the first episode


[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
spicy chips are way better than normal chips


[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
yep, before it even starts


[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
Yes except for Funyuns


[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
I think the base Funyuns taste better than the spicy variant


[7/9/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
if we are watching a movie and that thing is in front of me, it will be done by the time we choose something to watch

[7/9/2023 8:51 PM] sskarz

[7/9/2023 8:52 PM] sskarz
It’s more fun on a stick imo


[7/9/2023 8:52 PM] sskarz
easier to eat too


[7/9/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
yea, when we go out with mom I usually get the cup but at school I would alternate


[7/9/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
now i cant stop thinking about spicy foods


[7/9/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
maybe gonna make myself spicy pani puri tomorrow

[7/9/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
well after we came back from the shopping spree, all of us had maggi, and my parents went to the puja at the mandir to fishing everything. Now they are picking up pizza for us along the way, so just waiting on that rn.


[7/9/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah I totally forgot about the maggi, mb

[7/9/2023 8:58 PM] prabipyakurel
wbu?


[7/9/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz
hmmm dominos probably


[7/9/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
It used to be this local place called Lampost, but then they stopped serving a special food


[7/9/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
saddens me everyday


[7/9/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
i have never heard of that place, but pizza is good from a lot of places to be honest


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
yep local to El Monte, used to be the king of large pizzas that tasted crazy good


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
Dominos my go to nowadays


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
their garlic parm sauce is too good to pass up


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
nice nice, at alhambra we would usually go to costco or blaze


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
that sounds good


[7/9/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
Costco pizza is insanely good as well, cheap too


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
yea big too


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
have you been to blaze?


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
or pizza studio?


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
Yeah, it’s been a while since I’ve been to blaze


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
The last time I went was Pi day


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
For the $3.14 pizza


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
The line was not worth it tho, it took so long


[7/9/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
lol yea blaze is small but tasty


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
true true


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
The pizza itself was really good


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
Just standing in that line for close to an hour was not ideal lol


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
And it was raining that day


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
yea, that part sucks


[7/9/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
rain is fun, its fun to go out in the rain


[7/9/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
i got scolded by my teacher back in may for opening her door and going into the rain when there was lightning too.


[7/9/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
you ever try that?


[7/9/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh


[7/9/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
Yes if and only if I literally have no responsibilities or anything


[7/9/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
That actually reminds me


[7/9/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
lol, i guess


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
Back in Rome, my sister and I were eating at a restaurant, and soon after we finished, a thunderstorm started


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
oof, did you go out?


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
And there were no taxis available or in sight, they all wanted to avoid the storm


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
bruh


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
So we had to run and walk like 3 miles back in the heavy rain


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
It was so so bad


[7/9/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
thats when they would make the most money, dumb taxi drivers


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
and it was during a time that my eyes were still extremely sensitive to water


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
Since I had my surgery a week prior


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
So my eyes were burning the entire run back to the hotel


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
One of the worst travel memories ever


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
so like in those cases, oh I can’t


[7/9/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea that would suck


[7/9/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
But if it was back home and I was feeling it, then yeah why not it’s fun to get wet


[7/9/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
that must have been scary


[7/9/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz

[7/9/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
No not novels, I think some stories I have written for like small assignment or competitions, but most were like biographies and information based.


[7/9/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/9/2023 9:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I feel like when we were younger our minds were more creative, and you as a kid, I am certain that the piece you wrote was brilliant.


[7/9/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
oh it was nothing like that incredible haha, you give me too much credit


[7/9/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz

[7/9/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
This is from what I remember from some years ago
The setting was a mystical place where people could harness the powers of the planets, as the universe revolved around their world, their lives were destined to revolve space and the universe around them. There were colonies of different planets like Mercury, Earth, Saturn, etc. that all had different ideologies about how the world functions. Many of the conflicts in that society occurred because of conflicting ideas between colonies, and would result in turmoil for both sides. So, an order was formed, The Planetary Order, which harnessed the power of the Sun, and there were only 5 individuals that could wield this power. They were exceptional, right from birth, seen as gods and as the absolute right. Anyone that dared to oppose them were considered outcasts, never to be taken seriously, and always viewed as a threat. 

The story revolved around a man that was falsely accused (this was not known yet in the beginning) of violating the Planetary Order (basically the government), of supposedly murdering a family from the Mars Colony. This man was completely innocent, but was framed by someone else seeing him at the crime scene. He was brought upon the Planetary Order's Court, and deemed sentence to death to eternity. It seemed that this man's fate was sealed, that there was nothing he could possibly do to escape from the chains that binded him to the Court's ground. As the guillotine came down, an explosion happened, the court was attacked by a mysterious group of people. See, there weren't just the planets in the solar system that could give powers, and it wasn't a star either, rather the space that fills the rest of the distance between planets and stars and galaxies. The Void itself, which was infamous for denying government power and always seeked righteousness in the free will. The man is then taken by The Void, and together with that group of people, he seeks to take revenge upon the Planetory Order, and seek the man that framed him.

[7/9/2023 9:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Why don't you continue the story now?


[7/9/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
well... I'd have to find where I stored all that writing somewhere


[7/9/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
or start from scratch


[7/9/2023 9:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Like continue from how you remember and just write, lets the words flow with your imagination and wisdom.


[7/9/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
I definitely could, but I remember hitting a lot of writing blocks


[7/9/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
I always suffered with that inconsistency of creativity


[7/9/2023 9:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahh, but the fact that you explained the summary so well in a couple of minutes was amazing.

Damn you had this planned out huh.

on iphone there is this like screen time tracker that checks how long you use your phone on average across a week and then sends a report, so I've been using that to slowly reduce that as much as I can


[7/10/2023 3:09 PM] prabipyakurel
I know, like looking back at when we were little and how we werent too into all this social media, life was wayyy more peaceful too.


[7/10/2023 3:09 PM] sskarz
fr


[7/10/2023 3:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea that message pops up at the end of every week and sometimes its like wow


[7/10/2023 3:10 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 3:11 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 3:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh see, getting better and better


[7/10/2023 3:13 PM] prabipyakurel
I think its because we have gotten so used to having our phones around, that its tempting to just open it and have a short look at it.


[7/10/2023 3:13 PM] sskarz
yeahhhhhh


[7/10/2023 3:14 PM] sskarz
what's your plan for the rest of today?

Yea hopefully It will taste good.


[7/10/2023 3:16 PM] sskarz
it can't be that hard to make pani puri, i've never tried so i can't say


[7/10/2023 3:17 PM] prabipyakurel
not too hard, its just I never get the amount of salt right and I usually put like less salt in every food i make.


[7/10/2023 3:17 PM] prabipyakurel
You have never made pani puri?


[7/10/2023 3:17 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 3:32 PM] sskarz
one of them was like this psychological podcast that explained different behaviors and disorders every episode


[7/10/2023 3:32 PM] sskarz
and that one was pretty interesting, but at some point it was a bit much


[7/10/2023 3:33 PM] prabipyakurel
That seems pretty interesting yea


[7/10/2023 3:33 PM] prabipyakurel
psychology is kind of interesting


[7/10/2023 3:33 PM] sskarz
i enjoyed that subject back in highschool


[7/10/2023 3:33 PM] sskarz
was genuinely interested in that class


[7/10/2023 3:34 PM] sskarz
so that podcast kinda seemed naturally interesting, but it went into so much detail


[7/10/2023 3:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea i had planned on taking that in high school but I had 7th period and the only space available was 0 period and my counselor looked at me and went, "you really want 8 classes senior year", and then i let it go.

[7/10/2023 4:18 PM] prabipyakurel
right tourist location


[7/10/2023 4:18 PM] prabipyakurel
with the number of murders and deaths there, I dont think tourisy attraction is the right name


[7/10/2023 4:19 PM] prabipyakurel
If you know richard ramirez, the killer, yea he used to stay on the 14th floor


[7/10/2023 4:20 PM] sskarz
Oh


[7/10/2023 4:20 PM] sskarz
Hmmm yeah that’s true


[7/10/2023 4:20 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:19 PM] sskarz
oh nah it scared the crap out of me


[7/10/2023 7:19 PM] prabipyakurel
dreams it might have been because you watched or thought too deeply about those things


[7/10/2023 7:19 PM] prabipyakurel
yea i understand you were little


[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] prabipyakurel
when I was young, I would shut off the lights so fast and run to sleep


[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] sskarz
oh yeah confirmation bias was probably a huge contributor to those experiences lol


[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] sskarz
you were afraid of the dark?


[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] prabipyakurel
for sure


[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:20 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:25 PM] sskarz
like when I was 15 or 16


[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh, did you have like nightmares after or were you like just scared?


[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] prabipyakurel
like when you feel scared


[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] sskarz
nah


[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] prabipyakurel
me neither


[7/10/2023 7:26 PM] sskarz
I mean my parents are the type to listen to that, and then just start laughing which I totally understand now


[7/10/2023 7:27 PM] sskarz
but as a kid, my god that wouldn't have made anything better lol


[7/10/2023 7:27 PM] prabipyakurel
lol all parents do that


[7/10/2023 7:27 PM] prabipyakurel
they be like "there is nothing there, oh its gonna eat you, its gonna take you away"


[7/10/2023 7:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Never made me feel more assured


[7/10/2023 7:28 PM] sskarz
hahaha yeah


[7/10/2023 7:28 PM] sskarz
I would totally do that as a parent


[7/10/2023 7:28 PM] prabipyakurel
lol you be like, "stop being a kid, deal with it"


[7/10/2023 7:29 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:29 PM] sskarz
oh yeah


[7/10/2023 7:29 PM] sskarz

We also need to go bungee jumping, six flags, skydiving and so many do more dangerous things.


[7/10/2023 7:33 PM] sskarz
give me the time and the place, I'm down


[7/10/2023 7:33 PM] sskarz
there aren't many people that are willing to do such things


[7/10/2023 7:33 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:33 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] prabipyakurel
i have not been there, but the rides dont even seem scary


[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
they're a total push over


[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] prabipyakurel
they look like the beginner version of six flags


[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
they are fun, but they're like the elementary to middle school levels of rides


[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm i see


[7/10/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
and then you promote to six flags, where its like high school and college level rides


[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
and voila, you've graduated

[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] prabipyakurel
quite interesting


[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
and then I guess masters and PHD come in the forms of bungee jumping and sky diving


[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
ok i have a question


[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm


[7/10/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
when you're like studying 50 terms of something, like lets say political terms


[7/10/2023 7:38 PM] sskarz
how do you try and remember those 50 terms and their definition


[7/10/2023 7:38 PM] sskarz
what method do you use?


[7/10/2023 7:38 PM] prabipyakurel
I take a line sheet of paper that I split in half and write the rod on one side and definition on the other, say them line by line at least 10 times each, and soon start covering one side of the paper and see if I can say definition just looking at the word and vice versa.


[7/10/2023 7:38 PM] prabipyakurel
HBU?


[7/10/2023 7:39 PM] sskarz
ohhhh so you take it a very literal way of memorization


[7/10/2023 7:39 PM] sskarz
that's cool because I do it totally differrent

[7/10/2023 7:40 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:40 PM] sskarz

[7/10/2023 7:40 PM] prabipyakurel
ahhh yes i have been told to try that, never tried it


[7/10/2023 7:41 PM] sskarz
so like lets say the word is government, and the definition is blah blah blah, I try and remember government and relate it to something like Planetary Order which I created


[7/10/2023 7:41 PM] sskarz
idk helps a lot to remember these things by association


[7/10/2023 7:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, creative mind, I could never.


[7/10/2023 7:41 PM] sskarz
I used to do quizlet setups tho


[7/10/2023 7:41 PM] prabipyakurel
I always just lock myself in a room and need to be able reading it over and over again


[7/10/2023 7:42 PM] sskarz
I can't do that anymore, it would drive my brain to boredom


[7/10/2023 7:42 PM] prabipyakurel
quizlet is fun, thats how i memorized most of the 27 amendments and 50 states and capital

but on the final week, he said if you can memorize the entirety of the periodic table in order and give me the symbols in 2 days, he would give just a few points more


[7/10/2023 7:44 PM] sskarz
on our final


[7/10/2023 7:44 PM] sskarz
so for the next 2 days, i sat down and did association on every single element, and memorized the periodic table song haha


[7/10/2023 7:44 PM] prabipyakurel

Um when I was younger I wanted a dog because I was fine around them but now that I freak out near them. If i were to get a pet I would get a pomeranian because they are like the fluffiest dogs or like bunnies.


[7/11/2023 9:53 AM] prabipyakurel
In nepal, my dad had brought me like 5 bunnies, and all of them had a tragic death and we lost them quickly.

[7/11/2023 9:57 AM] prabipyakurel
did you always have a dog or did you have a different pet before bear?


[7/11/2023 9:57 AM] sskarz
I did have another dog before bear, his name was Mickey


[7/11/2023 9:57 AM] sskarz
and he was a pure GSD


[7/11/2023 9:57 AM] prabipyakurel
aww how you pick these names


[7/11/2023 9:57 AM] prabipyakurel
they are so adorable


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] sskarz
Well my dad had another dog before my Mickey, and his first dog was named Mickey but that passed away when my dad was in his early 20s


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] sskarz
so then he got another dog when I was around 6 years old and we had Mickey


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm i see


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] prabipyakurel
sorry to hear that


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] sskarz
and then he passed away when I was around 14


[7/11/2023 9:58 AM] sskarz
no its okay, its only good memories with him


[7/11/2023 9:59 AM] prabipyakurel
yea just remember the good moments


[7/11/2023 9:59 AM] sskarz
14 or 15 when he passed, I remember I was in sophomore year


[7/11/2023 9:59 AM] prabipyakurel
oh wow


[7/11/2023 9:59 AM] sskarz
and I came back home one day after a week being worried about what happened to Mickey since he went to the hospital


[7/11/2023 10:00 AM] sskarz
and then I saw a new small dog, but I never saw Mickey afterwards so it kind of clicked with me


[7/11/2023 10:00 AM] sskarz
Bear is now around 5 years old


[7/11/2023 10:00 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh thats nice


[7/11/2023 10:00 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:00 AM] prabipyakurel
Or maybe i am just dumb but i thought he was older


[7/11/2023 10:01 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 10:12 AM] prabipyakurel
anyway, you were explaining your bullying incident yesterday, and I totally forgot to get back to you on that.


[7/11/2023 10:12 AM] sskarz
oh yeah


[7/11/2023 10:12 AM] sskarz
well i don't really have like a full on story from my history with being a victim of bullying


[7/11/2023 10:13 AM] sskarz
it never affected me personally


[7/11/2023 10:13 AM] sskarz
like at all


[7/11/2023 10:13 AM] prabipyakurel
oh really, yea you were strong then, I have been like called names, and been hated on for no reason by very specific people.


[7/11/2023 10:14 AM] sskarz
if someone ever tried to call me names or even physically push me or something, i'd either ignore them or respond with a remark of some sort


[7/11/2023 10:14 AM] prabipyakurel
Thats a pretty good strategy


[7/11/2023 10:14 AM] sskarz
i'm sorry to hear that, i know im not like the average person dealing with bullying and it does affect people a lot


[7/11/2023 10:14 AM] sskarz
i hope it doesn't affect you at all


[7/11/2023 10:15 AM] sskarz
oh but there was one story which i found pretty cool back when i was in elementary school


[7/11/2023 10:16 AM] prabipyakurel
lets hear it


[7/11/2023 10:18 AM] sskarz
this one time i had a friend named Pablo and he was a pretty short kid and he used to get bullied by these group of dudes that were bigger and taller than him, like the upperclassmen. anywho one day I was just walking with him and these dudes tried to instigate something with Pablo by pushing him slightly and calling him some dirty stuff and we were on the playground during recess. at some point, for some reason, i just walked up to one of the guys that kept harassing him and straight punched him in the face, and then i took pablo and left. apparently, shortly after I found out that I actually broke a part of his nose, but I explained the situation and I only got detention for about 2 days


[7/11/2023 10:19 AM] prabipyakurel
Damn, you are a really good friend first of all, and wow you were quite a fighter


[7/11/2023 10:19 AM] sskarz
they never tried with pablo, instead i was the one that they kept going at but again it never bothered me and i stopped physically dealing with them


[7/11/2023 10:19 AM] prabipyakurel
he probably deserved to have his nose broken

a complete douchebag


[7/11/2023 10:20 AM] prabipyakurel
That seemed mean


[7/11/2023 10:20 AM] prabipyakurel
honestly I have been in your friends situation and it went on for a while too


[7/11/2023 10:21 AM] prabipyakurel
yea like back in 6th and 7th grade there were these boys who would call me indian, and i had told them many times that I am not indian. THen they would start talking about how I dont belong here and should go back to my county. Just brutal, I would be crying and they would just be laughing. It got to the point where like I didn't want to come to school because I would see them. But in 8th grade we were good and they stopped doing those tasks, probably because i had answers to homework and stuff. But yea they even like threw dirt on my face and stuff like that. As memorable as middle school was there were so many other things that happened that still makes me wonder, why I didnt have it in me to tell anyone or say anything back to them.


[7/11/2023 10:21 AM] sskarz
oh wow, I'm sorry you had to deal with that

from my experience


[7/11/2023 10:22 AM] prabipyakurel
And yea we went to different high school and after I got insta one of them requested to follow me, so i was like its been a while, lets forgive them.


[7/11/2023 10:23 AM] sskarz
that's nice of you, personally if i had experienced what you went through, no way in hell


[7/11/2023 10:23 AM] prabipyakurel
yea my best friend did that, she had instagram in like 6th grade and I told her, I actually cried to her, and then she searched his name, and messaged him directly.

[7/11/2023 10:23 AM] sskarz
that's good, but physical confrontation will always triumph over them


[7/11/2023 10:24 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea if I see them again, no matter how much they apologized, what they did will kind of stay with me


[7/11/2023 10:24 AM] sskarz
now i probably got lucky, since i used to taunt alot of them that tried to harass me, which could've ended poorly but thank god they weren't maniacs


[7/11/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
yeah I can imagine so

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/11/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea thats good, it was good of you to be able to talkback to them


[7/11/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
I always thought they were gonna blame something on me and I would get in trouble


[7/11/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
don't worry


[7/11/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
they never have the balls to do anything


[7/11/2023 10:26 AM] sskarz
usually


[7/11/2023 10:26 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea the older I got I realized it was a them problem not me

[7/11/2023 10:26 AM] sskarz
i mean if u think about it, you're gonna be way more successful than them in the future, and that's how i always thought about it


[7/11/2023 10:26 AM] sskarz
yk?


[7/11/2023 10:26 AM] sskarz
like eh, in the grand scheme of things they are just some pebble in the road


[7/11/2023 10:27 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea you are right, I always had that thought on the back of my head


[7/11/2023 10:27 AM] sskarz
they are tiny compared to our real ambitions 💯


[7/11/2023 10:27 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:28 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
all i knew it by was the show right after spongebob stopped airing for the day on nickleodeon


[7/11/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
yeah its a sheep


[7/11/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:29 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
oh tom and jerry is a banger


[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
loved that show too


[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
i'd say 80% of the shows i watched as a kid was spongebob


[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
to the point there was a time in my life where i had memorized every single episode in every season


[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
because we only had nickleodeon on cable


[7/11/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
for kids shows


[7/11/2023 10:31 AM] prabipyakurel
oh wow, how about now?


[7/11/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz
its foggy, but if i saw the title and maybe the first minute i'd probably remember


[7/11/2023 10:31 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea we had just the normal cable and stuck to PBS kids shows


[7/11/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 10:33 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea why did they do that


[7/11/2023 10:33 AM] prabipyakurel
i thought math was just numbers


[7/11/2023 10:33 AM] sskarz
fr


[7/11/2023 10:33 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 10:33 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 11:10 AM] sskarz
ah nice


[7/11/2023 11:10 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 11:11 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel
did i tell you about the incident where my parents thought we got kidnapped


[7/11/2023 11:12 AM] sskarz
no???????? but am interested


[7/11/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel
So i think it was like 2 weeks ago


[7/11/2023 11:12 AM] prabipyakurel
like around 2 pm the power went out on this house and our neighbors


[7/11/2023 11:13 AM] prabipyakurel
And with no internet, the ring camera all around stopped working, the wifi was no longer here, and data decided to give up.


[7/11/2023 11:13 AM] prabipyakurel
We couldnt call anyone or text or message anyone


[7/11/2023 11:13 AM] prabipyakurel
neither could we receive any calls


[7/11/2023 11:13 AM] prabipyakurel
and then my dad tried several times from work to chek what was wrong with the camera


[7/11/2023 11:14 AM] prabipyakurel
THey thought someone broke in and broke the camera too


[7/11/2023 11:14 AM] prabipyakurel
My mom left work in an emergency and thought someone broke in


[7/11/2023 11:15 AM] prabipyakurel
but thankfully the power came back as she was on her way and I got scolded first then they understood


[7/11/2023 11:15 AM] prabipyakurel
It was kinda hilarious but they were like panicking, so I felt bad for them.


[7/11/2023 11:15 AM] prabipyakurel
😂  yea that pretty much sums up everything


[7/11/2023 11:15 AM] sskarz
omg that's scary tho


[7/11/2023 11:15 AM] sskarz
as a parent i would've been panicking


[7/11/2023 11:16 AM] prabipyakurel
yea we were kinda assuming one of them were gonna come home to check


[7/11/2023 11:16 AM] sskarz
that is pretty terrifying even from your perspective tho


[7/11/2023 11:16 AM] sskarz
i would've grabbed some kind of weapon just in case i was about to get robbed or something

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/11/2023 11:16 AM] prabipyakurel
yea and our neighborhood is quiet, no one is out on sthe streets or anyting during the day


[7/11/2023 11:16 AM] prabipyakurel
lol yea we just locked our doors


[7/11/2023 11:17 AM] prabipyakurel
if anything we were going to take a walk to the south el monte city hall down the street and as if we can make a call.


[7/11/2023 11:17 AM] prabipyakurel
that was like our only option


[7/11/2023 11:17 AM] sskarz
ah that makes sense


[7/11/2023 11:18 AM] sskarz
yeah I would've gone to the nearest gas station or something to ask to make a call


[7/11/2023 11:18 AM] sskarz
but idk with the power gone, maybe that wouldn't have worked


[7/11/2023 11:18 AM] prabipyakurel
yea maybe maybe, how you guys charge tesla with the power gone? I don't know if this is a dumb question.


[7/11/2023 11:19 AM] sskarz
well we have a backup power source, but we wouldn't charge the tesla at home since I'm not sure it can support charging the car with the backup generator


[7/11/2023 11:20 AM] sskarz
in that case, if we have some miles left, then we would just drive down to the nearest super charger and charge there


[7/11/2023 11:20 AM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh I see I see


[7/11/2023 11:20 AM] sskarz
and if that didn't work, then we also have gas cars to use just in case they are all dead in battery, which the chance of that happening is basically 0


[7/11/2023 11:21 AM] prabipyakurel
mhm thats sounds good


[7/11/2023 11:21 AM] sskarz
we haven't had a power outage in a while tho, if we do then its usually my room 💀


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
sometimes i use a bit too much power than intended and then shuts off in the breaker


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] prabipyakurel
lol just your room


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
yep


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] prabipyakurel
rip


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
i've got a computer that takes around 850 Watts on its own, then an entire AC


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] prabipyakurel
oh my


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
that doesn't include the house AC, literally just an AC unit


[7/11/2023 11:22 AM] sskarz
yeah


[7/11/2023 11:23 AM] sskarz
so if i keep both on for a very long time and both are at full use, it can shut down the entire room


[7/11/2023 11:23 AM] sskarz
its happened like twice in the last 4 years so its not a big issue but its there lol


[7/11/2023 11:23 AM] prabipyakurel
thats crazy


[7/11/2023 11:23 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 11:24 AM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 11:24 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 2:41 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/11/2023 2:41 PM] prabipyakurel
those looked pretty interesting


[7/11/2023 2:42 PM] sskarz
ironically that's the place where i get what i need and i get out 💀


[7/11/2023 2:42 PM] sskarz
don't tempt me with the lego death star


[7/11/2023 2:42 PM] prabipyakurel
you mean you dont go to costco, and start from the first isle to the end looking for things you can possibly get


[7/11/2023 2:42 PM] sskarz

[7/11/2023 2:44 PM] sskarz

Hello again, so how has the rest of your day been like, you know aside from your dangerous amazon shopping spree?


[7/11/2023 8:11 PM] sskarz
well


[7/11/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
do you want the long answer or the short answer, or a list of pros and cons


[7/11/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
lets go with the pros and cons


[7/11/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
i like how you have options of explaining


[7/11/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
it must have been interesting lol


[7/11/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
pros:
just had dinner
my dog hugged me
had a meeting where i didn't have to do much


[7/11/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
cons:
my computer literally died
i had to troubleshoot it for 4 hours straight and I've finally gotten to a stable position
my mental health is dwindling as my PC dwindles
i had a meeting during all of that


[7/11/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Aww little doggy hug, the meeting seems pretty easy, what did you have for dinner?


[7/11/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
time to get your computer a friend I guess, you know so when one died its friend can replace it

[7/11/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
idk if you've watched it


[7/11/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
but there was that one ted talk episode where a guy perfectly describes procrastination and how it works in the brain


[7/11/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
and it used like a monkey steering a ship as an example or something like that


[7/11/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
it was one of the more popular episodes


[7/11/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
OH wow, maybe i have not seen that but I will check it out


[7/11/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
yeah its pretty insightful for how it works


[7/11/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
but explained in a very easy to understand way


[7/11/2023 8:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea sometimes like you need to hear someone explain to you that its fine to be behind


[7/11/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
like a week ago I was talking to my berkeley academic advisor and she was talking to like a group of people including me and was like "its okay to feel lost sometimes and feel like you are behind, but you have to look back at how much you have progressed" and that hit me. Now I take my time instead of stressing myself out, somewhat.

[7/13/2023 2:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea, I am okay now, its because I had my classes chosen and my enrollment period began at 12:40. However everyone had different time slots and those that had the time from 9:00 to 11:00, they picked out all the english classes and social science classes.


[7/13/2023 2:14 PM] prabipyakurel
I hate the UC berkeley system right now.


[7/13/2023 2:15 PM] sskarz
omg what?!


[7/13/2023 2:15 PM] sskarz
what did you choose for your classes then?


[7/13/2023 2:15 PM] prabipyakurel
And I have been just scrolling to find a physical science class for the past 30 minutes that doesnt mess with my schedule and fits the time.


[7/13/2023 2:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Well...


[7/13/2023 2:16 PM] prabipyakurel
so far I got Math, History (not the most interesting), and Sociology

hey its okay, you can waitlist and wait for people to drop, but also at least this isn't a major course for you


[7/13/2023 2:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea, I asked and the english can be taken in the spring semester.


[7/13/2023 2:17 PM] prabipyakurel
And because everyone was on the site, it was loading so much, I wanted to throw my laptop downstairs.


[7/13/2023 2:17 PM] prabipyakurel
I even sat next to the wifi routers for it to load faster.

unfortunately this stuff can suck, maybe next semester you can get into early enrollment programs? I'm pretty sure every uni has them


[7/13/2023 2:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I am hoping they do that, I was mad like I was going crazy, this was certainly not fair. And I just talked to my friend that is also going to Berkeley and she has to redo her class pick entirely.

[7/13/2023 2:26 PM] prabipyakurel
likewise


[7/13/2023 2:27 PM] sskarz
so are you planning on sitting in waitlist or have you picked out your last class yet


[7/13/2023 2:28 PM] prabipyakurel
I am not going to rely on waitlist, I am trying to pick one more class that will fufill the philosophy or physical science requirement.


[7/13/2023 2:28 PM] sskarz
have you got a class in mind to fulfill that?


[7/13/2023 2:28 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/14/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
except like the goosebumps series back in elementary school


[7/14/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
that sounds pretty cool


[7/14/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh, but writing in fiction is pretty interesting, it can be taken different ways.


[7/14/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
i mean it doesn't have to be supernatural, it could be like a michael myers situation


[7/14/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz

[7/14/2023 9:51 PM] prabipyakurel
I have tried writing but I lost all those, but I used to read a bunch of those goosebump series and short horror stories.


[7/14/2023 9:51 PM] prabipyakurel
I used to pick a book with multiple short horror stories.


[7/14/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Like it was quick and short.


[7/14/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz

[7/14/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz
have you read IT ?


[7/14/2023 9:53 PM] prabipyakurel
I read half of it, but like clowns arent scary to me, so I lost interest in it.


[7/14/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz
oh really?


[7/14/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz

[7/14/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz

like ghosts, dead people, etc


[7/14/2023 10:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Sorry went to the bathroom real quick.


[7/14/2023 10:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Um other than that, like if someone is choking on food, idk why, I will freeze and like freak out.


[7/14/2023 10:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Occasionally large bodies of water, and being alone in the middle.


[7/14/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz
so the ocean, and being alone in the middle......


[7/14/2023 10:09 PM] prabipyakurel
yep


[7/14/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz
*this sounds all too familiar*


[7/14/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz
*cough* submarine *cough*


[7/14/2023 10:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Right exactly, being stuck too deep into water


[7/14/2023 10:10 PM] prabipyakurel
And also because if I get stuck in water deeper than 4 feet, I wont make it out.


[7/14/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz
💀


[7/14/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz
you still got 11 inches of head room


[7/14/2023 10:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Not enough


[7/14/2023 10:14 PM] prabipyakurel
You can swim right?


[7/14/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
so how about like a stranded ocean story where the characters go through the horrors of living in the ocean alone without anything, maybe encounter an island or something and something scary lurks there


[7/14/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
yep, i used to train back in middle school days

👍 

[7/14/2023 10:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea like that, it is eerie


[7/14/2023 10:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea my swimming is bad bad


[7/14/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
never too late to learn!


[7/14/2023 10:16 PM] prabipyakurel
I can only be in the water if I can at least tiptoe on the pool floor


[7/14/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
oh easy


[7/14/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe sometime in the future, I will learn.


[7/14/2023 10:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Its funny because my dad used to train both me and my brother, but then I was just always scared and needed someone next to me. And I am sure I would still freak out if I tried now too.


[7/14/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
don't worry you won't drown, just gotta paddle it out


[7/14/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
did your dad ever just launch you into like an 8 ft pool?


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
OH NAH, He knew I couldn't get past 5 feet before panicking


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
you?


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Is that how you learned omg


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
yep 💀


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks, gonna try if I am ever in the situation.


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
my dad literally threw me in repeatedly


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
i got gaslight every single time 💀


[7/14/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
I hope he came after you too


[7/14/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
after i struggled for a bit yeah

motto of my life lol


[7/14/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
accurate 😂


[7/14/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
WOW thats a way to learn


[7/14/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats cool though, probably the first time I have heard someone learn swimming straight from 8 feet.


[7/14/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz
haha my dad did the same thing with paragliding


[7/14/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz
have i told you the story?


[7/14/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
OMG no


[7/14/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
but I am interested


[7/14/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Go on...


[7/14/2023 10:24 PM] sskarz
so basically, this was when the new movie Transformers 3 came out, and as you know, i love seeing big robots fighting each other,
and at the time, i was at Nepal, and the movie had just reached the theaters in Nepal.
that day, I wanted to watch the movie, but we ended up scaling a large mountain for paragliding, but I really didn't want to do it and everyone else wanted to.
so at the peak of the mountain, my dad told me that i could watch the movie right after paragliding with everyone else, and i took the bet


[7/14/2023 10:24 PM] sskarz
needless to say it, there was a lot of screaming and i was scared to death 💀


[7/14/2023 10:24 PM] sskarz
I did get to watch the movie the same day tho

[7/14/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
let me search up when that movie came out


[7/14/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
2011 so


[7/14/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
12?


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
I was 12


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
probably 12


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
i am assuming


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
mathematically yes


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean you werent a baby baby, but I can understand.


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
it was like


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
hundreds and hundreds of feet in the air


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Did you go alone, or with someone else?


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
and i was scared of heights at the time


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
i was attached to the guy that flew the paraglider


[7/14/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
so he steered me


[7/14/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea I had that phase too, I used be scared when dad would drive uphill and stuff.


[7/14/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh well at least you didn't go alone.


[7/14/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
You would be fine doing that now right?


[7/14/2023 10:27 PM] sskarz
oh 100%


[7/14/2023 10:27 PM] sskarz
i'd be happy to go paragliding again


[7/14/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
that's why i wanna sky dive lol


[7/14/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
im not scared of heights anymore


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea dw we all had that phase, paragliding and skydiving look so fun.


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
right!


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
idk lots of my fears are gone because my dad just threw me into the danger


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
and i was like, well then it ain't that bad


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
applies to like everything i do lol


[7/14/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
what are your biggest fears? apart from spiders


[7/14/2023 10:30 PM] prabipyakurel
um...


[7/14/2023 10:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I have always been scared to be in an elevator alone


[7/14/2023 10:31 PM] sskarz
how come?


[7/14/2023 10:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Well its because I have read and heard many stories of death on elevators or when it malfunctions and you are stuck in there for good.


[7/14/2023 10:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe I am being overdramatic, but I would rather walk up a bunch of stairs than take it alone.


[7/14/2023 10:32 PM] prabipyakurel
I have done it before, it just makes my heart beat faster.


[7/14/2023 10:33 PM] sskarz
ohhhhhh i see


[7/14/2023 10:33 PM] sskarz
im scared more of that little gap between the floor and the elevator, always thinking im gonna drop my phone in that small gap


[7/14/2023 10:33 PM] sskarz
intrusive thoughts lol


[7/14/2023 10:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea that too


[7/14/2023 10:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Have you ever been somewhere for the first time and you automatically think about what can go wrong?


[7/14/2023 10:34 PM] sskarz
oh easily


[7/14/2023 10:35 PM] sskarz
tho i try not to think too much on it


[7/14/2023 10:35 PM] sskarz
for me its like thinking of where the exits are in every room in case of a shooter or something


[7/14/2023 10:35 PM] sskarz
wbu?


[7/14/2023 10:36 PM] prabipyakurel
I usually look for exits too or what I have with me that can come in handy in case something happens in a situation.


[7/14/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
But other than spiders, drowning, someone choking, elevators, and large bodies of water, I dont think I am too scared of anything else.


[7/14/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
and those are somewhat rare so that's good 👍


[7/14/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[7/14/2023 10:38 PM] sskarz
well, i'm going to head to bed early, need to wake up early tomorrow to be a good teacher

[7/16/2023 7:40 PM] sskarz

Nice nice, pretty calm.


[7/16/2023 7:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Um nothing too much, just going to prepare for college.


[7/16/2023 7:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Get a headstart on reviewing descriptions for some subjects.


[7/16/2023 8:04 PM] sskarz
what subjects are you reviewing for?


[7/16/2023 8:04 PM] sskarz
and which book are you going to start with for english


[7/16/2023 8:16 PM] prabipyakurel
I forgot most of Frankenstein, so gonna start with that. And for subjects, I will look into Sociology, the terms and general information.


[7/16/2023 8:17 PM] sskarz
you're gonna read the entire book? or like sparknotes it


[7/16/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey hey I am sorry for leaving you hanging. I was looking through gmail and for some reason couldn’t access some accounts for books and stuff. Then I was called to eat and completely forgot to get back to you. But yea I am obviously going to spark notes it for rn.


[7/16/2023 10:08 PM] sskarz
Hey no you’re fine dw about it, you got stuff to do and prepare for 👍. Yeah getting a good overview for the foundation of all the books would be a pretty smart move, considering you’re probably going to be writing a lot about themes and motifs


[7/16/2023 10:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea for sure, and yea I appreciate your understanding, sometimes I have a bad habit of starting many things at once and like getting everything mixed up.


[7/16/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
Oh trust me, I know what that feels like 😂

you’re on the study grind tho, are you feeling confident?

Honestly, I felt pretty confident in the beginning but now looking at everything I am not going to lie, I feel a lot more scared.


[7/16/2023 10:36 PM] prabipyakurel

Thank you! Yes definitely I will be taking it little by little so I don't mess up anywhere.


[7/16/2023 10:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Its just that feeling that hits me at the most random time of a day and my brain goes "what if this happens?"

[7/17/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
yeah your brother really wanted to play on it haha


[7/17/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/17/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel

wbu? when was your first time in vegas?


[7/17/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
That is what we did, I think I was also around like 13 or 14 and my brother was like 9 and my other cousin was also 9, and after we all had dinner, they put my cousisns grandparents, me and my cousins in the hotel room and went, "okay we will be back"


[7/17/2023 11:05 PM] prabipyakurel
We just woke up next morning, there was literally no point in taking us lol.


[7/17/2023 11:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Also got told to get out of most places that we followed our cousins and parents into.


[7/17/2023 11:07 PM] sskarz
oh yeah, gambling and stuff everywhere


[7/17/2023 11:08 PM] sskarz
i'd always get kicked out of all the casinos haha


[7/17/2023 11:08 PM] prabipyakurel
I think its better to wait a few years before going there, honestly I dont see a point to go anytime soon.


[7/17/2023 11:08 PM] sskarz
there's no real point to go to vegas unless you got like a show to watch or you're over 21


[7/17/2023 11:08 PM] sskarz
yeah i agree 100%


[7/17/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz
i'm going again this year, and just like last times, gonna be staying at the resort and doing nothing lol

[7/17/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz
i'd rather stay home and enjoy a show alone than going to vegas

lets say you're transported 3 million years into the past. You can only bring 1 object and 1 person with you, and whatever is on your body/clothes. What are you bringing?


[7/17/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
to survive obviously


[7/17/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
the object must be from this time (2023), and the person must be alive today


[7/17/2023 11:36 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/17/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
yes


[7/17/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
so like a cell phone, a flame thrower, etc


[7/17/2023 11:38 PM] prabipyakurel
Object= Phone, person= Elon musk


[7/17/2023 11:39 PM] sskarz
oh what's your reasoning?

Well phone is like a necessity, you can search for stuff and I guess be able to get more resources out of it. Elon musk because dude is Big brain and will probably be easy to work with to help survive or improve and advance better.


[7/17/2023 11:40 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[7/17/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz

Oh lighter is pretty clever, and your dad is smart, great choices.


[7/17/2023 11:43 PM] sskarz
i chose my dad so i wouldn't get lonely or go insane lol


[7/17/2023 11:43 PM] sskarz
plus he's pretty resourceful


[7/17/2023 11:43 PM] prabipyakurel
I see I see, yea a familiar face might be better.


[7/17/2023 11:43 PM] sskarz
and the lighter because fire is enough to scare away most predators


[7/17/2023 11:44 PM] prabipyakurel
You have good survival instincts, I would have died with the dumb cellphone.


[7/17/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
oh no you just didn't think about it for too long 💀


[7/17/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
i sat and talked to my friend about it for like 30 minutes


[7/17/2023 11:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it can be that too lol


[7/17/2023 11:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Wow 30 min, what an intellectual conversation that must have been.


[7/17/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
oh god no we started derailing quickly


[7/17/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
we started deconstructing the definition of an object to squeeze out the most insane things to bring


[7/17/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
ultimately, my friend chose a planet the size of mars to implode and he worked his way to define it as an "object"


[7/17/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
it was most certaintly not an intellectual conversation, more so how much can you get away with 💀

[7/17/2023 11:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I have heard things about the dude too.


[7/17/2023 11:50 PM] sskarz
like he directly receives materials to build his cars and products from mines worked by children and stuff


[7/17/2023 11:50 PM] sskarz
which isn't like directly his fault


[7/17/2023 11:50 PM] sskarz
but supporting that kind of stuff idk


[7/17/2023 11:50 PM] sskarz
also just some questionable decisions on the business side of things, and his political views that i don't agree with

[7/18/2023 3:21 PM] sskarz

[7/18/2023 3:21 PM] sskarz
but i did squeeze out a win when he handicapped himself 💀


[7/18/2023 3:22 PM] sskarz
and that was the last time i went against him


[7/18/2023 3:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Exactly like if I went up against you at chess or something and by some miracle I beat you, that is it, we are not touching chess again lol.


[7/18/2023 3:22 PM] sskarz
so i just gotta keep winning so we can keep playing *takes notes*


[7/18/2023 3:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Correct.


[7/18/2023 3:22 PM] sskarz
im super washed up at chess tho


[7/18/2023 3:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Which game was it that you beat your friend in?


[7/18/2023 3:23 PM] sskarz
i haven't played in a while, all that knowledge is just out the window


[7/18/2023 3:23 PM] sskarz
its a video game you've probably never heard of


[7/18/2023 3:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah but you have been good at it, you won't forget too easily.


[7/18/2023 3:23 PM] prabipyakurel

Do you play wordle?


[7/18/2023 3:26 PM] sskarz
yeah!


[7/18/2023 3:26 PM] sskarz
i had a tradition with my friend that at the start of class while everyone is setting up, we'd compete and see who can do the wordle the fastest


[7/18/2023 3:27 PM] sskarz
we'd be like 5 minutes early and just blitz through it


[7/18/2023 3:27 PM] sskarz
we did it for like a semester straight


[7/18/2023 3:27 PM] sskarz
have you done the wordle today?


[7/18/2023 3:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, I used to do the same with my friends.


[7/18/2023 3:29 PM] prabipyakurel
And i had this one friend that would wait till someone got to keep his streak on getting it on the first try.


[7/18/2023 3:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep, u?

the first few moves in a chess game always have some kind of name

Um so basically you have a grid where you need to put numbers from 1-9 vertically and horizontally, but cant put the same number if it has already been in that row.

[7/18/2023 3:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Like here there are 9 boxes and within each boxes, each number is only there once.


[7/18/2023 3:55 PM] prabipyakurel
And if you see the vertical  and horizontal rows all of them range from 1-9 but dont repeat numbers in the same row.


[7/18/2023 3:56 PM] sskarz
does it only apply for the 3x3 boxes or the entire 9x9 box


[7/18/2023 3:57 PM] prabipyakurel
3x3


[7/18/2023 3:57 PM] prabipyakurel
You can try it on the app, I learned red it that way.


[7/18/2023 3:58 PM] sskarz

[7/18/2023 4:19 PM] sskarz
is that where he plans to attend for high school?


[7/18/2023 4:20 PM] prabipyakurel
At the moment yes, but if addresses and stuff dont work out then it might be mountain view.


[7/18/2023 4:20 PM] sskarz
as long as you have someone living in that area, you should be fine


[7/18/2023 4:20 PM] prabipyakurel

Yea I think once I get there, I will understand that its not as bad.


[7/19/2023 6:18 PM] sskarz
It’s just homesickness I think is what might be difficult, how far is Berkeley from here?


[7/19/2023 6:18 PM] prabipyakurel
7 hours, on drive.

Berkleley is on the other side of the oakland side bridge.

While San Francisco is on the opposite.

[7/19/2023 6:20 PM] sskarz
Are you motion sick like in long drives or on planes?


[7/19/2023 6:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally, we are going to SF saturday to check out the school and with this weather, I can already imagine the car ride there.


[7/19/2023 6:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Not planes, havent been on too many plane rides to feel those, but car rides, when I was little I could not be in a car or a bus, like I felt sick and threw up instantly. When I was in Nepal and we needed to go somewhere on taxi or bus, I needed medication to not throw up.


[7/19/2023 6:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Not as bad now, but sometimes it still feels bad on long drives.


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
Oh I gotcha


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
Yeah definitely keep some of that medication on hand


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
Me not so much


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
It depends on who’s driving for me


[7/19/2023 6:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I dont use it anymore, but I just fall asleep if I feel sick.


[7/19/2023 6:24 PM] sskarz
If the driver does sharp breaks or like sharp turns every time then I get sick very easily


[7/19/2023 6:24 PM] sskarz
But if they drive relatively normal and smooth, it’s no problem


[7/19/2023 6:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea those are terrible especially on curvy roads.


[7/19/2023 6:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea its easier to be with someone who drives smooth.


[7/19/2023 6:25 PM] sskarz
Yeah, you know how some people only break right before they hit the car in front


[7/19/2023 6:25 PM] sskarz
Instead of rolling it to a stop


[7/19/2023 6:25 PM] sskarz

Yea hopefully I get used to driving a little more normally.


[7/19/2023 6:29 PM] sskarz
Please tell me you did the test with a costume on


[7/19/2023 6:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah to nervous to do anything of that sort, I forgot it was Halloween midway through the test.


[7/19/2023 6:30 PM] sskarz
Hahaha it would’ve been so funny


[7/19/2023 6:31 PM] sskarz
Was your instructor nice?


[7/19/2023 6:32 PM] prabipyakurel
IKR yes he was actually and I remember I did this turn a bit too fast and his phone fell into that little space behind the seat belt buckle area and I was like"oh no, this is it, I am done!" I kept saying sorry and he was like no worries, keep going. He eventually got it out in a while and was not too mad about it.


[7/19/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel
OOOO the first instructor that I had he was all grumpy and scary and was kind of mean. I also forgot a speed bump and that was my first mistake with him, he gave up after I have more than 15 mistakes.

[7/19/2023 6:36 PM] prabipyakurel

Bone density doesn’t have anything to do with increasing your height

Unless you cut open your leg and put metal rods between your bones and extend that length


[7/19/2023 6:45 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 6:59 PM] sskarz
She snaps back so fast if you even mention her height 💀


[7/19/2023 6:59 PM] prabipyakurel
That is a very relatable feeling


[7/19/2023 7:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Feels good to get back at the other person sometimes


[7/19/2023 7:00 PM] sskarz
Yeah sometimes she reminds me of an angry chihuahua the way she talks shit 💀


[7/19/2023 7:00 PM] sskarz
She’s funny tho I’ll give her that


[7/19/2023 7:01 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 7:16 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 7:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz
After like a decade of airing it


[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz
Only like 4 seasons


[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea people talka about it a lot, seems to be watched by many.


[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz
Yep


[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz
For good reason I’d say


[7/19/2023 7:18 PM] sskarz
That’s the first episode in a nutshell


[7/19/2023 7:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Plot seems pretty interesting, It would be nice if they made an actual show with people.


[7/19/2023 7:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[7/19/2023 7:19 PM] sskarz
Trust me this can only work in animation


[7/19/2023 7:19 PM] sskarz
Again a very good reason behind that as well lol


[7/19/2023 7:20 PM] prabipyakurel
oh I see


[7/19/2023 7:21 PM] prabipyakurel
but yea after a year of my friends using random memes from this anime, I got to know that it was called attack on titans.


[7/19/2023 7:21 PM] sskarz
Well at least you got the name lol


[7/19/2023 7:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Exactly, something is better than nothing lol


[7/19/2023 7:22 PM] sskarz
ok but do you just not like anime, or all animation in general? Just curious


[7/19/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I think maybe animation in general


[7/19/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Or just the concepts of anime


[7/19/2023 7:23 PM] prabipyakurel
But even when I tried watching the 1st episode of nauto with my brother, I just kinda tuned out.


[7/19/2023 7:24 PM] sskarz
Naruto is uh


[7/19/2023 7:24 PM] sskarz
kinda mid im ngl


[7/19/2023 7:24 PM] sskarz
I loved it as a kid but when I look back at it

[7/19/2023 7:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea show seems kind weird.


[7/19/2023 7:26 PM] sskarz
It’s not that it’s weird, it just take a while for it to really go


[7/19/2023 7:26 PM] sskarz
Idk tho u might think the premise of the show is weird which I can understand where you’re coming from


[7/19/2023 7:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea maybe, or maybe its because I don't give my time to understand an amine and when I watch the first episode and am not interested, I assume I will not be interested through out the rest of the episodes.


[7/19/2023 7:28 PM] sskarz
That’s fair lol


[7/19/2023 7:28 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 7:46 PM] sskarz
Top of the food chain


[7/19/2023 7:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Like one of those that are the size of a pushpin, that is enough to get me out of the room


[7/19/2023 7:46 PM] sskarz
Or I just vacuum then and they just get squished


[7/19/2023 7:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Can do that either


[7/19/2023 7:47 PM] prabipyakurel
I would literally cry in a corner and wait for someone to come get it out


[7/19/2023 7:47 PM] sskarz
Dang you have pretty crazy arachnophobia


[7/19/2023 7:47 PM] prabipyakurel

Can’t do this again💀


[7/19/2023 7:55 PM] prabipyakurel
I feel like time flies by fast when you have nothing to do but are motivated to do other things.


[7/19/2023 7:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Like this one time I had math homework and a presentation over the weekend and I just didn't have it in me to start on math, and I looove presentations and putting slides together, so I went with that and finished like 10-15 slides that day.


[7/19/2023 7:56 PM] prabipyakurel
And time flew by fast too.


[7/19/2023 7:57 PM] sskarz
yeah but like today i just didn't want to do anything at all


[7/19/2023 7:57 PM] sskarz
haven't felt like that in a while


[7/19/2023 7:57 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 7:57 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/19/2023 8:01 PM] sskarz
sounds pretty cool tho


[7/19/2023 8:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea the pattern is pretty fun.


[7/19/2023 8:02 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz

[7/19/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz
looks like you can mess up so easily without focus


[7/19/2023 8:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it makes my brain hurt too, the mushroom is easy tho I was able to do it as a child so its pretty simple.


[7/19/2023 8:08 PM] sskarz

[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/20/2023 5:35 PM] sskarz
No idea


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] prabipyakurel
U still waiting outside?


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] sskarz
This is like worst case scenario rn, I had a meeting planned for 7 and the movie would’ve ended on that hour


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] sskarz
I just want a refund now and come back later lol


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] sskarz
Yep


[7/20/2023 5:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh no, can the meeting be moved or no?


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] sskarz
Unfortunately it’s a mandatory meeting


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] prabipyakurel
They should give you like at least half the money back.


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] sskarz
And I have to attend


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] sskarz

[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Yikes, maybe they will let you in soon and it will end around 6:30/


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] sskarz
No chance, the length of the movie wouldn’t allow it to end on time


[7/20/2023 5:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea then its probably a good idea to head home and come back tomorrow.


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] prabipyakurel
You can watch it over in peace.


[7/20/2023 5:38 PM] sskarz

- straight out from there, went to return at least a dozen amazon packages that took like an hour and a half
- got to work and practiced for the course tomorrow
- 3 different meetings back to back with my club and everest IT stuff
- went to the movie theater to get my refund from yesterday
- at the same time, had to go do a gift exchange with a friend and got food with them
- went back to my house and then to my uncle's house for momo
- got called unexpectedly to go back home and fetch an item and drive back
- and now i'm here

[7/21/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I prefer smaller classes and more intimate teaching sessions where I get to participate and be able to ask questions.


[7/21/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel
But if it is a lecture halls, I will probably use the office hours.


[7/21/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
Same, never was a fan


[7/21/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
it’s way harder to ask questions and also hear the professor at times imo


[7/21/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes, and I don't want to be a teachers pet or anything but I like it when the professor knows my name and will actually listen to my questions.

[7/23/2023 9:45 PM] sskarz
if i remember, its right before i went to one of the dances at my school


[7/23/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
it may not be your cup of tea, this playlists just has a bunch of songs that give that kind of airy vibe with its production


[7/23/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
so like when you want to space your mind out on a drive or something like that

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[7/23/2023 9:47 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/23/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm thanks!


[7/23/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol


[7/23/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz
for the past like 2 years, i've programmed my brain to just fall asleep quicker with music from my phone speaker


[7/23/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz
that's just quiet enough to not disrupt anything


[7/23/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz
idk how it started but its just like that now

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/23/2023 9:50 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, yea I tried that once and forgot to turn off the music


[7/23/2023 9:50 PM] prabipyakurel
And in the morning my phone was like on the floor, and I realized that that was a bad idea


[7/23/2023 9:50 PM] prabipyakurel
I need a timer on the music because I sleep through like the 1st to 2nd song


[7/23/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz
same


[7/23/2023 9:51 PM] prabipyakurel
But I get you


[7/23/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I have never heard of that


[7/23/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz
and so it shows like a bunch of genres and artists that you've listened to over your spotify account's time


[7/23/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 9:59 PM] sskarz

i listen to a lot of variety, outside of hiphop and rap


[7/23/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz

[7/23/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Nice nice.


[7/23/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
What happened to you during 2021, if I may ask?


[7/23/2023 10:04 PM] prabipyakurel
You don’t need to tell me if you aren’t comfortable.


[7/23/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
oh no you're good!


[7/23/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
i actually went through a breakup that was rough


[7/23/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
definitely not a good one lol


[7/23/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh no,  I am so sorry.


[7/23/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
no no you're fine don't worry


[7/23/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
i'm comfortable talking about stuff like this


[7/23/2023 10:06 PM] sskarz
it was a rough time of being confused emotionally


[7/23/2023 10:06 PM] sskarz
ultimately things just did not work out and it was like fireworks for a month


[7/23/2023 10:07 PM] sskarz
but i got back on my feet soon enough, turned my mentality around and i've been so much better since


[7/23/2023 10:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh no I feel so bad, but things get better overtime, just focus on yourself and everything will work out.

Yea my friend also went through in a traumatic way and I have not been in any relationships to give advice but you are an amazing person and sometimes universe tells you to let people go.


[7/23/2023 10:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Again, not a professional person to take advice from.


[7/23/2023 10:08 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:32 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg lol


[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz
he used to be all over him lol


[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I feel like once you see a dog for a while, you get used to it


[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz
100%


[7/24/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
But I just don’t give any dog a chance or myself to get near them


[7/24/2023 1:34 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:35 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:35 PM] sskarz
idk how to explain it


[7/24/2023 1:35 PM] prabipyakurel
No it makes sense


[7/24/2023 1:35 PM] sskarz

[7/24/2023 1:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/24/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
And I wait for someone to pick them up


[7/24/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
i'm personally not the biggest fan of that breed simply becasue as a kid, back at my old house, this neighbor i lived next to had like 5 of them, and they'd all start yapping at the crack of dawn or in the middle of the night


[7/24/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
awwwww that is cute


[7/24/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Ngl I find their barks very sharp


[7/24/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Like not in a good way


[7/24/2023 1:38 PM] prabipyakurel
But yes they are cute, one is chunky and likes to sit and the other keeps messing with him


[7/24/2023 1:38 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s funny


[7/24/2023 1:40 PM] sskarz
oh yeah


[7/24/2023 1:40 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 12:55 PM] prabipyakurel
But the trip was amazing, we came back through the beach area on the 101 freeway and the scenes were like so beautiful.


[7/25/2023 12:56 PM] sskarz
oooooooooh yeah the drive right next to the beach is really nice


[7/25/2023 12:56 PM] sskarz
especially because that breeze can come through the car windows


[7/25/2023 12:56 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:18 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you? other than chess ofc.


[7/25/2023 1:19 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:22 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:23 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:23 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I mean I am always willing to listen to new songs, maybe rap, but don't know what to exactly listen through


[7/25/2023 1:24 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/25/2023 1:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/25/2023 1:26 PM] sskarz
its been a long time since I've played chess so brain muscle memory kicked in haha


[7/25/2023 1:26 PM] sskarz
its a game about pattern recognition, so as soon as you see one of those that you recognize, its a lot easier to act on it


[7/25/2023 1:26 PM] sskarz
if that makes any sense lol


[7/25/2023 1:27 PM] prabipyakurel
yea my brain doesnt work  when playing that game


[7/25/2023 1:27 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:27 PM] prabipyakurel

what happened yesterday?


[7/25/2023 1:36 PM] prabipyakurel
So when we were coming back from SF like an hour away from reaching bakersfield, (about the time when I sent those marvelous cow pictures), we were driving at a pretty constant normal freeway rate. And this guy in a white honda came next to us, flipped us off, looked at my dad and drove in font of him. GOd damn I was about to do the same but my parents said no. Then there was traffic so that guy got stuck wayyyyy behind us. That was karma.


[7/25/2023 1:36 PM] prabipyakurel
lol sorry for taking so long, baba called and I was talking to him too.


[7/25/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz

[7/25/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
oh dang wtf


[7/25/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
i mean yeah the right thing to do is not to provoke any other actions but the way i would've flipped him off too


[7/25/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel

I also have to put everything in the car the same for my aprents to drive as well.


[7/25/2023 2:03 PM] prabipyakurel
yep, its going to take some practice to be able to make quick road decisions driving


[7/25/2023 2:04 PM] sskarz
i used to have a really bad habit panicking when i used to drive early on


[7/25/2023 2:04 PM] sskarz
so like if someone came too close to me in the freeway and edging into my lane, i would like immediately turn to the other lane without checking and so many times that could've gone wrong lol


[7/25/2023 2:05 PM] sskarz
just try to stay calm at all times


[7/25/2023 2:05 PM] sskarz
idk if what i said helps sat all but just from my experience


[7/25/2023 2:05 PM] prabipyakurel
omg i do that on normal roads sometimes


[7/25/2023 2:05 PM] prabipyakurel
especially when i drive pass a bus that is picking up people and merges back into the lane next to me.


[7/25/2023 2:05 PM] sskarz

If I am going to go to a place to take in the scenery, it better not be like looking out the vegas hotel window and seeing buildings lol.


[7/25/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz

In terms of being on earth


[7/25/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
I’d say Tokyo or Singapore


[7/25/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
Because of the culture there


[7/25/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea those places sound awesome.


[7/25/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Why those?


[7/25/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
For Singapore I’d say because of the many many cultures that reside in that country, like one big melting pot and also it’s beautiful


[7/25/2023 11:02 PM] sskarz
For Tokyo I’d say because I love Japanese food and their culture and they have so many beautiful cherry blossom trees and temples that I’d love to explore


[7/25/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
So true, singapore is so beautiful, I wanna visit a lot of asian countries and try on their clothes and learn more about their traditions.

[7/26/2023 12:50 PM] sskarz
Yeah it was like a hot sandstorm levels of heat in there


[7/26/2023 12:51 PM] prabipyakurel
I like how when summer started around June, it was cold and stuff and now that its almost over, it is like "lets make this weather hotter"


[7/26/2023 12:52 PM] sskarz
And it was like gloomy for like a few weeks straight


[7/26/2023 12:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Right


[7/26/2023 12:52 PM] sskarz
And it rained a couple days ago, I miss the rain 😭


[7/26/2023 12:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I miss the rain so much


[7/26/2023 12:53 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean it can be inconvenient, but it feels sooo good to just walk out when its raining and staying inside at the same time.


[7/26/2023 12:53 PM] sskarz
Unrelated but when I saw this I thought about how you need this for bugs 💀

[7/26/2023 12:54 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/26/2023 12:54 PM] prabipyakurel
Even with this I would be doing it from a mile away from the bug


[7/26/2023 12:54 PM] prabipyakurel
it really is


[7/26/2023 12:54 PM] sskarz
You will *probably* kill it with that


[7/26/2023 12:55 PM] prabipyakurel
yea that and anyone else within the radius


[7/26/2023 12:55 PM] sskarz
the poor dorm building 😂


[7/26/2023 12:55 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/26/2023 12:56 PM] sskarz
They gonna sue you not just charge extra wdym 💀


[7/26/2023 12:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Well yea ig that is a possibility too


[7/26/2023 12:56 PM] sskarz
Ok I have a dumb question


[7/26/2023 12:57 PM] sskarz
If you got into a scenario where you have to stand before court, and let’s say you’re a lawyer, can you appoint yourself as your own lawyer


[7/26/2023 12:57 PM] prabipyakurel
hmmmm that is a good question


[7/26/2023 12:58 PM] prabipyakurel
I am sure they can and I probably will.


[7/26/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
it’s probably never happened but it would be funny


[7/26/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
so what’s your plan for today?


[7/26/2023 1:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Don't really have any lol, just binge watching a baking show and I still have like 40% of the course left, so just gonna be going through that.


[7/26/2023 1:02 PM] prabipyakurel
You?


[7/26/2023 1:02 PM] sskarz
I’m gonna be watching a movie in about an hour


[7/26/2023 1:02 PM] sskarz
You’ve probably heard of Oppenheimer


[7/26/2023 1:03 PM] prabipyakurel
omg so many times


[7/26/2023 1:03 PM] prabipyakurel
like everywhere


[7/26/2023 1:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Don't know what its about though?


[7/26/2023 1:03 PM] sskarz
Yeah it’s pretty popular because it’s directed by Christopher Nolan


[7/26/2023 1:03 PM] sskarz
It’s the story and development of the first atom bomb


[7/26/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
oh wow


[7/26/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
I always wondered how they did that


[7/26/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz
you split an atom and kaboom


[7/26/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz
Or something like that lol


[7/26/2023 1:05 PM] prabipyakurel
So simple


[7/26/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz
it’s a 3 hour movie so I’m gonna be strapped in for a good while


[7/26/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz

Thats a while, are you going alone?


[7/26/2023 1:06 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:06 PM] sskarz
Yup, I like going to the movies whether I’m with friends and family or not


[7/26/2023 1:07 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/26/2023 1:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Jokes on them, they will probably be stading outside with the rest.

[7/26/2023 1:13 PM] sskarz
Yep


[7/26/2023 1:13 PM] prabipyakurel
yea that happens every once in a while


[7/26/2023 1:14 PM] sskarz
It’s like you sit up in bed and then stare at the floor for a good 5 minutes, sigh and get up


[7/26/2023 1:14 PM] sskarz
It’s like that every morning lol


[7/26/2023 1:15 PM] prabipyakurel
That is so accurate, like you dont even know lol.


[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Have you ever had an alarm to wake up and you wake up to find like 5 minutes before your alarm goes off so you just go to sleep until it rings?


[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] sskarz
TOO MANY TIMES LOL


[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] prabipyakurel
I thought it was only me


[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] sskarz
I actually hate when that happens


[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/26/2023 1:16 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:20 PM] sskarz
Mhmmm let me know how you like it


[7/26/2023 1:20 PM] prabipyakurel
For sure, when I put music on from a playslit, I just let it go because I am too lazy to keep choosing the ones I know


[7/26/2023 1:20 PM] prabipyakurel
So I will just discover some good songs


[7/26/2023 1:21 PM] sskarz
Do you have Spotify premium btw?


[7/26/2023 1:21 PM] prabipyakurel
No, just regular


[7/26/2023 1:21 PM] prabipyakurel
you?


[7/26/2023 1:21 PM] sskarz
I do the student plan


[7/26/2023 1:21 PM] sskarz
I was asking because there’s a cool feature where you can listen along with someone at the same time and add songs to listen to together


[7/26/2023 1:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Aww actually i have heard that you can connect


[7/26/2023 1:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Pretty cool


[7/26/2023 1:22 PM] sskarz
Oh really? I’ve never tried it so idk how it would work


[7/26/2023 1:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Not too sure, but friends have done it


[7/26/2023 1:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe they have premium or something


[7/26/2023 1:24 PM] sskarz
Yeah it sounds pretty neat

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/26/2023 1:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Because I only listen to music when I clean or have like a hands on project, or putting some thing together, I cant do schoolwork with music on, I need silence.


[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz
Oh really?


[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Do you listen to music when completing school work?


[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea i cant be listening to anything


[7/26/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Especially when I am reading a book or smething

[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah I can’t read papers or books with music on


[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:26 PM] prabipyakurel
I read the wrong thing when I listen and read


[7/26/2023 1:27 PM] prabipyakurel
I can write with music on tho, that feels pretty good


[7/26/2023 1:28 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:30 PM] sskarz
Idk what season that ended off on


[7/26/2023 1:30 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:34 PM] prabipyakurel
I think I have seen it on my page, but havent watched it


[7/26/2023 1:35 PM] sskarz
I know you’re not super into superheroes but it’s basically about a guy that’s completely blind but he is a vigilante crime fighter at night and a lawyer by day


[7/26/2023 1:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhhh wait wait


[7/26/2023 1:35 PM] prabipyakurel
I have heard of it though


[7/26/2023 1:35 PM] sskarz
So he solves cases as a lawyer and then finds truths out as a blind vigilante


[7/26/2023 1:36 PM] sskarz
yes it’s a really good show I’d highly recommend it


[7/26/2023 1:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Is it not on netflix?


[7/26/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
It should be


[7/26/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
That’s where I watched it


[7/26/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
Ohhhhhhh it might’ve moved to Disney plus recently because of the whole marvel thingy


[7/26/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh thats probably what happened


[7/26/2023 1:39 PM] sskarz
Mhmmm that sucks

[7/26/2023 1:39 PM] prabipyakurel
???


[7/26/2023 1:40 PM] sskarz
So I just found out that some package is getting shipped to my house and I learned from an email. I traced the package order and apparently a vinyl that I ordered 9 MONTHS ago is finally arriving sometime this month


[7/26/2023 1:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh thats great news, and 9 MONTHS ago?


[7/26/2023 1:41 PM] prabipyakurel
lmao


[7/26/2023 1:41 PM] sskarz
I bought this vinyl long ago because it was on backorder and I really wanted it, but it’s so rare to get one because it stopped production on those. And that vinyl costs about $350


[7/26/2023 1:41 PM] sskarz
I bought it for $50


[7/26/2023 1:41 PM] sskarz
For completely unsealed vinyl and it looked like it was on complete back order and never shipping again


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] sskarz
And I forgot to refund it


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] sskarz
But apparently they got one and sending it to me now


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, and they sent it tho, so thats good.


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] sskarz
Yeah I was super surprised


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Did i show you a picture of a wall full of vinyls at berkeley?


[7/26/2023 1:42 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 1:52 PM] prabipyakurel
oh wait, little cars and hot wheels


[7/26/2023 1:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I don't know too much about cars, but they are so cuteee


[7/26/2023 1:52 PM] sskarz
Ohhhhhhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhhhh


[7/26/2023 1:52 PM] sskarz
gotta love them


[7/26/2023 1:52 PM] sskarz
Like hot wheels?


[7/26/2023 1:53 PM] prabipyakurel
I didnt even mean to collect, but I just kept them


[7/26/2023 1:53 PM] sskarz
Or like mini replicas


[7/26/2023 1:53 PM] prabipyakurel
replicas


[7/26/2023 1:53 PM] sskarz
that’s so sick


[7/26/2023 1:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I am not like obsessed or anything, but its just there and I dust them every once in a while.

Tell me how the movie goes, I will talk to you after you are done!


[7/26/2023 1:54 PM] sskarz
For sure! I’ll talk to you later :)

[7/26/2023 6:25 PM] sskarz
Yeah so I just finished watching Oppenheimer and as you saw my story, I thought it was amazing


[7/26/2023 6:26 PM] sskarz
Those were the fastest 3 hours I swear lol


[7/26/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Nice nice, glad you were able to watch it without the fire alarm lol.


[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] sskarz
yeah I think you’d like the movie too


[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] sskarz
There’s a LOT of politics


[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh


[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] sskarz
And it’s very very interesting

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] sskarz
Twists and turns everywhere


[7/26/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
I love it when there is like the biggest plot twist in movies


[7/26/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
The feeling I got from watching that movie is like if you were peering into a history book in visual form, and you were actually living in their time


[7/26/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
WW2 to Cold War era


[7/26/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel
That sounds so cool


[7/26/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel
That must have felt amazing


[7/26/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
And I think this movie is even more enjoyable especially if you know the specific history behind the atom bomb and Oppenheimer


[7/26/2023 6:36 PM] sskarz
Yeah it was incredible


[7/26/2023 6:36 PM] sskarz
Very historically accurate


[7/26/2023 6:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Sounds amazing!


[7/26/2023 6:36 PM] sskarz
I will say tho it is rated R for a reason


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Is it because its gory or...


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] sskarz
it’s not gore, it’s nudity


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] sskarz
2 scenes


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] prabipyakurel
lmao i see


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] sskarz
But thankfully not emphasized at all


[7/26/2023 6:37 PM] prabipyakurel
lol yea some movies are really like that


[7/26/2023 6:38 PM] prabipyakurel
like they could have no added it, but its just a few scenes that make it kinda weird


[7/26/2023 6:38 PM] sskarz
Mhmmmm


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] sskarz
It was to portray a different side of a character which I get it but still lol


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] sskarz
But yeah


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh that makes sense


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] sskarz
The story is told in a genius way


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Is it like 1st person or 3rd person?


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] sskarz
Without spoiling, it’s told from beginning and end at the same time


[7/26/2023 6:39 PM] sskarz
If that makes sense


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] sskarz
You see the aftermath of actions and then you’ll see what led up to that point


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] sskarz
Like you knew the ending when the movie already had started, it’s just the feeling of wonder of how it all came to be


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh like that


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] sskarz
which is just fascinating


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
So basically what led up to it


[7/26/2023 6:40 PM] sskarz
Mhmm


[7/26/2023 6:41 PM] prabipyakurel
nice nice


[7/26/2023 6:41 PM] sskarz
I wish I could talk more about it but there is just so much that would spoil lol


[7/26/2023 6:42 PM] prabipyakurel
lol I mean idk when I would actually watch it so, its probably fine


[7/26/2023 6:42 PM] prabipyakurel
why did you give it 9.5 out of 10, why not 10?


[7/26/2023 6:42 PM] sskarz
Very specific parts of the movie felt unnecessary


[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] sskarz
Not too many, just a few scenes felt like it didn’t need explaining or they went into it too much without it amounting to much


[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] prabipyakurel
oooo lol, I was like damn he was so specific with that last point.


[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] sskarz
Everything else tho


[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] prabipyakurel
I understand


[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] sskarz
Just amazing

{Reactions}
👏 

[7/26/2023 6:43 PM] sskarz
And the cinematography and motifs behind certain camera shots and color choices


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] sskarz
Like there’s a section of the movie that’s just in black and white and having to figure out why it’s portrayed in such a way it’s incredible


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea some people put a lot of effort in movies and it shows


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] sskarz
So many hidden meanings behind character motives and their ambitions for their actions


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] prabipyakurel
its like a hidden mystery


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] sskarz
Yeah


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] sskarz
It is super cryptic at times


[7/26/2023 6:44 PM] sskarz
Like when politics gets involved


[7/26/2023 6:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahh


[7/26/2023 6:45 PM] sskarz
It’s very political heavy like 80% of the movie


[7/26/2023 6:45 PM] sskarz
Because it exists in the time of Hitler and the communist party


[7/26/2023 6:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats a big percentage, i mean its based on the atomic bomb so I assume it would be involved in politics.


[7/26/2023 6:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn hitler


[7/26/2023 6:46 PM] sskarz
OHHHH dude I felt so smart one time


[7/26/2023 6:46 PM] sskarz
So Oppenheimer was writing a bunch of formulas on the board and calculating the physics behind neutrons and how they move and stuff


[7/26/2023 6:46 PM] sskarz
And I actually recognized a couple formulas from my physics class


[7/26/2023 6:46 PM] prabipyakurel
oh wow


[7/26/2023 6:46 PM] sskarz
And I was like OHHHHH that’s dope


[7/26/2023 6:47 PM] sskarz
Like the rotation formulas, the formula for energy


[7/26/2023 6:47 PM] prabipyakurel
The moment hits different when you rememebr something you learned in school si applied in real life.

You are like an actual genius if you remembered a physics formula lol


[7/26/2023 6:48 PM] prabipyakurel
I can see why you felt smart!


[7/26/2023 6:50 PM] sskarz
I blame my physics professor, he practically burned them inside my cornea


[7/26/2023 6:50 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol shout out to him


[7/26/2023 6:50 PM] sskarz
Oh hell naw that guy deserves the worst 💀


[7/26/2023 6:50 PM] sskarz
Jk jk


[7/26/2023 6:50 PM] sskarz

[7/26/2023 6:51 PM] prabipyakurel
skills


[7/26/2023 6:51 PM] prabipyakurel
dang, what did he do to you?


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
Well for starters he gave us double the tests compared to other professors


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
And our class had an average percentage of 35% on each test


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh my


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I hate teachers that assign tests


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
For perspective, my highest test scores was a B-


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
I ended with an A when he rounded our grades


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
But still


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I manages to pass with A for both semesters but it was like a 92


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz
He did that at the LAST DAY of class


[7/26/2023 6:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I barely made it


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] sskarz
Same


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] sskarz
I ended with a 90 💀


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] sskarz
Literally on the edge


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats good for physics tho


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] prabipyakurel
I just didnt want my GPA to drop than the previous year


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] prabipyakurel
dont like going home with that face


[7/26/2023 6:53 PM] prabipyakurel
So I was like praying


[7/26/2023 6:54 PM] sskarz
Yeah that must’ve been scary


[7/26/2023 6:54 PM] sskarz
My grade in my physics class was a C+ till the last day when he rounded everyone’s grade up


[7/26/2023 6:54 PM] sskarz
Most people failed


[7/26/2023 6:54 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean the GPA would have stayed above 4, but still feels so bad to know you were just a few points off


[7/26/2023 6:54 PM] sskarz
100%


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] sskarz
I get that


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh cruel dude, waited till the last day


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] prabipyakurel
I hope that professors do the same to his kids lol


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] sskarz
Yeah we all begged to him as a class and he would always make fake promises


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] sskarz
Like he always said he’d round tests but he never did


[7/26/2023 6:55 PM] sskarz
Till the last day


[7/26/2023 6:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea mines was mean but he was really nice at the same time


[7/26/2023 6:56 PM] prabipyakurel
He used to chase the football players around and teach them how physics worked by physically demonstrating on them


[7/26/2023 6:56 PM] sskarz
Wtf 💀


[7/26/2023 6:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea like told them to hit him or like throw a ball across to someone in the room to prove a point


[7/26/2023 6:59 PM] prabipyakurel
but he loved to talk about video games and anime


[7/26/2023 6:59 PM] prabipyakurel
and like during tests he would let us write whatever notes we could fit in a index card.


[7/26/2023 6:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I would write so small on those


[7/26/2023 7:12 PM] sskarz
oh you gotta


[7/26/2023 7:12 PM] sskarz
that reminds me


[7/26/2023 7:13 PM] sskarz
my friend outsmarted my professor on those like cheat index cards by writing out his notes on a tablet, shrinking it, and then printing it on the index card


[7/26/2023 7:13 PM] sskarz
worked like a charm and the professor had no say on it lol


[7/26/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
OMG that is so clever


[7/26/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea my brain doesnt think of those things


[7/26/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I literally wrote like everything out


[7/26/2023 7:22 PM] sskarz
definitely steal his idea haha


[7/26/2023 7:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Well if I am able to do that for college yes


[7/26/2023 7:23 PM] sskarz
so how's your day been so far?


[7/26/2023 7:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Um I am at the last part of my alcohol course, made roti to eat with veggies for dinner, cleaned my room a little and that is pretty much it.


[7/26/2023 7:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Yours?


[7/26/2023 7:28 PM] sskarz
oh nice nice, remember don't drink alcohol too much otherwise bad things happen 👍

[7/26/2023 7:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks for the advice dude, you speaking from experience?


[7/26/2023 7:29 PM] sskarz
nope 👍


[7/26/2023 7:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh was it like a normal haircut or like one of those fancy one

[7/26/2023 7:29 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] prabipyakurel
No because some people go crazy with haircuts


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] sskarz
is it just me or does like every person have a specific barber


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] sskarz
i just go to my local haircut place and they cut it simple


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg that is my dad


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] sskarz
idk if im the odd one out on that or not


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] prabipyakurel
he goes all the way to alhambra to one asian lady and gets it done


[7/26/2023 7:30 PM] prabipyakurel
No no you arent


[7/26/2023 7:31 PM] prabipyakurel
for me I only go like once in a while to trimm my hair, so it changes but for my brother and dad, its the same.


[7/26/2023 7:33 PM] sskarz
do you like to keep your hair long?


[7/26/2023 7:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea like not too long just enough to be able to look good with hair down and be able to tie it when needed


[7/26/2023 7:34 PM] sskarz
damn seems like i need to find one specific too lol


[7/26/2023 7:34 PM] sskarz
ah i gotcha


[7/26/2023 7:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea i think its because they know how the person wants it


[7/26/2023 7:35 PM] sskarz
that's true but they be going like every week


[7/26/2023 7:35 PM] prabipyakurel
like my dad gets the same type of haircut like everytime


[7/26/2023 7:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Totally normal


[7/26/2023 7:39 PM] prabipyakurel

I do that when I have too much work and don't know where to start or when something is wrong with the computer and I don't know how to fix it. 😂


[7/27/2023 1:28 PM] sskarz
yeah i just wanna see it again and try to understand it more lol


[7/27/2023 1:29 PM] sskarz
and see my friends' reactions


[7/27/2023 1:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea a movie is still fun watch the 2nd time around too.

How about you?


[7/28/2023 11:39 AM] sskarz
I slept pretty late and I've just been in a rush this morning to prepare for my parents coming back tomorrow lol


[7/28/2023 11:39 AM] sskarz
cleaning the house and backyard stuff


[7/28/2023 11:40 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see, it must feel pretty good knowing they are coming back.


[7/28/2023 11:40 AM] prabipyakurel
Is it like really messy or ok?


[7/28/2023 11:40 AM] sskarz
yeah I miss them, glad they're finally coming back


[7/28/2023 11:40 AM] sskarz
It's not super messy, just had to put stuff in order and do a deep clean of the house

[7/28/2023 11:41 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:42 AM] prabipyakurel
Uh one of my friends messaged me at 12:40 this morning asking me how to write an argumentative essay and I dont know if he read the story yet or not, so probably gonna help him. Other than that we shall see.


[7/28/2023 11:42 AM] prabipyakurel
Yep music always helps.


[7/28/2023 11:42 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:42 AM] prabipyakurel
I think so, maybe I am not too sure


[7/28/2023 11:43 AM] prabipyakurel
He is going to PCC so maybe they start earlier or something


[7/28/2023 11:43 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:43 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:44 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/28/2023 11:44 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:45 AM] sskarz
my friends wanted to go watch oppenheimer so I might join them, but i just found out that the theater is like completely packed


[7/28/2023 11:45 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh right


[7/28/2023 11:45 AM] sskarz
so I'm trying to figure something out


[7/28/2023 11:45 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/28/2023 11:46 AM] prabipyakurel
Maybe like some other place has spots


[7/28/2023 11:46 AM] prabipyakurel
Some of my friends went and watched both yesterday


[7/28/2023 11:46 AM] prabipyakurel
They called it barbenheimer 😂


[7/28/2023 11:46 AM] sskarz
yeah its a trend where you watch both on the same day back to back


[7/28/2023 11:47 AM] sskarz
because you go from super happy and funny to peering into a mind of complex emotions and internal battles


[7/28/2023 11:47 AM] sskarz
and its just jarring lol


[7/28/2023 11:48 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea its probably gonna feel weird transitioning from barbie with all that pink and stuff to like wars and battles lol


[7/28/2023 11:49 AM] sskarz
well its not wars, its just about a guy that made the best and worst thing mankind had ever seen


[7/28/2023 11:49 AM] sskarz
did your friends like oppenheimer?


[7/28/2023 11:49 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea they loved it, said it was amazing


[7/28/2023 11:49 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:52 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:52 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/28/2023 11:53 AM] sskarz

[7/28/2023 11:53 AM] prabipyakurel
I mean if I was working and that order came in, I would forget half of it automatically.

[7/28/2023 11:55 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea they always seems to have a lot going on.


[7/28/2023 11:55 AM] prabipyakurel

other forms of life, yeah of course


[7/28/2023 12:27 PM] prabipyakurel
its something to think about for sure


[7/28/2023 12:28 PM] sskarz
the chances that we're the only living conscious is astronimically low


[7/28/2023 12:28 PM] prabipyakurel
It is, I feel like there are other forms of life out there, but don't really think that there are UFO or that the life looks like the aliens that we think of rn.

As for my day, I helped my friend write a rhetorical analysis essay and got through a 30 episode drama (40 min each) all today only to find out that the last episode is getting released next week.


[7/29/2023 6:06 PM] sskarz
THE LAST EPISODE NOOOOOOO


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] sskarz
that’s actually tragic


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] prabipyakurel
I know, I was devastated.


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] sskarz
Good on you for helping your friend tho


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea he was taking summer classes at PCC so he wouldn't have to take it during the year.


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] sskarz
I literally am finally sitting down since I woke up in the morning


[7/29/2023 6:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow.

[7/29/2023 6:08 PM] sskarz
Had the 5 hour class in the morning, then dropped off Amazon return stuff, then picked up lunch, then picked up parents from LAX

Nice nice.


[7/29/2023 6:11 PM] sskarz
I was like dying


[7/29/2023 6:11 PM] sskarz
I caught one of my students cheating and now I’m just wondering what to do about it


[7/29/2023 6:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh


[7/29/2023 6:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Like on an exam type or something else?


[7/29/2023 6:12 PM] sskarz
Nope on their homework


[7/29/2023 6:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn, does the kid know that you know?


[7/29/2023 6:12 PM] sskarz
He used an AI to do it for him and I confirmed it, but the problem is that he’s actually really smart and one of the best students in the class, he’s just lazy


[7/29/2023 6:12 PM] sskarz
Nope


[7/29/2023 6:12 PM] sskarz
Not yet anyway


[7/29/2023 6:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh, well maybe ask him privately how he is doing and he is struggling anywhere.


[7/29/2023 6:13 PM] sskarz
I doubt he’s struggling with anything


[7/29/2023 6:13 PM] sskarz
Tbh


[7/29/2023 6:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm I see


[7/29/2023 6:13 PM] sskarz
He did almost perfectly today on the kahoot quiz today


[7/29/2023 6:14 PM] sskarz
And he usually does


[7/29/2023 6:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe he was just lazy, maybe if he repeats it, you can talk to him.


[7/29/2023 6:14 PM] sskarz
And I know he’s capable because I had him as a student last year and he was one of the best students then too


[7/29/2023 6:14 PM] sskarz
True


[7/29/2023 6:14 PM] sskarz
Idk never thought I’d be in this position


[7/29/2023 6:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh then I am sure that they will be fine, don't stress about it, but if it keeps happening maybe confronting him about why he is doing so is probably the best.


[7/29/2023 6:15 PM] sskarz
Yeah I just don’t want him to rely on that for everything for his own sake


[7/29/2023 6:15 PM] sskarz
There comes a time where even AI gets certain things wrong with enough complexity


[7/29/2023 6:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Don't stress too much about it, I am sure you will figure out something.


[7/29/2023 6:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep I understand, too much AI is never good.


[7/29/2023 6:17 PM] sskarz
Yepppp


[7/29/2023 6:18 PM] sskarz
This wasn’t a problem last year 💀


[7/29/2023 6:18 PM] sskarz
Technology moves so quickly it’s awesome but also scary

Do u think we’d ever be like under the dangers of rogue AI?


[7/29/2023 6:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes, quite often actually.


[7/29/2023 6:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I feel like there needs to be a limit to technology and how we are advancing it. I mean yes we need to improve and have advanced technology, but there are things that don't need technology and can be left alone.


[7/29/2023 6:22 PM] prabipyakurel
AI is messing with everyone and everything in one way or another lol.


[7/29/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
Yeah it’s getting a little too good at certain things lol


[7/29/2023 6:24 PM] sskarz
I agree I think it should be limited from its actual crazy potential


[7/29/2023 6:24 PM] prabipyakurel
I kind of miss when there was just enough technology, like not too much and not too little.


[7/29/2023 6:24 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/29/2023 6:24 PM] sskarz

[7/29/2023 6:27 PM] sskarz
Why are they on TikTok that is actually so bad


[7/29/2023 6:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Its not doing good, especially for the upcoming generations.


[7/29/2023 6:28 PM] sskarz
the attention span of the next generation about to be records low I swear


[7/29/2023 6:28 PM] prabipyakurel
They will be in a friendship circle and be texting instead of talking.


[7/29/2023 6:28 PM] sskarz
That is WILD


[7/29/2023 6:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Technology is scary and I am sure that there is more to come.

I mean I’ve heard people had to dissect pigs instead of frogs so I consider myself lucky 😵‍💫


[7/29/2023 6:45 PM] prabipyakurel
I actually enjoyed chem more, maybe because it was over online learning and all the tests were open notes.


[7/29/2023 6:45 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah 100% LOL


[7/29/2023 6:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea dissecting anything is gross

[7/29/2023 6:47 PM] prabipyakurel
I am sure the last time I heard that they misplaced mines and were like freaking out


[7/29/2023 6:47 PM] prabipyakurel

Which scares me


[7/29/2023 6:52 PM] prabipyakurel
No if its good, then you are fine.

Good Morning! Yesterday was quite busy, I drove for quite a while and got that practice in. And ended off with dinner at cousins. How about you?


[7/31/2023 11:00 AM] sskarz
Oh nice! Yeah it’s good to get some quality driving practice in, hopefully you’re feeling a little more comfortable around the roads


[7/31/2023 11:01 AM] sskarz
Basically just prepared for next weeks class and a bunch of chores and stuff


[7/31/2023 11:01 AM] sskarz
I worked and then napped and worked then went to sleep lol


[7/31/2023 11:02 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea a little more comfortable, I got scolded by dad for going through the wrong side and parking in a parking lot.


[7/31/2023 11:02 AM] prabipyakurel
Nice nice


[7/31/2023 11:03 AM] prabipyakurel

I told my dad to take a day off but he insisted so we just got to doing everything yesterday


[7/31/2023 11:04 AM] sskarz
RIP like you went into the wrong side of the road?


[7/31/2023 11:05 AM] prabipyakurel
Like you know when you enter a parking lot there are arrows indicating which way you go, yea I went in the right way and was supposed to park on the parallel side, but i turned left to the opposing side. Realized the front of the car went in but back of the car would have hit the other parked car.


[7/31/2023 11:05 AM] prabipyakurel
Idk if that makes sense.


[7/31/2023 11:06 AM] sskarz
Ohhhhhhhh


[7/31/2023 11:06 AM] sskarz
Were the parking spots kind of angled too?


[7/31/2023 11:06 AM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[7/31/2023 11:06 AM] prabipyakurel
those diagonal ones


[7/31/2023 11:07 AM] sskarz
Yeah so it’s supposed to help you park if you park in the right direction


[7/31/2023 11:07 AM] sskarz
So if you’re going straight and the arrow says to go straight, then the spots on the right are your spots usually

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/31/2023 11:07 AM] sskarz
Sometimes they have 2 arrows per lane and that separates both sides


[7/31/2023 11:08 AM] prabipyakurel
Exaclty, and me being me turned to the spot on the left.

{Reactions}
😂 

[7/31/2023 11:08 AM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 11:15 AM] sskarz
the quarter system just sounds like its a summer semester in terms of pacing


[7/31/2023 11:15 AM] sskarz
and that sounds like hell


[7/31/2023 11:16 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea your midterms would be the week after classes start

[7/31/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Things just keep adding up.


[7/31/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
orientation is gonna be essential to be a part of


[7/31/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz

How was your dinner?


[7/31/2023 9:41 PM] sskarz
it was good, finally had some fresh dinner made by my mom in a really long time lol


[7/31/2023 9:41 PM] sskarz
i got so tired of eating out or eating some food she stored weeks prior


[7/31/2023 9:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh lol yea eventually take out becomes too much


[7/31/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
mhmmmmm


[7/31/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
and it costs too much


[7/31/2023 9:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea fr, sometimes its better to just make something at home.


[7/31/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz
i did make some food but i can only do so much lol


[7/31/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz
i'm not that experienced


[7/31/2023 9:43 PM] prabipyakurel
That is what my mom is afraid of. She thinks imma forget to eat rice and stuff over there and stick to fast food.


[7/31/2023 9:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah its alright, I can only make a few dishes as well, I am sure your cooking is fine.

[7/31/2023 9:44 PM] sskarz
its so easy to get sick of food not just from fast food, but everything i swear


[7/31/2023 9:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg yea once you have something, you need to at least give it a week before having it again.


[7/31/2023 9:45 PM] sskarz
yeah


[7/31/2023 9:45 PM] sskarz
i was so tired after the first week lol


[7/31/2023 9:45 PM] sskarz
and it went on for like a month


[7/31/2023 9:46 PM] prabipyakurel
lol, and its home made food, that hits different.


[7/31/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
frrrr


[7/31/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
and its way cheaper to make 😂


[7/31/2023 9:46 PM] sskarz
the way my bank account was crying

{Reactions}
😂 

[7/31/2023 9:46 PM] prabipyakurel
And that is another good reason


[7/31/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
wait


[7/31/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
did your dorm have a kitchen?


[7/31/2023 9:47 PM] sskarz
i think they usually do


[7/31/2023 9:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Nope, no kitchen or sink


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
not even a public kitchen?


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
there is a kitchen at the bottom of the building but its for like 100+ people to use


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Not clean


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
ah


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
yeah that's true


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
We got a microwave and mini fridge to share tho


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] sskarz
that's nice


[7/31/2023 9:48 PM] prabipyakurel
And I got a big water bottle that will hopefully fit in there and keep my water cold.


[7/31/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz
oooo like a hydro flask?


[7/31/2023 9:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah the half gallon one


[7/31/2023 9:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Keep getting scolded for not drinking enough water.


[7/31/2023 9:49 PM] sskarz
but those are so good to keep your water cold, the ice stays for so long


[7/31/2023 9:50 PM] sskarz
hydro check, drink water now


[7/31/2023 9:50 PM] sskarz
im gonna drink some as well


[7/31/2023 9:50 PM] prabipyakurel
I can't even get through a normal hydroflask size water bottle though the day.


[7/31/2023 9:50 PM] sskarz
oh you gotta

{Reactions}
👍 

[7/31/2023 9:50 PM] sskarz
its important to keep yourself hydrated


[7/31/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz
a thing i do that helps with me stay hydrated is like keeping my water bottle in my line of sight


[7/31/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz
so it just makes me more obligated to drink more


[7/31/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep really gotta start doing that


[7/31/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks.


[7/31/2023 9:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I just forget, like it goes through my mind.


[7/31/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz
it happens


[7/31/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz
but it is pretty important for health


[7/31/2023 9:54 PM] sskarz
now that i think about it, have you heard anything about your dorm mate?


[7/31/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Um no actually, have no idea who I will be with.


[7/31/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel
My friend is trying because she doesnt like her housing location.


[7/31/2023 9:56 PM] prabipyakurel
But they can only take so many requests.


[7/31/2023 9:56 PM] sskarz
aw damn


[7/31/2023 9:56 PM] sskarz
was she already denied or just straight ignored


[7/31/2023 9:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Just ignored lol


[7/31/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
rip


[7/31/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
yeah there's probably hundreds of people also requesting change so it makes sense


[7/31/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep, but now we just have to see.


[7/31/2023 10:09 PM] prabipyakurel
So you just chilling, not sleepy yet?


[7/31/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz
not really sleepy


[7/31/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 10:14 PM] prabipyakurel

When you like can’t fall asleep


[7/31/2023 10:15 PM] sskarz
yeah and then i open up youtube and it just goes away lol


[7/31/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
gets exhausting thinking about that stuff


[7/31/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
i just trust things will be ok if i'm in my right mind


[7/31/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep that’s the way to go


[7/31/2023 10:18 PM] prabipyakurel
You ever feel like you don’t know what you are doing even when things are going good


[7/31/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
all the time


[7/31/2023 10:21 PM] prabipyakurel
U were typing 😂


[7/31/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
No no you go


[7/31/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
i think about it literally everytime something goes right for me


[7/31/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
i've just come to accept the fact that there's not a point in thinking about what could go wrong if you can go in it with full confidence


[7/31/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
because you'll more than likely succeed more often with full confidence than none

{Reactions}
💯 

[7/31/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Aye that’s pretty good actually, yea I need to start building more confidence


[7/31/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
some weird thing to think about it


[7/31/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
but that's how i see it


[7/31/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
i still fear the unknown


[7/31/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
No I see, it’s okay tho, as long as you get the words right, the accent can be a little bland


[7/31/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
No worries

Oh I know, some people really be sounding so weird


[7/31/2023 10:43 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 10:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Right, don’t you love to laugh at people when they fall or something instead of asking them if they are okay right away.


[7/31/2023 10:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Or am I just evil


[7/31/2023 10:47 PM] sskarz

Ooo yea people tell me to do that.


[7/31/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz
100%


[7/31/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz
50% of a class' difficulty is on the professor


[7/31/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
if its a good professor, that 50% is off and its just way easier


[7/31/2023 10:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I am just scared for my philosophy class, I hope the dude is not too heavy on the philosophical aspects of the work.


[7/31/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
always make sure your professors are the ones that will help you succeed

[7/31/2023 10:58 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 10:58 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
trust me, you're going to want to


[7/31/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
read their reviews for the classes you're taking and make a judgement based off how they teach and their curriculum


[7/31/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm yea for sure.


[7/31/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea hopefully they are all somewhat nice and easy going


[7/31/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
there are some out there that are just teaching for just the money

[7/31/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
the terrible professors i mean


[7/31/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
there are professors like them


[7/31/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
and a lot more than you'd think


[7/31/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
a lot of the times they do teaching on the side and they have another primary job that they have to take more attention to


[7/31/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
so you're like an after thought


[7/31/2023 11:05 PM] sskarz
i had a cs professor that worked with nasa actively but taught us on the side as well


[7/31/2023 11:05 PM] sskarz
now he wasn't terrible, but there are those that will still not put any effort into the teaching


[7/31/2023 11:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[7/31/2023 11:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I get your point, imma make sure to read up on them carefully and make sure that I get the teaching for the amount of money imma pay.

[7/31/2023 11:10 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 11:12 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 11:12 PM] sskarz
you ever sleep with your glasses on?


[7/31/2023 11:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Nope, unless I fall asleep somewhere downstairs or at other peoples houses.


[7/31/2023 11:13 PM] prabipyakurel
But I take them off


[7/31/2023 11:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Have you?


[7/31/2023 11:13 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:13 PM] sskarz
when i literally drop dead


[7/31/2023 11:14 PM] sskarz
and i can't even react to put them away before i go to sleep


[7/31/2023 11:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh, that has happened like once, I just get scared I will end up sleeping on it and break it


[7/31/2023 11:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Because like I need them to see, eyesight is not the best without them


[7/31/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz
what's your prescription?


[7/31/2023 11:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Negative .75


[7/31/2023 11:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe even worse now


[7/31/2023 11:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Yours?

[7/31/2023 11:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Unless it’s for pictures


[7/31/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
you don't like wearing your glasses in pictures?


[7/31/2023 11:24 PM] prabipyakurel
No I do, but like when I wear Nepali clothes, I like the change of a picture without my glasses


[7/31/2023 11:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Looks different


[7/31/2023 11:24 PM] sskarz
oh i seeee

[7/31/2023 11:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol I am sure you look fine without your glasses, maybe because you had it on for so long, it doesn’t feel right without it


[7/31/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
yeah but idk


[7/31/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
just feels so weird and wrong


[7/31/2023 11:26 PM] sskarz
19 years of looking a certain way till not is jarring


[7/31/2023 11:26 PM] prabipyakurel
No I understand if I am in jeans and t shirt, I need my glasses


[7/31/2023 11:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[7/31/2023 11:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe when I am a little older, like after bachelors perhaps


[7/31/2023 11:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Don’t wanna do anything to my eye just yet, when I have the time, I think I will.


[7/31/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:29 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:30 PM] prabipyakurel
We’re  you writing


[7/31/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I was just going to ask if you felt anything during the surgery, like did it hurt?


[7/31/2023 11:32 PM] sskarz
no they gave me anxiety pills to take and then they numbed my eye with some drops


[7/31/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
so when they started going on my eye, i felt nothing


[7/31/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
not even pressure


[7/31/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
so it really felt like i was about to ascend to heaven

{Reactions}
😂 

[7/31/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
until i saw the scalpel going across my vision and then everything started going wonky


[7/31/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
like idk how to explain it


[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz

[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yikes, sounds pretty funny tho


[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz

im ngl that's when i learned i was not afraid of death


[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
i felt at peace when going through that 10 minute process


[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
literally


[7/31/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
like


[7/31/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
you can't hear anything, can't see anything, barely can feel the bed you're sleeping on


[7/31/2023 11:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh damn


[7/31/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
its like if you died


[7/31/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
surreal


[7/31/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
and then once the operation was done, its like if you literally went blind


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Ooooo


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
like im talking


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
the last prescription before declared blindness


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
like everything is blurry, even if they're right next to your face


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] prabipyakurel
That’s crazy


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
like a foggy dashboard of your car


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
how your windshield is in fog and it just won't wipe away


[7/31/2023 11:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
so you can't see anything


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
yeah like that


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
its wild


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
but once i slept like 16 hours and i woke up


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea that must have felt a little scary


[7/31/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
its like crystal clear

👍 

[7/31/2023 11:38 PM] prabipyakurel
Wow, I thought that those that did eye surgery would be able to see clearly right away


[7/31/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
nope


[7/31/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
actually quite the contrary, you have to literally close your eyes all day


[7/31/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
you can't see screens or they litearlly burn your retina


[7/31/2023 11:38 PM] sskarz
so you have to go straight home, and go to sleep


[7/31/2023 11:39 PM] sskarz
so i slept at like 2 pm, woke up multiple times throughout the night but i kept my eyes shut


[7/31/2023 11:39 PM] sskarz
its painful for that one day


[7/31/2023 11:39 PM] sskarz
not as in literal pain, but like not being able to do anything


[7/31/2023 11:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh I see, that’s wild tho.


[7/31/2023 11:40 PM] prabipyakurel
You don’t feel pain or anything now right?


[7/31/2023 11:40 PM] sskarz
nope


[7/31/2023 11:40 PM] sskarz
only if i stare at a screen for like 10 hours straight


[7/31/2023 11:40 PM] sskarz
but that's like normal for most people anyway


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
the only thing


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
is that your astigmatism goes through the roof


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
at least for my procedure


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
i didn't do actual LASIK, i did something called SMILE


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
which is a form of LASIK but it comes with different properties


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
such as heightened astigmatism


[7/31/2023 11:41 PM] sskarz
so bright small lights have that huge glow around them


[7/31/2023 11:42 PM] sskarz
if you drive at night you might know what im talking about


[7/31/2023 11:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhhhhhh

like this


[7/31/2023 11:42 PM] sskarz
its more than what they show on the picture


[7/31/2023 11:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg I see this every once in a while


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
really?


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
so maybe you have light astigmatism


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it only happens sometimes but yea sometimes it looks like that


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] prabipyakurel
I thought seeing that was normal


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
it is normal


[7/31/2023 11:44 PM] sskarz
astigmatism is normal


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
most people have it lol


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
and its not a big deal in terms of our eyesight


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
and how it impacts how far you can see


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Gotcha


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
are you near sighted or far sighted?


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Near sighted


[7/31/2023 11:45 PM] sskarz
oh okay that's great


[7/31/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
because its a lot easier to do LASIK with near sightedness than far


[7/31/2023 11:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea my dad is far sighted, he can’t read off a paper in front of him but you put it at a distance and he will read it


[7/31/2023 11:46 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[7/31/2023 11:46 PM] sskarz
i used to be near sighted


[7/31/2023 11:47 PM] sskarz
far sighted have the big issues with trying to improve their eyesight


[7/31/2023 11:47 PM] sskarz
im no optomoterist tho so idk the specific details as to why


[7/31/2023 11:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm I see


[7/31/2023 11:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea idk eyes are weird to understand


[7/31/2023 11:48 PM] sskarz
they're pretty cool


[7/31/2023 11:48 PM] sskarz
but complicated


[7/31/2023 11:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol yep


[7/31/2023 11:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey I am going to head to bed for now, it was great talking to you as always.

[8/1/2023 12:57 PM] sskarz

[8/1/2023 12:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it was kinda uncomfortable because of the weather but I randomly passed out.


[8/1/2023 12:57 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
i passed out like 2 mins after my last text haha


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
i had such a weird vivid nightmare


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol that was me too


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] prabipyakurel
vivid nightmare?


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
yeah


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
it was super weird and confusing


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
i thought it was so real until i woke up


[8/1/2023 12:58 PM] sskarz
when i realized i was being delusional in my sleep


[8/1/2023 12:59 PM] prabipyakurel
damn


[8/1/2023 12:59 PM] prabipyakurel
what did you see?


[8/1/2023 1:00 PM] sskarz
basically i was talking to someone i really did not like in my past and i was confused as to why i was talking with them in the first place


[8/1/2023 1:00 PM] sskarz
and then i got like death threats and it was just what


[8/1/2023 1:00 PM] prabipyakurel
geez, thats odd


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
yeah


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Like you hated that person?


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
i did yeah


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
i still do, but its been a long time since i've even thought about them


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
so i was really confused when i saw them in my dream for no reason


[8/1/2023 1:01 PM] sskarz
i swear it was like lucid dreaming


[8/1/2023 1:03 PM] sskarz
i can't really explain why i hated that person just because there's a lot of history in it, but i really don't like when people emotionally manipulate and have the freedom to do that when they threaten to kill themselves


[8/1/2023 1:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Yikes, yea forget about those people


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Don't even think about them.


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] sskarz
i haven't till last night lol


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] sskarz
they were part of my early high school days


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] sskarz
its been years


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh I see


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Were your friends before or,  just classmates?


[8/1/2023 1:04 PM] sskarz
when i first met them we were friends


[8/1/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz
but you know no one really shows themselves for who they are based off first meet


[8/1/2023 1:05 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea I understand


[8/1/2023 1:05 PM] sskarz
you catch onto things as time goes on and i learned


[8/1/2023 1:05 PM] prabipyakurel
wow, sorry that you had to see them again.


[8/1/2023 1:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Was it a group of people?


[8/1/2023 1:06 PM] sskarz
it was one person for the most part


[8/1/2023 1:06 PM] sskarz
but the group they were part of were also problematic for diferent reasons


[8/1/2023 1:06 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm okay


[8/1/2023 1:07 PM] sskarz
i was just shocked for the most part


[8/1/2023 1:07 PM] sskarz
i forgot they existed for a while


[8/1/2023 1:07 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/1/2023 1:09 PM] sskarz

[8/1/2023 1:09 PM] sskarz

[8/1/2023 1:10 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/1/2023 1:12 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:02 PM] sskarz
How was your day yesterday? I didn’t get to ask


[8/2/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Good afternoon, no worries, no need to apologize lol. Um yesterday was not too busy, we just had a normal day. I took all my clothes out from my closet and made a mess, then decided yesterday wasnt the day to start organizing, so i shoved everything back in there aggressively. Then we had a small puja at night, which was pretty much it.


[8/2/2023 1:04 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[8/2/2023 1:06 PM] sskarz
Ah you must’ve felt pretty overloaded


[8/2/2023 1:07 PM] prabipyakurel
A little but I will just fix it another day.


[8/2/2023 1:07 PM] prabipyakurel
How is your project coming along?


[8/2/2023 1:07 PM] sskarz
It’s going good, haven’t got to work on it today yet


[8/2/2023 1:08 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:08 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:24 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz
I like playing with them but I don’t really go too crazy


[8/2/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmmm maybe you just haven't met a cute little kid yet.


[8/2/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz
Oh no trust me I have 😂


[8/2/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I become a baby with babies

[8/2/2023 1:26 PM] prabipyakurel
You dont like ever go to a little kid and pick them up or play peak-a-boo with them?


[8/2/2023 1:27 PM] sskarz
I do but not for long


[8/2/2023 1:27 PM] prabipyakurel
I see


[8/2/2023 1:28 PM] sskarz
It might be because I was also an annoying kid so maybe somewhere something happened I’m just not too crazy about kids


[8/2/2023 1:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah you are not annoying, but you are funny, but i understand where you are coming from.

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/2/2023 1:30 PM] sskarz
no no I mean as a kid I was definitely annoying 💀


[8/2/2023 1:30 PM] sskarz
Like 5 - 6 year old


[8/2/2023 1:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh lol sorry, woops, I mean i was annoying as a kid too, sometimes still am.


[8/2/2023 1:31 PM] prabipyakurel
After the age of 5, its pretty predictable that a kid will be somewhat annoying


[8/2/2023 1:31 PM] sskarz
Haha you are far from annoying

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/2/2023 1:31 PM] sskarz
It’s a canon event for every kid


[8/2/2023 1:31 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/2/2023 1:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Do you have any other plans for the day?


[8/2/2023 1:32 PM] sskarz
Haven’t thought about it yet


[8/2/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz
I was going to go to the gym earlier today but I wanted to wait for the family to leave so I can say bye


[8/2/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz
Still here so till then I’m not doing anything


[8/2/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahh lol its okay maybe you can skip gym for the day.


[8/2/2023 1:34 PM] sskarz
Impossible


[8/2/2023 1:34 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:34 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Some people have an entire routine, you know those aesthetic ones and all, and I am here sitting wondering what will come up for the day.


[8/2/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
Duuuuuuuude yeah


[8/2/2023 1:37 PM] sskarz
Sometimes I do have that routine but it’s often interrupted by random events lol


[8/2/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh always, like I will be like imma do this today and parents be like get ready in 10 min, we going out somewhere.


[8/2/2023 1:38 PM] sskarz
OMG I hate when they do that


[8/2/2023 1:38 PM] sskarz
Like I’ll ask if we’re doing anything at all today, they’ll say no, then sometime later that day we have a plan to do something all of a sudden


[8/2/2023 1:38 PM] prabipyakurel
No sometimes when I am bored af i don't mind, but when I needed to get something done, ooooo its bad.


[8/2/2023 1:38 PM] sskarz
Yeah same here


[8/2/2023 1:38 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes they make plans on the spot, within 5 min


[8/2/2023 1:39 PM] sskarz
Ikr and it’s like that one day where you need to do something specific


[8/2/2023 1:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Its so relatable and sometimes its a plan that you never expected.


[8/2/2023 1:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Like you don't even know why you are going there and to do what exactly.


[8/2/2023 1:41 PM] sskarz
Me every time I’m going to a Nepali event


[8/2/2023 1:41 PM] prabipyakurel
😂


[8/2/2023 1:42 PM] sskarz
I swear they’ll be like, oh it’s a barthamun, but I’d have to figure it out who was the one that had to go bald 💀

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/2/2023 1:42 PM] prabipyakurel
lmao, one of those where you have to figure out the main character of the event situation


[8/2/2023 1:42 PM] prabipyakurel
I be just following for the food


[8/2/2023 1:43 PM] sskarz
frrrrr


[8/2/2023 1:43 PM] sskarz
And it’s always at the same venues every time


[8/2/2023 1:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Nepali people when they find one good venue, everyone is gonna use it for something .


[8/2/2023 1:44 PM] sskarz
So I ask my parents which venue it is and if it’s a one with terrible food, I try my best to convince them that I don’t want to go 😂


[8/2/2023 1:44 PM] prabipyakurel
omg yessssss


[8/2/2023 1:44 PM] sskarz
If it’s not good food and the event is something I don’t care about then it’s just recipe for disaster


[8/2/2023 1:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally gonna be bored for hours


[8/2/2023 1:45 PM] prabipyakurel
When you have to go to a nepali even do you ever think about the possibility of you meeting someone you can talk to and if you can't think of any, you dont go.


[8/2/2023 1:45 PM] prabipyakurel
idk if that is only me


[8/2/2023 1:45 PM] sskarz
Omg yes that’s the third requirement


[8/2/2023 1:45 PM] sskarz
I gotta know someone there that I can talk to


[8/2/2023 1:45 PM] sskarz
Like if you’re at an event, I’ll go cuz at least we can talk


[8/2/2023 1:46 PM] sskarz
If there’s no one I know I DEFINITELY don’t wanna go


[8/2/2023 1:46 PM] prabipyakurel
ahhhh lol the 3rd requirement


[8/2/2023 1:46 PM] sskarz
I don’t wanna be that guy in the corner sleeping or on the phone all the time


[8/2/2023 1:46 PM] prabipyakurel
For sure, love it when I can talk to someone and not just sitting there looking at groups of uncles and aunties having conversations

[8/2/2023 1:48 PM] sskarz
I remember it used to be like every weekend


[8/2/2023 1:48 PM] sskarz
and I was so tired of them


[8/2/2023 1:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Actually like it was a party for some of the most simple things


[8/2/2023 1:49 PM] prabipyakurel
maybe also because when we were younger, there werent as much nepali people and now you will meet a new one at every function lol


[8/2/2023 1:49 PM] sskarz
Yeahhhhhhh


[8/2/2023 1:49 PM] sskarz
I feel like recently there’s been a large influx of Nepali people living in California


[8/2/2023 1:51 PM] sskarz
Like new people


[8/2/2023 1:51 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea a lot of new people


[8/2/2023 1:51 PM] sskarz
I used to be able to recognize everyone at a party


[8/2/2023 1:51 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 1:56 PM] sskarz
We’re like stalking some people on instagram on some tea


[8/2/2023 1:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[8/2/2023 1:56 PM] prabipyakurel
That sounds fun


[8/2/2023 1:57 PM] sskarz
nah I have no idea what’s going on 💀


[8/2/2023 1:57 PM] sskarz
I just looked for a second and they’re stalking some Nepali twins or something


[8/2/2023 1:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol yea insta is fun for stalking people, not that I do that, it is still new to me so I discover something new every once in a while.


[8/2/2023 1:59 PM] sskarz
Ohhhhhh I forget you’re new to the social media space


[8/2/2023 1:59 PM] sskarz
I don’t do insta stalking but my sister loves to so I just listen to her stories


[8/2/2023 1:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep, i honestly wouldnt have gotten it if my friends didnt keep telling me I would mane any friends or connections with out insta


[8/2/2023 2:00 PM] sskarz
It’s definitely harder to connect without these apps but it’s not all that necessary


[8/2/2023 2:00 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean sometimes its fun to type the name of celebs and people from you school you knew nothing about and see what they are like.


[8/2/2023 2:00 PM] sskarz
True


[8/2/2023 2:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[8/2/2023 2:01 PM] prabipyakurel
I would sometimes just type the weirdest names to see if someone with that name exists lol


[8/2/2023 2:03 PM] sskarz
Same lol


[8/2/2023 2:03 PM] sskarz
I search up some people who I haven’t seen or heard from in years and it’s always a shock to see how they are now


[8/2/2023 2:04 PM] prabipyakurel
lol me too


[8/2/2023 2:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Well hey, imma let you spend time with family and I will catch up with you later. Also, you can skip gym for a day, you will be fine, i promise lol.

[8/2/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/2/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz
But that was about 2 hours ago


[8/2/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Caffeine is good.

Nah I’m just joking, tho my gym partner does that and looks at his past texts with his ex as a motivator 😭

OMG why would you do that.

U got this


[8/2/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks for the motivation, when I saw the email today, I was like actually pretty bummed out because I thought that the worst was moving away from family, and the feeling of being with new people alone is another thing to add to the list.


[8/2/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
Orrr playing as your angels advocate, you can hang out with some people that and enjoy their company to have the best time you can


[8/2/2023 10:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmm ig I can give that a try


[8/2/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe it won't be as bad as I am making it and I won't end up lonely.


[8/2/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz

How long do you usually stay at the gym?


[8/2/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
Uh it depends


[8/2/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
If I’m not feeling it as much then I go for at least 30 minutes but I go as hard as I can


[8/2/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
But I’m pumped then I stay for around an hour and a half to 2 hours


[8/2/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
I still go as hard as I can


[8/2/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
If you ever wanna see progress, gotta give it your all in anything you want


[8/2/2023 10:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh I see.


[8/2/2023 10:29 PM] sskarz
So tonight I did an hour session


[8/2/2023 10:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats actually pretty good advice, I will use that if and when I start going to the gym.


[8/2/2023 10:30 PM] sskarz

[8/2/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Um at the moment because I don’t really go out too much and feel kinda awkward.

No you should, that is great.

[8/3/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes pretty excited, although I don't know how I feel about one of them, but I will just be myself and I think it will be fine.


[8/3/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz
why do you think that of a specific person?


[8/3/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Well she messages us in a group first and was really nice, but when I checked her insta, the pictures were a little different than I expected.


[8/3/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
oh?


[8/3/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
interesting


[8/3/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz

Yea I think I have to meet her and see

Like is it bad bad


[8/3/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
Yeah I’ve been keeping myself awake all day with caffeine just so I don’t stagger my sleep schedule


[8/3/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
I just couldn’t go to sleep yesterday no matter what, it happens like every other month once idk why


[8/3/2023 10:51 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh my, yea I get that but make sure you take care of yourself, sleep is important.


[8/3/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz

[8/3/2023 10:51 PM] prabipyakurel
You didn’t try hot tea?


[8/3/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz

[8/5/2023 4:03 PM] prabipyakurel
OMG like a few months also there was a spider near my room and I told my dad to remove it and throw it OUTSIDE and he took it and just dropped it down the stairs and said, "there its gone", that thing is probably big now and laying eggs.


[8/5/2023 4:03 PM] sskarz
yeah but like how cool would it be to own a flamethrower


[8/5/2023 4:03 PM] sskarz

[8/6/2023 11:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Well it wasn’t all that bad either, the food was real good, and this one kid names Alan he was adorable, younger than the rest and kept coming up to me for more yogurt and lalmon. Then we got little gifts and there was a mini crystal and I accidentally dropped it. Yea life.

[8/7/2023 12:03 AM] prabipyakurel
And the rest was pretty much my parents, I was just there eating dessert.

[8/8/2023 8:56 PM] sskarz
i think for the first time in a really long time, i feel like im powerless


[8/8/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
No it’s alright, sometimes when too many things are thrown at you at once, life gets kinda boring and exhausting, but after a good night sleep you should be good to go tomorrow.


[8/8/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
that's what i thought too, but I've started to feel like this for a little bit now


[8/8/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
idk just thinking about it


[8/8/2023 8:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Are you worried about anything specific or thinking too much about something?


[8/8/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz
I can't explain everything, but I feel like I'm being pulled to do so many things that I can't focus at all


[8/8/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz
like spreading thin


[8/8/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz
these past couple of days really made me feel like no matter how much I try to focus to do the things I want to do, something interrupts and its like I can't get a grip


[8/8/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz
sorry for venting to you


[8/8/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey no no, I am always here if you want to talk, it’s okay.

[8/8/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe rewarding yourself often with like little treats or taking breaks often is what you need.


[8/8/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
writing how you feel on a paper or sharing is always a good way to release all that you are feeling.


[8/8/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
But I can tell you will be just fine, take time for yourself, don’t take in too much and try to space things out as much as possible.


[8/8/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Idk if this helped, but yea like I said you can always just share how you are feeling when you are feeling stressed and overwhelmed.

[8/8/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
I feel like I put so many things on my own plate to make myself busy for the summer, that I just put too much


[8/8/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
And now I'm heavily regretting it


[8/8/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
No I completely understand, I did so many unnecessary studying and preparing which I really didn’t need and now that it’s over I think to myself what have I done for myself.


[8/8/2023 9:04 PM] sskarz
I'm really contemplating on quitting on one of them, but its difficult when friends are involved that I don't want to let down. But at the same time I don't know how much longer I can keep doing it.


[8/8/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
yeah, sometimes its just so much

{Reactions}
💯 

[8/8/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Well sometimes its okay to let your friends know that you can only devote a certian amount of time into something. I am sure they will understand where you are coming from, you have a lot of leadership positions and teach also, that is a lot. Its okay, let your friends know and it wont be like you are letting them down. Just do as much as you are able to.


[8/8/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
that's probably the best thing for me


[8/8/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea you deserve rest and you need it to, no shame in asking for some space and time every once in a while.

[8/8/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
All I know is I'm not making this mistake again


[8/8/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
At the cost of being able to be productive every minute of every day, my mental health just tanked


[8/8/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea everything in life teaches us something, so maybe drop some things that are just there to make your brain hurt.


[8/8/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
Don't do what I do lol, time for yourself also matters and I just completely lost track of that


[8/8/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
too many things


[8/8/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I am still trying to improve on giving myself time, at this point whenever good things happen multiple times in a row, I can't be happy with a straight face because I feel like something is going to come crashing down.


[8/8/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Many people have told me to make time for myself because I don't do that. I really got to stop talking in too much than I can handle, so you are not alone.

Hey you look fine without glasses, not too much of a difference.

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[8/11/2023 10:32 AM] prabipyakurel
I think its because you get used to being around everyone with them on that when they are not on it feels weird and uncomfortable


[8/11/2023 10:33 AM] prabipyakurel
idk if thats only me


[8/11/2023 10:33 AM] sskarz
Yeah 100%

Literally the only times


[8/11/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz
Okay question, have you tried using contacts before?

Nope, they seemed too annoying and too much work


[8/11/2023 1:25 PM] sskarz
Yeah I agree with that


[8/11/2023 1:25 PM] prabipyakurel
My brother had and he got tired of them and he got rid of them

And that’s when I was like nope


[8/11/2023 1:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/11/2023 1:31 PM] sskarz
It’s like my brain doesn’t even get to process what I say in the moment till after and then it’s instant regret 💀


[8/11/2023 1:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Right, god that is so relatable


[8/11/2023 1:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn I have been mean so many times now that I think about it


[8/11/2023 1:32 PM] sskarz

[8/11/2023 1:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah it was never intentionally


[8/11/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
So when my friend’s boyfriend cheated on her, I told her to run him over so…


[8/11/2023 1:33 PM] sskarz
Honestly valid


[8/11/2023 1:33 PM] prabipyakurel
She took a better approach


[8/11/2023 1:34 PM] prabipyakurel

What did she do, now I’m curious


[8/11/2023 1:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Well they had a few problems, and I knew the dude, he was an okay person. They were going on and off and they had took a break for a while but like got together again a few weeks for prom because they got tickets together. She was happy and they were matching and I was giving all of my wishes to them. But like after prom, she went onto his insta and he had pictures with this other girl and they were hugging and kissing and stuff. She FOUND OUT, and he was with the other girl and still decided to go to prom with her.


[8/11/2023 1:37 PM] prabipyakurel
It broke her for a while, but now she is going better and we call convinced her he was an ass


[8/11/2023 1:39 PM] sskarz

[8/12/2023 2:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Nothing, actually putting away the lehengas and dresses I got from nepal from yesterday


[8/12/2023 2:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally I put it in my parents bedroom because I was too tired last night and my dad will give me the death state if he comes home and still finds it there


[8/12/2023 2:29 PM] sskarz
lmao my sister got in trouble like a few days ago because she left dresses and lehengas in our parent's room 💀


[8/12/2023 2:29 PM] prabipyakurel
I be doing that because I cant have it in my room, i need clean and peace to sleep


[8/12/2023 2:29 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/12/2023 10:02 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/12/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz

[8/12/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz

[8/12/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[8/12/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel

I wouldn't say fully, but I mean I have to go, and it will hopefully get better as I adjust and get used to coming back every once in a while.


[8/13/2023 10:16 AM] prabipyakurel
Yep in 2 days


[8/13/2023 10:16 AM] sskarz

did you ever get your classes situation sorted out?


[8/13/2023 10:21 AM] prabipyakurel
Um no, every class that I check to switch to that also fufills the requirement has like all the discussion classes waitlisted already.


[8/13/2023 10:22 AM] prabipyakurel
And I checked in with senior and juniors there and they said that I should be fine, maybe extra reading or essays, but other than that I think its okay.

[8/13/2023 10:23 AM] prabipyakurel
Yep, she said to filter it out and keep looking but I have those classes set with no time conflicts and I am not gonna put myself through that again.


[8/13/2023 10:24 AM] prabipyakurel
But I checked professor rating and made a list of how they all are and what to expect.


[8/13/2023 10:24 AM] prabipyakurel
Nothing too scary


[8/13/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
ok good


[8/13/2023 10:25 AM] sskarz
what was the lowest rating on a professor that you have?


[8/13/2023 10:25 AM] prabipyakurel
English 117: Joshua Gang
Long lectures
Improve writing skills by a lot
Strict grading; tough rubric
Light workload and small essays
Discussions
History 124b: Daniel Kelly
Lectures and teaching styles are really good.
Grades based on 2 open note essay and one essay for finals. 
Able to read 100 pg per week
Seminars
Lot of WRITING
Sociology 127: Edwin Lin
3-4 low-stakes quizzes, 3 project assignments, and 1 take-home final.
MCQs (2) are open notes
70% and up on quiz is 100%
Math 16A
Review sheets are harder than exam
Weekly quizzes
Curves grades reasonably 
Study on your own from book/ not good at lecturing
Office hours everyday; Replies fast


[8/13/2023 10:26 AM] prabipyakurel
Maybe math, indian dude, stritct , its weird but the one non upper division course seems the most difficult rn.


[8/13/2023 10:27 AM] sskarz

[8/13/2023 10:28 AM] prabipyakurel
It seems boring, but asl long as I have the book and am able to take notes, I can get through it.


[8/13/2023 10:28 AM] prabipyakurel
Like like the history class in high school, like 6 pages of notes per night.


[8/13/2023 10:29 AM] sskarz
god damn


[8/13/2023 10:30 AM] prabipyakurel
And history is essay, I love essays, they better than MCQs


[8/13/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
i was supposed to take a history class this semester but i didn't because all of the professors had like 2 star reviews


[8/13/2023 10:30 AM] prabipyakurel

[8/13/2023 10:30 AM] sskarz
i might have to take it at PCC or something so i can avoid those guys 😭


[8/13/2023 10:31 AM] prabipyakurel
I mean I doubt the professor will go deeply into 100 students essays, open notes too


[8/13/2023 10:31 AM] prabipyakurel
Can you do that?


[8/13/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz
yeah berkeley professors ain't got time for all that


[8/13/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz
yup


[8/13/2023 10:31 AM] sskarz

Sad but now kind of looking forward to it in a way. I feel like I am ready now, but at the same time it is still scary. I don't really have a word to describe how I am feeling and feel as if I am always repeating myself when you ask how I feel about leaving but its like that unknown feeling (good nor bad).

[8/15/2023 5:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol it was weird, because we dropped off our stuff into the room and went out to eat so they can leave early. And we ate momo and the nepali lady was pretty nice, got her number in case I ever needed anything. But like the moment they were walking me back to my dorm, like midway walking I looked back at my dad and started bawling. Then as I walked I was crying and people were also staring at me too. It has been that tye of day.


[8/15/2023 5:31 PM] sskarz
are you feeling any better?


[8/15/2023 5:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Um whenever I call them I freeze, you know that feeling where you will start crying when you talk and you can feel a cry starting.


[8/15/2023 5:42 PM] prabipyakurel
But yes thank you, I am doing a lot better than a few hours ago.

[8/15/2023 8:52 PM] sskarz

[8/15/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
I need to look around, but when my friend comes tomorrow, I will.


[8/15/2023 8:53 PM] sskarz
you should defiitely explore around, it'll take your mind off things and you're going to be exploring! Plus you know, it'll help you get adjusted to life on campus


[8/15/2023 8:54 PM] prabipyakurel
That’s what I am going to do, I feel like the more I think about home the more I feel sad


[8/15/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
But like when they call me, like idk it feels so sad. And my brother calls me crying and then I start crying and it ends sadly.

[8/15/2023 9:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Actually now that I think about it, it really has just been cousins or family for sleep overs


[8/15/2023 9:35 PM] sskarz

[8/16/2023 9:56 PM] sskarz
should look something like this


[8/16/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
so it plays songs based on songs you listen to


[8/16/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
and like every 3 songs you know, it'll experiment and play a song in the same genre or similar


[8/16/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel

Um not really, no, I have never actually gone deeply into any song or artist


[8/16/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I just listen to whatever


[8/16/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
Oh I gotcha


[8/16/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol a bunch of songs revolve around relationships and stuff and I just listen lol don’t really understand any of them


[8/16/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
It be like that haha


[8/16/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
Sometimes I’ll listen to a song that has the worst topic of what the artist is talking about but I still vibe to it


[8/16/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
If it sounds nice, then I listen to it tbh

{Reactions}
💯 

[8/16/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Fr though, like they will be mentioning some serious stuff in the lyrics and I am there vibing and cooking


[8/16/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz
I’ll be listening to an artist brag about drugs and money and I’m just doing random chores and vibing lol


[8/16/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz
Maybe you’ll click with an artist or genre that you really like and find that favorite song or album


[8/16/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe, I mean the only one I listen to most rn is Ariana grande


[8/16/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
But like her song lyrics aren’t deep to me


[8/16/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Just like her music


[8/16/2023 11:04 PM] sskarz
Ah


[8/16/2023 11:05 PM] sskarz
Do you like listening to songs with deep lyrics?


[8/16/2023 11:05 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/16/2023 11:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Like yea mention people who talk about things other than being heartbroken in their songs


[8/16/2023 11:08 PM] prabipyakurel

Awww but hey maybe you can find reasons to start looking for them


[8/16/2023 11:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Think about all the positive things that have happened to you so far and find songs relating to that


[8/16/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz
Yeah but like, most of the songs that I listen to are very laid back


[8/16/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz
Not really upbeat or energetic

For lunch they had food trucks so i got chicken and rice which was amazing considering I didn't have breakfast, and we went to the stadium for a pep talk thing. And now just learning math concepts in my dorm waiting for dinner to start at 6:30.


[8/17/2023 5:03 PM] sskarz

[8/18/2023 9:35 PM] sskarz

[8/18/2023 9:40 PM] prabipyakurel

so its pretty boring out here


[8/18/2023 9:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahh yea likewise, I get a bad feeling about big parties, especially late into the night


[8/18/2023 9:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Like I need a group of people that I know to be there and not worry


[8/18/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
mhmmm that's true


[8/18/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
gotta keep yourself safe


[8/18/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
some parties are a little too wild out here so I'm just not planning on attending any at all


[8/18/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea that’s a safe thing to do


[8/18/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel

For real, but like your future would be really good in my opinion, you doing all the right things. And of course you will make an impact, hell you are probably changing the lives of your students as you teach them.

Oh nah, it probably was, but I was like burning, I took off my jacket when we started


[8/19/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
If you were there walking with me on that hike, you would have left me. That is how slow I was going.

[8/19/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel

Omg so I have a story that just happened


[8/19/2023 8:50 PM] prabipyakurel
Tell me


[8/19/2023 8:50 PM] prabipyakurel
Me wants to know


[8/19/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
So rn I’m at Pasadena charging my dads car, and I was like, I’m kind of hungry so I’m gonna go to this local sandwich shop to eat something then leave right. As I’m walking down the street, I notice someone behind me walking with clanging keys to his side so I could tell how far or close he was. Like 10 minutes go by as I walk and he’s slowly walking faster towards me and I’m matching his speed to walk away from him as he’s trailing. Then I hear the keys clanging a lot more and I hear fast footsteps behind me, so I literally stepped to my right closer to the street and I see him with his shoulder front, going right where I was walking like his plan was to tackle me. He screams “ESE, DO YOU FUCKING SPEAK ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER” and I glance at him before I start running the other way, and getting the dial for 911 ready. And then after about 20 seconds of running as hard as I could, I look behind me and he was long gone.


[8/19/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
If I hadn’t dodged to the side, he was planning to tackle me to the ground like a psycho


[8/19/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
So I walked back to my car and now I’m here


[8/19/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
Wild wild experience


[8/19/2023 8:55 PM] sskarz
He was on some shit for sure


[8/19/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg first of all, that’s scary and crazy, hope you are okay.


[8/19/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
He probably was on something


[8/19/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Jeez, yea im glad you ran.


[8/19/2023 8:56 PM] sskarz
Yeah I had no idea if he had some kind of weapon so I just ran for it


[8/19/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
That must have scared you, yea be careful next time, maybe don’t go out at night like that alone too much.


[8/19/2023 8:56 PM] sskarz
I was about to reach the local shop too 😭


[8/19/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe he did who knows, yea no that scared me all the way over here.

[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
Oh nah I ran back to my car


[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
I’ll just drive there instead


[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] prabipyakurel
No don’t drive there, lol drive somewhere else


[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
hmmm probably a better idea


[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe back home and eat whatever is in the pantry


[8/19/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
Mmm I would but my dad said he would pay for dinner sooooooo


[8/19/2023 8:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Was he with you


[8/19/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz
Nope, he sent me to go charge his car at a charging network


[8/19/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz
Just me here


[8/19/2023 8:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh my, yea be careful out there, crazy people walking around rn

[8/19/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz

[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh I see, but  yea stay in the car, and this happened like a short while ago?


[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
Literally 5 mins ago


[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz

[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
wild


[8/19/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Yikes, yea if  you didn’t notice, he would have probably done something


[8/19/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
Gotta stay aware of all of your surroundings all senses


[8/19/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
All the time


[8/19/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally, this is why I am scared to wander out alone


[8/19/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
If you ever have to, bring pepper spray or some defense


[8/19/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
I don’t have any self defense than calling 911


[8/19/2023 9:02 PM] prabipyakurel
I should probably get myself pepper spray


[8/19/2023 9:02 PM] sskarz
Yes you definitely should


[8/19/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm for sure, lol I always afraid someone will ask me something and like take me away.


[8/19/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
Sometimes 911 takes too long and you need to defend yourself in that moment


[8/19/2023 9:03 PM] sskarz
Me too, but sometimes I think about how I can take them on and my odds of winning 💀


[8/19/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
No no, please do not ever try that, run to someone, don’t take them on


[8/19/2023 9:04 PM] sskarz
No no I won’t but yk, as a guy I think about these things lol


[8/19/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Better to get help or defend yourself and run

[8/19/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
No matter how strong you are (and how many times you go to the gym), run, and keep running.

The gym gains about to come in clutch 😂


[8/19/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/19/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/19/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
Are you required to attend?


[8/19/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/20/2023 2:15 PM] sskarz
woahhhhh


[8/20/2023 2:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Don’t really understand, but I am trying based on what I know


[8/20/2023 2:16 PM] sskarz
so basically one team has to hit the ball and run, the other team has to catch that ball and get their team out


[8/20/2023 2:16 PM] sskarz
if a person runs the entire field, they score a point for the team


[8/20/2023 2:16 PM] prabipyakurel
No I know that 😂


[8/20/2023 2:16 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
that would be insane


[8/20/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Dude fafsa and Pell grant got me absolutely nothing like prob 2,000 max, the rest were grants and cal grants and random scholarships


[8/20/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel
How much do you pay yearly?


[8/20/2023 9:59 PM] sskarz
about 6k


[8/20/2023 9:59 PM] prabipyakurel
If you want to share, it’s okay if you don’t.

[8/20/2023 9:59 PM] prabipyakurel
That is not bad


[8/20/2023 9:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Is that everything included?


[8/20/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
Well that’s just tuition 💀


[8/20/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
But since I’m doing my integrated masters program, there’s no added tuition with that


[8/20/2023 10:01 PM] sskarz
So I get both degrees with a year extra and no extra cost than if I just did 5 years for a bachelors


[8/20/2023 10:01 PM] sskarz
To be honest, I just want to live my life after college debt free and *mostly* done with formal education


[8/20/2023 10:01 PM] sskarz
Which is exactly why I went with the program that I did


[8/20/2023 10:02 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea that sounds like a great plan honestly, yea you got this. Yea I can’t wait to be done with bachelors and go to law school.


[8/20/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
How many years at law school?


[8/20/2023 10:02 PM] prabipyakurel
3


[8/20/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
Dangggg


[8/20/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz
You’re in it for the long run haha


[8/20/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz
That’s 7 years of straight education (assuming you don’t take a break year)


[8/20/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Nope no breaks


[8/20/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
I will take a break after I graduate the last one


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
I respect that, but do keep in mind that if it ever gets to an extreme level of stress and bad things, always an option


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
And after law school it’s the Bar exam right?


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] prabipyakurel
You gotta pass that, then get sworn in to the state


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
Damn


[8/20/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
Yeah that’s as far as my knowledge of becoming a lawyer goes lol


[8/20/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
No you are correct


[8/20/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
There was a time in my life where I seriously considered becoming a lawyer, and that was solely due to the fact that I really liked debate class


[8/20/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
Then I learned about all that and I’m ngl, I don’t have the patience 😂


[8/20/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Aww, I mean you can be an IT guy and a lawyer


[8/20/2023 10:06 PM] sskarz
The way I would lose all my cases for my clients and get kicked out of a law firm all within the first week


[8/20/2023 10:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Well if you ever consider it, we will be in it together, would be fun 😊


[8/20/2023 10:06 PM] prabipyakurel
No losing cases won’t kick you out


[8/20/2023 10:07 PM] sskarz
Sorry, I don’t have the mental capacity for that 😵‍💫


[8/20/2023 10:07 PM] sskarz
But I’ll be cheering you on as you go on your journey :)

[8/20/2023 10:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol it’s alright, honestly speaking sometimes I take on so much more that I can handle and end up forgetting about my mental state in the process. Yea and it scares me when I think about my future sometimes. Like I feel like I will mess up somewhere and end up doing something wrong. Sorry lol that was a long response.


[8/20/2023 10:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks!


[8/20/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz
Hey no you’re fine, I like when you can lay out your thoughts. And don’t worry, I think about that all the time too. It’s scary and feels like life is going to screw you up somewhere, or maybe even you’ll screw it up somehow. But as long as you remember that you’re in control of your own future and whatever goals your chasing, you will always think first before every move you make, and it’ll be easier to avoid the mistakes along the way. Trust me, you’ll make mistakes and you’ll think it’s the end of the world. Been there, done that, over it. It’s never over, and the mental battle to think like that is the hardest. In time, you’ll see your progress as a college student and you’ll see where you could’ve done better. Absolutely you will. But it’s important to keep going, having learned from your mistakes and always improving

Keep your mental state in check too! Make sure you’re content with how you’re living your life and if not, make changes as soon as possible before you get burnt out

Not just the summer, meeting you and getting to know you more has been one of my highlights of 2023.


[8/20/2023 10:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Right, actually we probably would not have started taking like this if you had net, but I am really glad you did.


[8/20/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
Me as a person? As one of your highlights? I’m gonna need that framed 😂


[8/20/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes literally you as a person. What can I say, you are just amazing.


[8/20/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
But in all seriousness, thanks for brightening my days, it really warms my heart when I get to talk to you and not feel pressured to be something that I don’t need to be.

[8/20/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
Well it would turn the adjective into an active present verb..?


[8/20/2023 10:41 PM] sskarz
Idk I’m speaking as if I’m trying to answer a question on the SAT about adverbs and adjectives


[8/20/2023 10:41 PM] sskarz
You didn’t see that


[8/20/2023 10:42 PM] prabipyakurel

Scarface
Sand


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
That’s ordered from most common to least


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
I’m gonna create a new one for you


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
idk how Scarface came to be but some people legitimately refer to me as that


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Give me a few days


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
Oh boy


[8/20/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Idk if that is meant to be in a mean way or a funny way but damn


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
Funny because they relate it to the scar on my face lol


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
And they also can’t say sanskar right


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Hahahaha


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
It can’t be that hard 😭


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
People be getting my name wrong all the time and it’s so simple too


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
How do people mess up your name 💀


[8/20/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s not, it’s literally a Nepali word that means good moral and ethics


[8/20/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz
The starbucks on campus has some employees that know me because I’ve been there with friends many times


[8/20/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz
And idk why, but every time I order there, even with my friends, I’ll get a heart drawn on my cup, but my friends wouldn’t


[8/20/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz
Still trying to get that figured out 🤔


[8/20/2023 10:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Is the barista a girl?


[8/20/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
They rotate baristas like everyday


[8/20/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
So everyday it’s new, but I swear I get it every time without fail


[8/20/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
No clue

Oh, huh, maybe they have like a favorite customer wall with your name on it


[8/20/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
They know my drinks be bussin


[8/20/2023 10:55 PM] sskarz
when it comes to Starbucks, I’ve got lists of drinks for certain moods


[8/20/2023 10:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Either that or you the special one with the longest list of ingredients in a drink so they draw a heart.


[8/20/2023 10:55 PM] sskarz
Similar to my Spotify playlists lol


[8/20/2023 10:55 PM] sskarz
Hey hey mine is certainly not that bad 💀


[8/20/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz
And if it’s a long list item, I’ll order it online so I don’t have to stand there like an imbecile and telling them line by line


[8/20/2023 10:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Jk Jk, lol you are probably really nice to them, it’s probably why


[8/20/2023 10:56 PM] prabipyakurel
Imagine, that person behind you will give you the bombastic side eye

Lol it’s fine, we all got our taste. But damn, nah those baristas all got a crush on you or something.


[8/20/2023 11:06 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/20/2023 11:08 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz
I’m literally in so much pain


[8/20/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh the face down things, I swear the most comfortable position


[8/20/2023 11:12 PM] sskarz
Is that how you sleep regularly?


[8/20/2023 11:12 PM] prabipyakurel
The grinding never stops, am I right? 🤭


[8/20/2023 11:12 PM] sskarz
I’m more of a baby fetal position sleeper myself 🧐


[8/20/2023 11:13 PM] sskarz
**in agony** mhmmm yep


[8/20/2023 11:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I sleep in that baby fetal position too, that is the way I sleep, but when you need a nap and are tired, the face down feels so good.


[8/20/2023 11:14 PM] sskarz
Oh the face down with the nap combo is unbeaten


[8/20/2023 11:14 PM] sskarz
That’s like you restart your brain type nap


[8/20/2023 11:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey it’s okay to skip a day, remember to give your body a break too.


[8/20/2023 11:14 PM] sskarz
Yeah I need my body to break

[8/20/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz
Saaaaaame


[8/20/2023 11:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it will probably rain hard tomorrow, leave it


[8/20/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Exactly


[8/20/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:17 PM] prabipyakurel
No like it happens fast and then I wake up all scared and when I fall asleep it’s another one


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
Like that was connected from other nightmares and also just waking up in between each one


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
Yup exactly like that


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
I never have good dreams 💀


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
That happens so much


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
Best I got is skipping to the next morning


[8/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/20/2023 11:21 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/20/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
Yeah


[8/20/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
Odd I know


[8/20/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
But the feeling of being nowhere and it’s just peaceful


[8/20/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
Idk, it just makes me very relaxed and happy


[8/20/2023 11:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it sounds peaceful


[8/20/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
Like nothing is bugging me and I could just stay like that forever

But it rarely happens


[8/20/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
Yeah unfortunately


[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
I hope when I die, I can live out the afterlife like that


[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Aye aye, no we don’t talk about death, we got years to live.


[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] prabipyakurel
And who knows what that is like.


[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
Hahaha yeah yeah I know, just talking philosophically

[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
I mean


[8/20/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
To be honest


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] sskarz
I’d be happy knowing that after life there is nothing


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea probably


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] sskarz
And you’re just in a state of nothingness


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] sskarz
Okay you know what bugs me


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] sskarz
Like if you really think about it, you only exist because of how life is, no clue before or what’s after it right


[8/20/2023 11:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea


[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
Like when we eventually die, is it just back to nothingness? And then what?


[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
Weird to think about


[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
I’m not really spiritual or anything so

[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] prabipyakurel
It is weird to think about, but like yea it is a questionable matter.


[8/20/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
I wish I could know


[8/20/2023 11:26 PM] sskarz
Shame I’d have to die to know


[8/20/2023 11:26 PM] sskarz
Last thing on the bucket list, before I kick the bucket


[8/20/2023 11:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Watch me get hit by a bus tomorrow, dw I will let you know 😂

[8/20/2023 11:27 PM] sskarz
It really is…


[8/20/2023 11:27 PM] sskarz
Okay, so


[8/20/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now


[8/20/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz
And promise that you won’t tell anyone what I’m about to tell you


[8/20/2023 11:28 PM] prabipyakurel
You have my word, I promise.


[8/20/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz
So recently, a couple of weeks ago, my dad went to get a colonoscopy. And long story short, the doctor said that a tumor was about to grow inside his body, and he’s lucky to be alive. His previous doctor had actually found it before it started growing and removed it, and he said to him that he’d be dead in a year, which meant that he would’ve died by now if it wasn’t removed a year ago.


[8/20/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz
And it got me in a really… really depressed state for a couple days


[8/20/2023 11:31 PM] sskarz
It made me realize how much my life would’ve crumbled to pieces knowing in a different reality, I would’ve lost my dad this year


[8/20/2023 11:31 PM] sskarz
So I think partly due to that, I’ve been pushing myself to my limits and doing everything I can to better myself


[8/20/2023 11:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg that’s scary to think about, and I am happy that he is here with everyone. But hey he is safe now dw, and I pray that he will continue to have the best health. Don’t ever think about that too much, you are okay, you keep doing you.


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
Yeah, it got me thinking about how I should spend my time


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
We only have so much of it


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
And life can change in an instant


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea no that scared me, and don’t worry I won’t tell anyone.


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Okay so I am going to share something similar, and can you not tell anyone either.


[8/20/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz

[8/20/2023 11:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Okay so, your dad got it like a couple weeks ago but my dad has his colonoscopy tomorrow. And today he has just been drinking liquids  and stuff to get ready and I was literally talking to them before texting you, but yea I am hoping that his test goes smoothly tomorrow and we get good results.

The problem do be that my room heats up real quick


[8/20/2023 11:57 PM] sskarz
And the only way I get cold air rn is from the window


[8/20/2023 11:57 PM] sskarz

Earlier when we were talking, my power went out


[8/20/2023 11:58 PM] sskarz

[8/21/2023 12:01 AM] sskarz
That’s the problem with afternoon naps


[8/21/2023 12:01 AM] sskarz
So hard to sleep later


[8/21/2023 12:01 AM] prabipyakurel
I try to avoid them


[8/21/2023 12:02 AM] prabipyakurel
The naps, not roommates 😂

[8/21/2023 12:04 AM] sskarz
I swear it’s not visually impactful, and even the sound isn’t accurate


[8/21/2023 12:04 AM] sskarz
It’s like howling winds


[8/21/2023 12:04 AM] prabipyakurel
Wow it’s like stormy stormy out there


[8/21/2023 12:04 AM] prabipyakurel
And WHY IS THE WINDOW STILL OPEN???


[8/21/2023 12:04 AM] sskarz
I NEED THE COLD AIR OTHERWISE I WILL DIE OF HEAT 💀

[8/21/2023 12:05 AM] prabipyakurel
Or if you have to leave like an inch or 2 open


[8/21/2023 12:06 AM] prabipyakurel
Not the entire thing


[8/21/2023 12:06 AM] sskarz
Eh I’ll compromise


[8/21/2023 12:06 AM] prabipyakurel
You do you, but stay safe, lol it sounds  wild out there


[8/21/2023 12:06 AM] sskarz

[8/21/2023 12:06 AM] sskarz
Do you remember the last time that it hailed in LA?


[8/21/2023 12:07 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea I remember


[8/21/2023 12:07 AM] prabipyakurel
I wanted to go out


[8/21/2023 12:07 AM] sskarz
You would get hit by many tiny ice rocks


[8/21/2023 12:07 AM] prabipyakurel
But then I would bring the water in so I was denied to do so


[8/21/2023 12:07 AM] prabipyakurel
Meh


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] sskarz
Fair enough lol


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] sskarz
I’ve only seen hail in LA like 3 times in my entire lifetime


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] sskarz
And I thought that’s as wild as weather could get


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea but the most recent one was kinda crazy


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] sskarz
Oh yeah


[8/21/2023 12:08 AM] sskarz
Definitely was the strongest from what I remember of the other 2


[8/21/2023 12:09 AM] prabipyakurel
For sure


[8/21/2023 12:09 AM] prabipyakurel
You aren’t sleepy yet?

[8/21/2023 2:29 PM] sskarz
Somehow yeah, it was howling loud but I think I was just so tired my body fully shut down


[8/21/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
It’s a nice and bright day now


[8/21/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
No rain in sight anymore


[8/21/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea, ita probably because you had a long day yesterday and we were talking till like past 12


[8/21/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/21/2023 2:31 PM] sskarz

You went today too, wow, you werent tired or anything


[8/21/2023 2:32 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah I was exhausted, and I almost cancelled on my friend but it’s those times that are critical to stay disciplined


[8/21/2023 2:32 PM] sskarz
I pushed so much weight today, I beat a lot of my personal records


[8/21/2023 2:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, your muscles are probably screaming again lol. But yea like if you dont feel up to it, its alright to tell your friends no, I am sure they understand.


[8/21/2023 2:33 PM] sskarz

[8/21/2023 2:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Well I got a 15 page paper to read to prepare for my classes on thrusday but like my head hurts a lot and I am trying my best to read and take notes. I think I will do half today and half tomorrow because I have time, so I dont burn myself out in the process.


[8/21/2023 2:37 PM] sskarz
Take it a step at a time, I agree you shouldn’t push yourself when you’re having headaches, it’ll just make it worse


[8/21/2023 2:38 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/21/2023 2:39 PM] sskarz

[8/21/2023 2:57 PM] sskarz
ohhhhhh ok ok so


[8/21/2023 2:57 PM] sskarz
my advice


[8/21/2023 2:57 PM] sskarz
don't ever ever listen to a sales person talk about the computers or laptops they sell


[8/21/2023 2:57 PM] sskarz
they just say a bunch of BS that sounds good, but you will probably pay more for a machine than for what its worth


[8/21/2023 2:57 PM] sskarz
if you ever need a recommendation on any tech, let me know and i can find a proper deal on something


[8/21/2023 2:58 PM] sskarz
in terms of price to performance


[8/21/2023 2:58 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/21/2023 2:59 PM] sskarz
makes me feel good when my friends/family can avoid all the bs that costco employees will tell you about tech


[8/21/2023 2:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice, see you know a while back when you said if your work will have any impact, look it has an impact on your friends computer choice, lol keep doing what you are doing.

[8/21/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Nope, I expect just good grades from such an amazinger person 😂


[8/21/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey look at you, that’s pretty good.


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
it was just an easy professor back then


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
thank goodness i have no more "math" classes


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
tho one of my compsci classes is all theory, and theory always means math :/


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh you so lucky


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
you have one?


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
But like it’s comp sci, you are fine.


[8/21/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
i be telling myself that too lmao


[8/21/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Yep, got math 16 that comes with a second part math 16b, and then because I am an Econ major one of the prerequisite is stats too and other Econ classes which mean math included 😭


[8/21/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
No fr, just focus and you will get good grades.


[8/21/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
i was like metro included? hahaha


[8/21/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
damn


[8/21/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
You didn’t see anything


[8/21/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
honestly i've never took a stats class ever


[8/21/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
i only ever took calculus


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea got calculus this year with no previous calc knowledge


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
The stress level about to go through the roof


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
ohhhhhhh


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
calculus 1?


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Stats is fun, I have done the coding version of stats in data science but seems pretty interesting


[8/21/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
or precalc


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea calc 1


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
omg you're beyond fine


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
omg


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
kms


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
anyway


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
you will be fine


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
calculus 1 is like one of the easiest math courses of all time


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
no lie


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol you are slowly becoming me 😂


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
precalculus was harder, algebra 2 was harder


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
calc 1 is a joke


[8/21/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Is it because you are good at math?


[8/21/2023 9:15 PM] prabipyakurel
I love algebra, it’s amazing


[8/21/2023 9:15 PM] sskarz
no no if you saw my math, i would get the answer Africa in a math test

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/21/2023 9:15 PM] sskarz
calculus is like, you get to skip all the algebra and get the answer by converting numbers


[8/21/2023 9:15 PM] sskarz
that's about it


[8/21/2023 9:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh and you have taken it before right?


[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
i've taken precalc, calc 1, calc 2, and calc 3


[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
calc 1 is by far the easiest


[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
and calc 3 is the hardest


[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn, alright, imma be messaging you if I got problems

{Reactions}
💯 

[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
i'll be able to help you in the beginning, but my memory may be foggy


[8/21/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
derivatives are pretty easy to figure out anyways


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s alright lol, I am not gonna disturb you, I was messing with you, you got classes and stuff too.


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
I have been teaching myself topics


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Like from YouTube videos


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Just to get a head start


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
precalc: its algebra, not calc
calc 1: convert numbers, easy
calc 2: convert the numbers, but what if they were on a graph
calc 3: you put them on the graph, but now the graph is 3D


[8/21/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
there's the summary of each lol


[8/21/2023 9:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhh I see, okay maybe I don’t need to freak out about this

[8/21/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz

[8/21/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
idk how to explain it


[8/21/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
makes me feel better


[8/21/2023 9:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Um yea fasting is good, but you need to eat to have energy for the next day too, just do it safely.


[8/21/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
and also its part of my diet for a couple days


[8/21/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
of course!


[8/21/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahh, I should probably start like some type of diet, I just randomly eat anything when I feel like it. Probably why I get sick so easily lol


[8/21/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
try to get most of your nutrients everyday, that's what's most important


[8/21/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
you don't have to do anything drastic


[8/21/2023 9:23 PM] sskarz
i do it because i want to look like chris hemsworth in a year 😂


[8/21/2023 9:23 PM] prabipyakurel

Not sure, honestly gonna have to take a test


[8/21/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel
I will show you tomorrow when I do it, but when I type, I type really fast but have to look down at the keyboard


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Like my dad used to teach me how to do it without looking down, but I don’t know how to still


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
oooh bet, typing is a real skill in these times


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
oh the proper way?


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
it takes time to learn how to do it without looking


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm, I am sure yours is really good though


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] prabipyakurel
You can probably do the one without looking I assume


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
well back in middle school, they put me in a compsci class that made me learn proper typing and made me practice for 2 years straight


[8/21/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
yeah, it took me a while but i got it down


[8/21/2023 9:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, that’s cool.


[8/21/2023 9:35 PM] prabipyakurel
You have been doing it for a while so I am not surprised by what you can do.

[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
the teacher gave me a good grade out of pity of me trying 💀


[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
infinitely better than me


[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Awwwww lol that’s so adorable, what did you draw that was that bad?


[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
it was an art class back in high school


[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Nope, I am sure you draw better trust me, I get excited when I can draw anything better than a stick figure


[8/21/2023 9:57 PM] sskarz
and i used to stay in that class through lunch time and work on drawing skills really hard with the teacher giving me tips and stuff


[8/21/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
and i guess they recognized the effort i put in and still gave me a decent grading just from proof of me trying


[8/21/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
never again will i take an arts class 😂


[8/21/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey, you spent time and tried, you should get decent grades.


[8/21/2023 9:58 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/21/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I think it can be hard sometimes and I don’t know how it feels, but sometimes it’s okay, she is trying her best and I am sure she wants to be around you too, but give it time, it’s alright.


[8/21/2023 10:03 PM] sskarz

I remember when I first sent you that discord friend request, I was like he probably won’t like me or walk to me normally and find me weird but the more we talk the more it makes me realize how great of a person you are.


[8/21/2023 11:21 PM] prabipyakurel
I fr thought that you already found me so weird when we met at bijesh house that one time


[8/21/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 3:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice, my day went by smooth, woke up and took a shower and felt so much better. Attended an info session for upcoming Econ majors and went to check out where my math class is taking place. I also checked out the recreation facility and it was so big.


[8/22/2023 3:55 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[8/22/2023 3:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Doesn’t your class go up to 4 or 3:45 on tuesdays?


[8/22/2023 3:59 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 3:59 PM] sskarz
But I finished all the work early so I left


[8/22/2023 4:00 PM] sskarz
Oooh did you get to take pics of the recreation facility?


[8/22/2023 4:00 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 4:00 PM] prabipyakurel
I took one lol, there were so many BOYSSSSS


[8/22/2023 4:00 PM] prabipyakurel
I literally walked in, looked around and left lol


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah, many professors will allow you to just leave if you finished the lecture and the work associated with it


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] sskarz
So for me, lecture was 2 to 3 then 3 to 4 is the workshop


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] sskarz
I finished in 20 mins and left


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see, damn, the more you know.


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] prabipyakurel
I fr thought you had to stay till class ended


[8/22/2023 4:01 PM] sskarz
Had to be that guy that rushes the work during lecture, and leaves early during workshop 😂


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] sskarz
Hey idk how it works with you guys and your major, but for me at least yeah


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh, you that one kid that is like, i dont care professor, imma do my thing.


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] sskarz
Plus I know most of the professors and they know me, so they don’t really care


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] sskarz
Yeah lol


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Well thats good tho, you can just do work and leave


[8/22/2023 4:02 PM] sskarz
Mhmmm makes my life easy

[8/22/2023 4:05 PM] prabipyakurel

But no gym today


[8/22/2023 4:05 PM] sskarz
Gotta let myself heal for tomorrow


[8/22/2023 4:06 PM] sskarz
Rest days are very important yk, people that go everyday of the week compared to 6 days a week and a rest day, the latter will do better in performance and muscle gains


[8/22/2023 4:06 PM] sskarz
Fatigue builds up fast and impacts you easily in future workouts if you don’t take rest days


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] prabipyakurel
*rest days


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] sskarz
My god


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] sskarz
Apple doesn’t want me to say rest 😭


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] prabipyakurel
But yea, always remember to give yourself time too.


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] sskarz
It’s killing me lol


[8/22/2023 4:07 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 4:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea honeslty I am freaking out, I only got math on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and its scary


[8/22/2023 4:10 PM] sskarz
Well at least the first day is mostly going to be syllabus related so you can get adjusted


[8/22/2023 4:10 PM] sskarz
Don’t freak out, you’re going to do just fine

[8/22/2023 4:11 PM] sskarz
Hahaha nah syllabus always comes first… usually


[8/22/2023 4:11 PM] sskarz
Or they might do review worst case


[8/22/2023 4:12 PM] sskarz
they won’t just jump straight into it thinking you know all the derivatives and anti derivatives and what not


[8/22/2023 4:12 PM] sskarz
So trust me, you’ll do fine. Plus I bet you catch on easily


[8/22/2023 4:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea maybe, it makes sense to start with the syllabus.


[8/22/2023 4:12 PM] sskarz
Mhmm


[8/22/2023 4:12 PM] prabipyakurel
This is college, I dont know anything lol


[8/22/2023 4:13 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 6:22 PM] prabipyakurel
You know this one time I set my friends up and the just stopped talking to each other for the next week


[8/22/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
hahaha no no you're good, im not judging at all or anything


[8/22/2023 6:23 PM] sskarz
oh? what happened?


[8/22/2023 6:24 PM] prabipyakurel
So they liked each other and it was pretty obvious in the group chat, but then i think after they confronted each other (me and my other friend tony were in a table with them) it got weird and I talk to both and they were both sharing what happened in those conversation, Clearly somthing didnt go right, so I decided to be a little therapist and help, but they didnt wanna do anything to fix it, now if they are just friends


[8/22/2023 6:25 PM] prabipyakurel
I was sitting on the fence taking on both sides and then it just randomly ended somehow


[8/22/2023 6:26 PM] sskarz
oh that is very interesting


[8/22/2023 6:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea one of the interesting ones for sure


[8/22/2023 6:26 PM] prabipyakurel
and I talk to both and they talk in group chat so we good


[8/22/2023 6:27 PM] sskarz
well even if someone likes someone, no guarantee that they will like being around them closer


[8/22/2023 6:27 PM] sskarz
sometimes it just doesn't work out


[8/22/2023 6:27 PM] sskarz
but hey, glad they're still friends


[8/22/2023 6:27 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 6:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats true tho


[8/22/2023 6:28 PM] sskarz
yeah i've seen that happen a couple of times with some of my friends


[8/22/2023 6:29 PM] sskarz
similar story, one of my own friends got setup with a friend of a friend, and they talked for like 3 weeks and then just stopped


[8/22/2023 6:29 PM] sskarz
idk what happened but they just called it there and like, fair enough


[8/22/2023 6:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I mean you got to wait till you find the one sometimes


[8/22/2023 6:30 PM] prabipyakurel
But like I am the last person to be giving any sort of relationship advice, yet I will still be like, nah dont like him, get rid of him 😂


[8/22/2023 6:30 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 6:30 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 6:31 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 6:32 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 7:31 PM] sskarz
how's the other food tasting like?


[8/22/2023 7:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Well the naan is actually fire, the dal could use some work, and the tandoori chicken can have some more masala but it’s good for dining hall food.


[8/22/2023 7:33 PM] sskarz
oh yeah naan is added to the list of foods you just can't mess up lol


[8/22/2023 7:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Ooo never


[8/22/2023 7:33 PM] prabipyakurel
It is just amazing

But like won’t you get hungry


[8/22/2023 7:35 PM] sskarz
nope im not hungry at all


[8/22/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
you know a cool thing about the body


[8/22/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
alot of the time you feel hungry, almost half the time its due to the fact that you're just dehydrated


[8/22/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
and a good  way of finding out which one it is, is literally just drinking water when you're hungry


[8/22/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
if you are, then you need food. if not, then you just needed water in the system


[8/22/2023 7:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Huh that’s cool, you know I still need to get into the habit of drinking water


[8/22/2023 7:37 PM] prabipyakurel
I fear that one day I will actually be extremely dehydrated and like fall


[8/22/2023 7:37 PM] sskarz
something that helped me is keeping my water bottle in sight at all times


[8/22/2023 7:38 PM] sskarz
hey now, take your water bottle with you if you can


[8/22/2023 7:38 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 7:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I can’t tell you how many time my family has told me to drink water, like over the weekend I used to drink water after breakfast and lunch and that would be it


[8/22/2023 7:39 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
but its like any other class


[8/22/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
yea i am not ready


[8/22/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
why do you feel so?


[8/22/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
what part of you isn't ready?


[8/22/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
I dont know why i feel that way, but like no part of me is ready, I already feel like I am behind and messing up.


[8/22/2023 9:15 PM] sskarz
you haven't even started! you can't even mess up even if you wanted to, you can't even fall behind if it hasn't started.
Imagine everyone else right now, in your freshman class. Do you think they are all going to know the entire class material, or even be expected to? Of course not! It's the same thing, no one is going to expect you to know the entire class course work and be able to pass calc 1 in a week. And that's okay!!!! It's okay to not know everything right from the beginning. That doesn't mean you're going to fall behind at all. Even if you knew everything, would it seriously change anything? The nervousness, the stress, the feeling of not being able to perform under pressure of work and time management is all still going to be there. And it seems scary, you know I just listed all of those things and I probably made you feel even worse. But believe me when I say, you're not expected to know everything. I know you well enough to say that you won't just be more than fine, but you're going to excel. You're going to be the best person in that classroom, in that subject, and everyone will see you as the smart kid in class! You are nothing short of incredible potential, you've proved it to not just me, but everyone.
Don't let your fears taunt or control you, remember you are either your biggest ally, or the worst enemy. And what changes from an enemy to ally, is a change of perspective. 
So take this change of perspective, the perspective of being okay with going into something knowing nothing, but knowing that you will know more each day to conquer the next challenge.

I can guarantee you that after a week, you will slowly adapt to this new style of learning, living, and everything in between. It's just life, it's how we live everyday. We all don't know what we're going to do at every moment of the next day, no one does. There's no way to prepare for such a thing if you really think about it. Yeah you can plan it out, but will you know every step you take, every breath that you take, the movement of your eyes. There are so many things to keep in mind, and it starts to become overwhelming.
The perspective of being okay when in the dark, when you're just lost, it's helped me too. It helps you be okay even when times, it all just looks so daunting


[8/22/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
Maybe for you it might be just the complete opposite of everything I've said, if that's the case then feel free to tell me and yell at me and everything. But odds are, you will be okay! More than that, you will thrive. Keep that in your mental as you go and learn tomorrow, go in with the mindset of being ready to learn and take on whatever comes your way. It'll help with the anxiety and stress that follows. It won't totally leave you, but trust me when I say it really helps.


[8/22/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
I have no words for you literally you are the best person in the world. You gonna make me cry, thank you so much, I will keep your words in mind and I will go to class tomorrow with positive thoughts. I am sorry if I made you write a lot lol, you are such a beautiful soul.

[8/22/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
Awwwwww no no don't cry!! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to get that reaction from you. I want to empower you, to show you that you have what it takes to be the best, to be the one that conquers, to be so confident in your own abilities. It's hard, there's a reason why its the highest peak in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. When you reach that level, you become an unstoppable person. A person who's will can't change, who's mind can't be changed from what they want to do, and you become the best. You have what it takes, I know you do. I believe in you, and you're one of the smartest, kindest, nicest, clumsiest people I've ever known. But that makes you you, and that makes me want to uplift your spirits when you're down. So when I say that you will be the best, god damn it you're going to be the best! Put that in your own head, it may seem a little egotistical and totally not humble, but sometimes you need that fire. That confidence will help you conquer those problems that seem like brick walls. It's a crazy powerful tool that I believe in.

When I'm feeling overwhelmed, I like to think about how I didn't want to let all my efforts in life go to waste. You know, I get this feeling with basic chores sometimes, and it sounds ridiculous I know. There have been times where I've been so mentally and physically exhausted that there was nothing more than just wanting to be erased from the world for a couple days. Just so I had no responsibilities, nothing to think about, and I could ease my mind. But I can't do that, I've got a future to fight for. A future where I'm successful in life, whatever that may be. A future that my old past self would look up at and couldn't fathom the idea of being there. That's what I fight for, every single day. And it gets me through any challenge that throws itself at me.


[8/22/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
All of this strife and struggle will seem like a good memory down the road.


[8/22/2023 9:34 PM] prabipyakurel

A little bit of an ancient example, but imagine you are Sisyphus. The guy that was forced the eternal punishment of forever rolling up the boulder uphill. He never stopped, no matter how tired he got, no matter if his legs were bound to disintegrate, he kept pushing that rock up that hill


[8/22/2023 9:41 PM] sskarz

There's an album I listen to when I feel like I'm really stressed or anxious. It's called Circles by Mac Miller, and it was his last ever project. But what's so special about it is the way it feels like he speaks directly to you, in like a therapeutic sense


[8/22/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
And so I just put that album on, but not because I'm stressed or anxious, just that it's nice to hear someone talking like they're going through the same things and living through it


[8/22/2023 9:58 PM] sskarz
Idk if you could tell yet, but I have a deep connection with music and how it affects my moods and attitudes towards things. And this is one of the most powerful ones for me

[8/22/2023 9:59 PM] sskarz
It's just how I feel and exemplify my emotions


[8/22/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
It's why I collect vinyls. Albums that have either changed my life, or I've connected to on a deep level


[8/22/2023 10:01 PM] sskarz
It's how I remind myself of what music has done for me


[8/22/2023 10:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey as long as it makes you feel better and heals you, you do you, music is awesome, I love listening to random music.


[8/22/2023 10:01 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
I was just as anxious and nervous as you


[8/22/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
And I never really listened to music prior to that


[8/22/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
But it really was that thing that helped me


[8/22/2023 10:02 PM] sskarz
It just helped me deal with emotions


[8/22/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel

If I was talking to you then, I would have told you that you would have succeeded in every way possible.


[8/22/2023 10:04 PM] prabipyakurel
For sure, some music are really captivating and like you can relate to it a lot.


[8/22/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
hahaha, well honestly, this sounds weird, but I've made more progress as a person in every regard in the last 2 years, than I've ever had in my years prior to that


[8/22/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
just comparing myself to how I was when I was younger


[8/22/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz

I wish I could go back in time and show you, you wouldn't believe it


[8/22/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
What was so different about you high school years and post high school years into college?


[8/22/2023 10:05 PM] prabipyakurel
You don’t have to answer that, hope I am not being nosy


[8/22/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
no no you're not at all, again, I'm an open book


[8/22/2023 10:06 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 10:12 PM] prabipyakurel
U still there?


[8/22/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
If I could say it in one word. I'd say Perspective.
I used to be so overly negative. I hated how I looked, how I acted, how I did things, how I thought. During my middle school years, I fell into a depressive hole and it caused me to set my entire life on fire. There were times where I contemplated running away from everything and everyone, and doing worse things. For a few years, I loathed every day. The friends I talked to I couldn't care less about, the things I did and said held no weight. I was just so... like I felt as if everything was just so much higher and I felt like it was impossible to climb out of that hole yk? When you feel like you're so low, that the bottom floor is closer than getting out, so you just sink. This carried with me all the way into high school, till about Junior year of high school. I started to realize what I was doing to myself and how it also impacted those around me. It wasn't enough to fully make me realize, but it made me change slowly. Of course I couldn't share these feelings with anyone, I kept it all to myself and put on a fake smile for years on end. And then high school ended, and my life took a turn. My perspective just changed, like I just had to snap out of it. And ever since then, I've changed my entire character, my entire person, and my entire perspective of how I view life and people and family and friends and loved ones. It sounds crazy, and honestly, I haven't reflected this hard in a while, but it's true. You wouldn't have liked me if you knew who I was back then. How can you like someone that didn't like themselves.


[8/22/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
Thankfully, I'm nowhere even close to who I used to be. I'm so much happier being who I am today, than I would ever have been.


[8/22/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
I love myself to the upmost degree, and my self esteem has never ever been higher


[8/22/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
Even when I make mistakes today, I just think about the shit I've already gone and done, and it all seems so miniscule. Like nothing could compare to what those years did


[8/22/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
I know I'm really putting myself out there, and you know maybe this isn't what you wanted to hear


[8/22/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
but I want to be honest


[8/22/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
This is who I was, this is who I am today. And this is just me, all of it


[8/22/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
It's why I preach so much about optimism and perspective, because that's what got me out of all of that. Without that, I wouldn't be who I am today, not even close


[8/22/2023 10:21 PM] prabipyakurel
First of all thank you for sharing, it takes a lot to reflect on the time that has passed. And I am so sorry that you had to go through so much but you got out of it and now you are doing your best. And one thing you gotta remember is to love yourself always, I mean you always here from others but from how much I know you, you are like so amazing. And yea you might have felt like you wanted to be someone else, look different, and maybe see things differently, but you got through those things on your own and it already tells me how strong of a person you are. Thank you for sharing again, I will keep this to myself dw, I am not telling anyone. And your smile is precious, keep it on.

[8/22/2023 10:45 PM] prabipyakurel
They love barging in and being all “how long are you going to sleep” it’s 7:55 you going to be late for school, and it’s literally 6:00

[8/22/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 10:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Indian parents literally move the time


[8/22/2023 10:46 PM] prabipyakurel
But they be late to everything


[8/22/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
that's part of the reason why i love college more than high school, like i'm on my own schedule and i don't have to wake up at like 6 if i don't need to


[8/22/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 10:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey so you know how earlier you said you found someone who was worthy, can I get like a name or a hint, do I know the person or no? Just curious


[8/22/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
hmmmmmmmm


[8/22/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
well technically I've given a hint already


[8/22/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
and I'll leave it at that


[8/22/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Where, I didn’t get no hint


[8/22/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Tell me the hint again


[8/22/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
no no I did give one


[8/22/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 10:50 PM] prabipyakurel
I probably don’t even know them


[8/22/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz
I'll leave it up to interpretation


[8/22/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
who knows


[8/22/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
maybe they don't even exist in the first place?


[8/22/2023 10:51 PM] prabipyakurel
You are literally gonna make me reread 2 months worth of text to see a hint that you may or may not have said


[8/22/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
the world may never know


[8/22/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz

Hmmmm we shall see


[8/22/2023 10:52 PM] prabipyakurel
But a hint won’t hurt, lol like I said I probably won’t know who they are anyway


[8/22/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz
haha you're not getting anything more from me, I've said all I've needed to say


[8/22/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz
Unless you give me a hint, then perhaps a negotiation could be held

[8/22/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
again, technically, i've already told this information


[8/22/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
my hint to you was that i already gave a hint technically


[8/22/2023 10:58 PM] sskarz
so good luck lol


[8/22/2023 10:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe you are evil 👿


[8/22/2023 10:58 PM] sskarz
maybe I am 😈


[8/22/2023 10:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Bro there is no sort of hint that I caught on to


[8/22/2023 10:58 PM] sskarz
we could hold a negotiation for an extra hint if you drop a hint too


[8/22/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
a hint for a hint


[8/22/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 11:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn it give me another letter


[8/22/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz
well that's because I'd like for you to get some quality sleep for your big day tomorrow instead of wasting your time on trying to get a hint out of me 💀


[8/22/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 11:08 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/22/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz (pinned)
To the waves that carry
A sign was shown
A place unimaginable
And unfathomable
There in their eyes they witnessed
Witnessed with me
The letter that spelled thee


[8/22/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz
There you go


[8/22/2023 11:17 PM] sskarz
So..?


[8/22/2023 11:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Um


[8/22/2023 11:17 PM] prabipyakurel
You came up with this


[8/22/2023 11:17 PM] sskarz
Yes


[8/22/2023 11:17 PM] sskarz
I did


[8/22/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
Did you already figure it out?


[8/22/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe or maybe I am reading it wrong


[8/22/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
Well that's up to you


[8/22/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
I won't say anymore


[8/22/2023 11:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmmm


[8/22/2023 11:19 PM] prabipyakurel
“The letter that spelled thee”


[8/22/2023 11:19 PM] sskarz
What about it?


[8/22/2023 11:19 PM] prabipyakurel
None of those give me a name nothing


[8/22/2023 11:20 PM] sskarz
Well they do call these a riddle for a reason


[8/22/2023 11:20 PM] prabipyakurel
It sounds more like a poem


[8/22/2023 11:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Where is the riddle in this


[8/22/2023 11:20 PM] sskarz
well


[8/22/2023 11:20 PM] sskarz
if I told you, it would become incredibly obvious


[8/22/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
Maybe it'll click with you one day


[8/22/2023 11:21 PM] sskarz
And if it doesn't, so be it :)


[8/22/2023 11:21 PM] prabipyakurel
But why don’t you wanna share?


[8/22/2023 11:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I will figure it out somehow


[8/22/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
I've already shared it


[8/22/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
You just need to think a bit harder


[8/22/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
The poem should give you a direction


[8/22/2023 11:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Pinned a message.


[8/22/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
and technically, it points to the exact person


[8/22/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
You solve the poem, you solve this entire question


[8/22/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
I really can't give you more than that


[8/22/2023 11:23 PM] prabipyakurel
How will I know if I am right?


[8/22/2023 11:23 PM] sskarz
You'll know


[8/22/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
Think back to what I said, and perhaps you'll see something is out of place


[8/22/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
and no, I don't mean the poem


[8/22/2023 11:25 PM] sskarz
:)


[8/22/2023 11:25 PM] prabipyakurel
About what you said today?

The poem is staring and screaming the answer, and all you have to do is just... think about it


[8/22/2023 11:26 PM] sskarz
a little thinking exercise built just for you :)


[8/22/2023 11:27 PM] prabipyakurel
I read all the lines and they all sound different except one


[8/22/2023 11:27 PM] prabipyakurel
But idk if i broke it down correctly


[8/22/2023 11:27 PM] sskarz
And I can neither confirm nor deny


[8/22/2023 11:27 PM] sskarz
When you are sure, you take the leap of faith


[8/22/2023 11:28 PM] prabipyakurel
By leap of faith, you mean share the name


[8/22/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz
Do I?


[8/22/2023 11:28 PM] prabipyakurel
You are way too annoying at this point


[8/22/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz
hahahaha

[8/22/2023 11:28 PM] sskarz
I'm confident you'll figure it all out


[8/22/2023 11:29 PM] sskarz
I made it specifically for you anyway


[8/22/2023 11:29 PM] sskarz
So here's my last hint


[8/22/2023 11:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Awww


[8/22/2023 11:29 PM] sskarz
and what I've been talking about all day


[8/22/2023 11:29 PM] sskarz

[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz
Oh you figured it out?


[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I think so


[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz
How confident are you?


[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Not sure, I might just be imagining things


[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] sskarz
You could be all wrong for all you know


[8/22/2023 11:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[8/22/2023 11:31 PM] sskarz
I'm not suggesting anything, just realizing it all


[8/22/2023 11:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe a little confident


[8/22/2023 11:31 PM] prabipyakurel
I am starting to see it a little


[8/22/2023 11:31 PM] sskarz
Mhmmmm


[8/22/2023 11:32 PM] sskarz
Well once you're 100% confident, you'll know


[8/22/2023 11:32 PM] sskarz
personally, I'm really proud of that poem I made


[8/22/2023 11:32 PM] prabipyakurel
It is a really good poem


[8/22/2023 11:33 PM] prabipyakurel
I liked it


[8/22/2023 11:33 PM] sskarz
well if you realize it fully, it's kind of ingenious


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] prabipyakurel
I know, just unsure about the confidence level


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
So you haven't completely solved the poem then


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] prabipyakurel
No I have


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
Damn that was fast lol


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] prabipyakurel
There is just a part of it that I am looking at over and over again


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
What line?


[8/22/2023 11:34 PM] sskarz
if I could ask


[8/22/2023 11:35 PM] prabipyakurel
“The letter that spelled thee”


[8/22/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
Oh


[8/22/2023 11:35 PM] sskarz
Really?


[8/22/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
If you solved it, that should've been the easiest thing to figure out


[8/22/2023 11:36 PM] sskarz
Well it should've been obvious if you solved everything else


[8/22/2023 11:37 PM] prabipyakurel
I have a train of thought


[8/22/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
Glad its got you thinking


[8/22/2023 11:37 PM] sskarz
Don't be thinking about this in class though 😂


[8/22/2023 11:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah dw I am not bringing this into class


[8/22/2023 11:38 PM] prabipyakurel
You can help me by giving me the name so I can be sure and sleep in peace.

[8/22/2023 11:39 PM] sskarz
You need to be clear headed for tomorrow yk?


[8/22/2023 11:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I need to get the riddle out of my head, imma stick with the answer I have for now : )


[8/22/2023 11:40 PM] sskarz
Well once you're fully confident, you let me know


[8/22/2023 11:40 PM] sskarz
After all, you only have 1 shot


[8/22/2023 11:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmmm okay okay, yea i will let you know

[8/23/2023 8:06 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea it starts at 3, but I got the sociology reading for tomorrow, and I dont want to save it for after class (its only like 5 more pages to read really) so I think I will just do that, go do laundry if I can and eat lunch, then maybe take a short nap before getting to class.


[8/23/2023 8:06 AM] sskarz
Sounds like a solid plan


[8/23/2023 8:06 AM] prabipyakurel
the nap is a maybe, i dont wanna accidently miss my first class


[8/23/2023 8:06 AM] sskarz
Wait where do you do laundry? Is there like a public one in the dorms?


[8/23/2023 8:07 AM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:08 AM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 7:54 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice nice, well my class was kinda weird, It was about 300 students in there, that is massive first of all. And second of all, he is scaring the shit out of me, its like he makes it sounds like we will be fine but at the same time he be like "just because you do well on the quizzes does not mean you will get a good grade on the finals" and stuff like that. I mean he just went over the syllabus today, but ugh i already kinda think he gonna be that one painful professor.


[8/23/2023 7:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Also got an updated schedule

[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
Ohhhh yeah they're not trying to scare you, its true like if you did all the quizzes and got 100s, but failed the final, you might fail the class type of deal. Honestly tho, it's never been an issue like ever, so don't worry about it


[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
See, I told you they'd only go over the syllabus for the first day


[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
also 300 students? damn that must be a huge lecture hall


[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
Pinned a message.


[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
What did you change?


[8/23/2023 7:56 PM] sskarz
Oh discussions, I see that now


[8/23/2023 7:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh i see, yea because he was going on and on about how everything will be like, and he is all like, you know you might fail and you might pass.


[8/23/2023 7:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I thought it was just 100, that hall was not that big


[8/23/2023 8:00 PM] prabipyakurel
I was surprised when he said that


[8/23/2023 8:00 PM] sskarz
yeah that's pretty nuts


[8/23/2023 8:00 PM] sskarz
I'm not a fan of lecture hall type classrooms just cause its hard to ask questions directly


[8/23/2023 8:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea he was like, i dont personally take questions but for now I can.


[8/23/2023 8:01 PM] prabipyakurel
yea it will be hard to get personal help from the dude


[8/23/2023 8:02 PM] sskarz
mhmmmm, are all of your classes in lecture halls?


[8/23/2023 8:02 PM] prabipyakurel
I just had that class today


[8/23/2023 8:03 PM] prabipyakurel
I went around to check the rest of my classes after and this one class is like around the corner in this foresty area and I just couldn't go in there alone, so that is a tomorrow 5pm problem


[8/23/2023 8:04 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 8:04 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I am trying my best, i dont think i will get a heat stroke, but yes thank you I will stay hydrated


[8/23/2023 8:21 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:21 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:22 PM] prabipyakurel
No just asked the girl next to me where one piece of information was, thats it


[8/23/2023 8:22 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 8:22 PM] prabipyakurel
life


[8/23/2023 8:22 PM] sskarz
it really be like that lol


[8/23/2023 8:22 PM] sskarz
you'll make friends, takes time


[8/23/2023 8:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea, its gonna take some time, but i will find people


[8/23/2023 8:25 PM] prabipyakurel
i mean hopefully otherwise this year is gonna go by real slow and lonely


[8/23/2023 8:25 PM] sskarz
you're that social butterfly, i'm sure you're gonna be fine


[8/23/2023 8:25 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:26 PM] prabipyakurel
I really try, but sometimes i feel like people gonna find me weird if i just go up like that, but i will get to it, thanks!


[8/23/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
haha nobody will find you weird, hell I did that so many times today in my new classes and now I know them better


[8/23/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
you will be ay okay

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[8/23/2023 8:27 PM] prabipyakurel
ohhhh wow cool, did you just start a conversation with them?


[8/23/2023 8:27 PM] prabipyakurel
But you are like a chill person, so they probably just connected to you easily


[8/23/2023 8:28 PM] sskarz
yeah! like in the morning, I overheard a guy talk about replacing some of his pc parts and I just joined in, and the conversation was smooth, and now i have him in my contacts and we know each other

{Reactions}
👍 

[8/23/2023 8:28 PM] sskarz
you're chill too, idk why anyone would think you'd be weird


[8/23/2023 8:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Wow conversation about PC parts, but glad you met someone.

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/23/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
it was a computer science class, what else do you expect haha


[8/23/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh i bet you just slid into the conversation and it clicked


[8/23/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
well its something im super familiar with and i like partaking in those kinds of conversations


[8/23/2023 8:30 PM] sskarz
what i like to do is get to classes earlier than anyone, and those that come through like I'll try and talk to them just to ensure I know at least 1 other person in the class


[8/23/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
doesn't have to be anything meaningful at all, just so they know me and I know them so its easier for us to communicate later down the road


[8/23/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
like planting seeds yk


[8/23/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh yea i got there earlier too, but like there were a few people there already talking and it seemed rude to interrupt so i just sat and waited.


[8/23/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
*maybe i am the weird one for interrupting*


[8/23/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
hahaha


[8/23/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
That thought goes through my head, like i meet anyone new, and i have that thought that goes like "wait what if i am being nosy or disturbing" so i just smile and wait or something


[8/23/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
ah we are opposites, i'll just strike up a conversation or just join in for the sake of joining in, usually before class


[8/23/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
best time to make friends are before class starts


[8/23/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
or even like the sacred method, ask for a pencil because you "don't have one" and just go from there


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
imagine coming into college and asking for a pencil on the first day


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
damn sanskar, really, would not have expected that fom you


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
you'd be surprised of how often that happens


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
which part haha


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
the pencil trick?


[8/23/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
yea


[8/23/2023 8:36 PM] sskarz
oh cmon its the easiest thing to do if nothing else is gonna work


[8/23/2023 8:36 PM] prabipyakurel
the rest matches your extroverted personality and I can imagine you make friends fairly easily


[8/23/2023 8:36 PM] sskarz
works so often

[8/23/2023 8:37 PM] sskarz
i'd be so creeped out lmfao


[8/23/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
right go up to a person, just sit in that position in front of them, be all like that, "so what if i borrowed that pen of yours?"


[8/23/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
oh my god please don't try it, its obvious you don't know the sacred technique 💀


[8/23/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
no no it goes like this


[8/23/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
ahem


[8/23/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
there's someone sitting to my right, they look cool to talk to


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
i whisper as if im trying not to disturb anyone, for a pencil


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
nah I am not asking for anything, I will just go say hi and ask them some math question


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
then after class, i will return that pencil, and then talk with them afterwards about the class


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
i mean that works too haha


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
What if they just leave and let you keep it.


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
doesn't happen, like ever


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
imagine whispering into a random persons ear


[8/23/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
i swear this technique rarely fails

[8/23/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
i just tap them on the shoulder and then ask them in a low voice, not necessarily going into their ear canal 😂

its got like a 95% success rate


[8/23/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
but that's not really my go to, that's like last resort and i really want to talk to a specific person

{Reactions}
👍 

[8/23/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
i usually just ask someone somthing about the class and its easy from there


[8/23/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
somthing huh


[8/23/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
like literally it'll be: oh so what language do we use in this class? (coding language)


[8/23/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
and its just too easy


[8/23/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh nice, i guess that can work


[8/23/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
idk why i feel like im coaching you on how to talk to people 💀 
you just be you

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/23/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
if you're you, then people will naturally come to you


[8/23/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
simple as that


[8/23/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
No you are fine lol, you have like 2 years of experience


[8/23/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea lol, i will just smile at someone and sit alone and someone will be like, do you know where to go


[8/23/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
see? a natural


[8/23/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
I will just be me and see how it goes lo, gotta be another lonely person out there


[8/23/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
oh please you're not gonna be lonely 😂


[8/23/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
lol i try, but it randomly happens not because i want it to


[8/23/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
and sometimes it can lead to beautiful friendships


[8/23/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
i've met alot of my really good friends because they came up to me, and i had no interest in talking to them


[8/23/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
but as i learned they were pretty cool people so it all worked out


[8/23/2023 8:47 PM] prabipyakurel
No that happened a lot in high school, i would be bumping into the most random people.


[8/23/2023 8:47 PM] sskarz
college is literally just high school, except everyone is a little more grown up and there's so much more freedom


[8/23/2023 8:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea starting to feel like that


[8/23/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz
starting to feel more comfortable?


[8/23/2023 8:48 PM] prabipyakurel
a little yea, still scared but better.


[8/23/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz
it gets better every day


[8/23/2023 8:48 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
and of course, feel comfortable with the entire experience


[8/23/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
at least familiar with it


[8/23/2023 8:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Gotcha! the gps will just be in the background for reference you know


[8/23/2023 8:52 PM] prabipyakurel
so what are you doing right now?


[8/23/2023 8:53 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Nice, i finished my reading assignment before class tomorrow and i am just drinking this one tea that looked interesting from the dining hall


[8/23/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
i dont really like it tbh


[8/23/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
what kind of tea was it?


[8/23/2023 8:54 PM] prabipyakurel
some mint with herbs


[8/23/2023 8:54 PM] prabipyakurel
not that pleasant


[8/23/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
oh yeah that sounds interesting


[8/23/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
idk how i feel about that lol


[8/23/2023 8:55 PM] sskarz
i've never really tried any tea of that kind but it sounds dubious


[8/23/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
its one of those tea bags one


[8/23/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
not good, i threw it out in the sink rn

[8/23/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 8:58 PM] prabipyakurel
If I am being honest, the only thing I had here was the momo and kinda jamba juice but other than than, you know how I was a sick a few days back, yea still trying to recover before I try a bunch of unknown food.

[8/23/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
i thought you healed after that convo im ngl


[8/23/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
well at least its getting better


[8/23/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel
No no its not rough like that lol, maybe getting used to the weather here too


[8/23/2023 9:01 PM] prabipyakurel

well not too often but often


[8/23/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol yea when people choke on water i laugh, but if someone is actually choking it will traumatize me, like I will start freaking out.


[8/23/2023 9:04 PM] sskarz
please tell me you know the heimleich maneuver


[8/23/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
No i know how its done, but I will freeze and it just scares me when I see those situations


[8/23/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
if you don't it would be useful to know in those kinds of situations


[8/23/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
oh i gotcha


[8/23/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
yea I have watched how to do it, just would never do it because I will just freeze


[8/23/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
do you know?


[8/23/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
mhmmm


[8/23/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice nice, yea thats pretty helpful to know


[8/23/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
oh um completely unrelated topic here


[8/23/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
did you hear about how india landed a spacecraft on the moon today?


[8/23/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
omg really


[8/23/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
they're the 4th country in the world to do so, they won the race against russia


[8/23/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
yeah


[8/23/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
wait let me search that up


[8/23/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
russia's spacecraft actually failed


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
damn i thought russia would be far ahead


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
but india wow


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
pretty facinating


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
yeah its as big moment for them


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
happy to see some brown representation on the moon


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
its actually unfortunate for what happened to their spacecraft


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
like it was heading towards the moon, but something went awry


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
yea true tho


[8/23/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
and the entire thing just got destroyed


[8/23/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
it crashed into the moon


[8/23/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel
yikes but like they are russia i feel like will try again


[8/23/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz
maybe not, especially because of how the war with ukraine is happening, their space agency is losing even more funding now


[8/23/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz
it might just collapse for good


[8/23/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz
which is crazy to think about


[8/23/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh right, actually that might be correct, yea the war is like messing them up


[8/23/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
yeah and their economy is just tanking so, really who knows what's going to happen


[8/23/2023 9:15 PM] prabipyakurel
idk about their future, they messes up bad


[8/23/2023 9:15 PM] sskarz

he's responsible for thousands of deaths


[8/23/2023 9:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
fr


[8/23/2023 9:16 PM] prabipyakurel
but he needs to suffer, lol he cant just die


[8/23/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
like in a torture chamber would be pretty good


[8/23/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
maybe rot in a cell


[8/23/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Something like that lol

[8/23/2023 9:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Forgot about it because of the dumb math professor and just remembered


[8/23/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
damn i was really hoping that was just a fever dream i had


[8/23/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah you really sent that


[8/23/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
yep that i did.


[8/23/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
what're you thinking about it?


[8/23/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Sanskar I am going to be very honest with you here, I am think of something but too scared to tell you in case it’s not correct.


[8/23/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
Oh I gotcha


[8/23/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
Well, if you want you can just rip it and see how it goes


[8/23/2023 9:27 PM] prabipyakurel
No but what if you don’t like it


[8/23/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
hmmmm


[8/23/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
I mean you'd have to downright insult me for me not to like it lol


[8/23/2023 9:28 PM] prabipyakurel

Wait let me think

wait


[8/23/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
I don't think you should say it


[8/23/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz
Only because I remember saying, if you're not 100% confident, then maybe don't say it


[8/23/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz
And I can see that you're really scared, and I don't want you to feel forced to do something you don't want to do


[8/23/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
No I am scared but I just want to know


[8/23/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel

What happened, your confidence was through the roof yesterday?


[8/23/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
I mean it wasn't like through the roof or anything like that, I just had soon forgot about it afterwards, and I just got reminded haha


[8/23/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
You know its kind of a big deal for me


[8/23/2023 9:34 PM] prabipyakurel
No it still has me thinking too, lol I have been going back to our conversations to see what I missed


[8/23/2023 9:35 PM] sskarz
Have you really solved the entire riddle?


[8/23/2023 9:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/23/2023 9:36 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 9:36 PM] prabipyakurel
No that’s what I am afraid of too, what if I say a name and it’s not the correct one for you


[8/23/2023 9:37 PM] sskarz
I want to tell you but I don't know if its the right time


[8/23/2023 9:37 PM] sskarz
That's what I'm afraid of


[8/23/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Got for it.


[8/23/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel
But up to you


[8/23/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel
If you feel comfortable sharing, i hope I am not forcing you


[8/23/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
You're not at all


[8/23/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
I'm just thinking


[8/23/2023 9:38 PM] prabipyakurel

Literally jeopardy music for sure

😂 

[8/23/2023 9:40 PM] sskarz
Well, I feel like it'd kind of sound anti-climactic if I just texted it to you


[8/23/2023 9:40 PM] sskarz
at the same time you'd probably be annoyed if I didn't say anything 😂

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/23/2023 9:41 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s okay, you share it how you want to and how you would like to, I am open.


[8/23/2023 9:41 PM] sskarz
I would like to say it face to face but that's not possible, just to build up the suspense haha


[8/23/2023 9:41 PM] prabipyakurel
That really isn’t


[8/23/2023 9:51 PM] sskarz (pinned)
Prabi, you are one of the nicest people I've ever met in my life. You are always there to brighten up my days. Even when I can be too honest at times, you accepted me for who I am and I honestly couldn't ask for any better. You truly are amazingier 😂 
I won't try to hide anymore and I will just be honest, like I always have.
I like you, Prabi. You've got the nicest smile, the kindest heart, and the best mean side I've seen on anyone. You're the only one I could tolerate being messed with all day and everyday, and it's because I love talking with you. I don't know any other person who I could talk to hours on end and always come out with a smile. You're beautiful, smart as all hell, and even a little clumsy but it just cements this in my heart more.
Now I just want to say, if this isn't what you thought it was going to be, I'm really sorry.

[8/23/2023 9:52 PM] sskarz
All I ask for is your honesty


[8/23/2023 9:56 PM] prabipyakurel
First of all, I always thought you were cute and so sweet, and when you sent that poem and said that it was specifically for me, i wanted to tell you I liked you on the spot, but lol I was so scared to tell you in case you didn’t think that way about me. No like I like you a lot, and you are my first. No need to apologize, honestly you are so sweet and funny and smart and everything. Like god made you for me god dammit, I just didn’t want to share yesterday because I thought that only I had feelings for you, but I am glad you shared. You are amazinger and you know it. Ahhhhhhhh, thank you for being honest with me. ❤️

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[8/23/2023 9:57 PM] prabipyakurel
The way I feel talking to you is unmatched to any other conversation I ever have, and lol I have made your spelling worse the more we talk 😂 but overall yes I like you a lot.


[8/23/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
Oh my I'm so relieved right now, you have no idea I was pacing in my room about to eat my own hands alive. I'm so glad you feel the same way, I really wanted to tell you in person somehow but it's just not possible and I done did the mistake of going too far yesterday with the easy riddle to solve haha. But I'm so so so so so so so so glad, I really thought I was the only one holding these feelings back I won't lie 😂 .


[8/23/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
I really like you, and I'm really glad that you like me too ❤️

[8/23/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nah when you started typing I had to go back down from my bunk bed, like walk around and panic while my roommates were doing their nighttime routine in the restroom. Like I was stressing and sweating 😂, and you aren’t the only one holding back feelings, that was me like a while back. And when you came over to my house, I couldn’t show it because lol everyone was there, but I just wanted to hug you and tell you that you were the cutest person. 😊

{Reactions}
😂 ❤️ 

[8/23/2023 10:05 PM] sskarz
OMG if I didn't need to leave so early, I really wanted to talk to you. Like when you came and said goodbye, I just wanted to have that conversation but I... got a little scared I won't lie. You know when we talk it all seems so obvious now, but I swear to you I thought I was the only one on this side of our conversations that had these feelings I couldn't share! Really, I would've much rather told you in person but I just missed my chance, so forgive me for telling you like this. I wanted to make it special

[8/23/2023 10:06 PM] sskarz

I wanted to scream it out the door, you don’t even know and no need to apologize.


[8/23/2023 10:09 PM] sskarz
you are honestly the cutest ❤️


[8/23/2023 10:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh no you aren’t alone, when you asked me have I found someone worthy, I was about to be like “yea you” but I got scared so I stuck to “maybe”


[8/23/2023 10:10 PM] prabipyakurel
And then you said yes so I wanted to confirm if it was me or not.


[8/23/2023 10:10 PM] sskarz

[8/23/2023 10:10 PM] sskarz

You explain, how was I?


[8/23/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
Okay so let me just copy paste it here so I can remember 💀


[8/23/2023 10:18 PM] prabipyakurel
To the waves that carry
A sign was shown
A place unimaginable
And unfathomable
There in their eyes they witnessed
Witnessed with me
The letter that spelled thee


[8/23/2023 10:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Here go


[8/23/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
o thank u

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[8/23/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
First line: the key word was 'waves', like the ocean waves
Second line: a 'sign'  was referring to the letter
Third and fourth line: i'm ngl i just put this out there to try and confuse you 😂 
Fifth and sixth line: I was referencing when we were playing battleships, the last match before I had to leave, when we revealed both of our fleets, and mine was in a special shape
Last line: The letter was a P, and it stood for Prabi, you :)


[8/23/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz
It's why I said I wanted to test your memory haha


[8/23/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel

I unfortunately have to sleep early tonight, I've got to setup for a club rush tomorrow for my club and it starts at 9 am, which means I need to be awake by like 6 am

Hey hey, hope I’m not disturbing you


[8/24/2023 7:36 PM] sskarz
how was your day?


[8/24/2023 8:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey hey, not at all, you are never disturbing me. My day was pretty busy, I had the other 4 classes today and I MADE FRIENDS. I loved my sociology class, it was very active and discussion based. Then I went to my english philosophy class which was pretty fun, the teacher was awesome. After that I hurried back to get some lunch after like 12 to around 1, then left to my discussions from 4 to 5 o clock and then ran all the way across campus to go to my history class fom 5 to 6. After that i came back, said bye to one roommate and then went to eat dinner and said bye to my other roommate. Now I am alone and have no one to talk to, sorry for getting back late, was having a little convo with my mom.

[8/24/2023 8:02 PM] sskarz
seeeeeeee I told you'd make friends, and you were doubting smh haha, In all seriousness tho, sounds like you had an amazing day! See, college can be real fun when you get these experiences. Oh and no worries, you don't need to say sorry ever lol

[8/24/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz
Yeah today's been a day lol, I've been working for like 12 hours straight and I just got to sit down and relax. So I started my day at around 6 am and headed to the gym, then back home, showered, then arrived at campus at 8. I organized a team yesterday to setup this tabling event you saw from my instagram post, so we set that up and it took us about an hour and a half to get materials and setup. Then I had to present to a lecture hall of 100 students about our club and I had to do that by myself because my partner forgot about it lol. After that, I went and sat around my club booth for about 2 hours and helped people sign up and told them about our club. And then I had another class presentation in my actual class, and after my class was over, I headed to the library to get the work done from that class. It was like 4pm at this point, so I headed to Sam's Club and grabbed some workout protein stuff because I was running out, and that was busy so it took me till 5:30 to come back home. Once I was back home, I fed the dog and then worked on my Saturday curriculuum for my students and then had some server work to do. And then my mom made really good food, but I was already over like my diet stuff, so then after dinner, like at around 6:30, I went for a 5 mile run. I'm really proud of this one because I actually ran it without ever stopping, just ran and jogged the entire thing through which was crazy. And then I just came back home from that, showered, and I'm like dead as all hell 😂


[8/24/2023 8:08 PM] sskarz
it has been a **day**


[8/24/2023 8:08 PM] prabipyakurel

Ahhhhh damn, and i thought my little walk around the campus was a lot. Good Job though, proud of you. 5 miles is a lottttttt.Glad the club went well and the fact that you lectured to 100 students is wild. You have had a day. Do you just listen to music and think about nothing when you run?


[8/24/2023 8:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Take care though, make sure you rest, you know drink tea if needed and cool yourself.

[8/24/2023 8:25 PM] sskarz

[8/24/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
well i'm ngl, i used khan academy like crazy when I was going through my calc classes in high school


[8/24/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
they explain the concepts pretty well


[8/24/2023 8:28 PM] prabipyakurel
No I am still using that, I taught myself a little about limits and how they work using khan academy


[8/24/2023 8:28 PM] prabipyakurel
like during the summer


[8/24/2023 8:28 PM] sskarz
good good! limits is the first  concept you learn about


[8/24/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
from there you'll transition to derivatives, and from there to anti-derivatives aka integrals

{Reactions}
👍 

[8/24/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
how did you feel about limits?


[8/24/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
I feel like I got the basics down, and if he went on from there, i should be able to pick it up.


[8/24/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
then you're golden


[8/24/2023 8:30 PM] sskarz
honestly if you're worried, what you can do is keep ahead in the khan academy lessons comparatively to his lessons, and it'll help you call back concepts easier and with a lot more understanding


[8/24/2023 8:30 PM] sskarz
I wouldn't say study the entire course catalog in a single day, but be a couple lessons ahead so you know what to expect


[8/24/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea, omg i was literally thinking of doing that, you fr reading my thoughts rn.

No it happens everytime, when I see a bug or spider, I am going to see something in my dream, I already know it.

[8/25/2023 4:25 PM] sskarz
hbu?


[8/25/2023 4:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Nothing too interesting, math was simple and he scared me less today, and I learned that there has been a Covid outbreak in the residence halls so that’s why I was sick the past few days probably 😂


[8/25/2023 4:26 PM] sskarz
ohhhhhh yeah I guess that would make sense, you were coughing after all

{Reactions}
👍 

[8/25/2023 4:27 PM] sskarz
did you guys do limits today?


[8/25/2023 4:27 PM] sskarz
or just review of pre-calc or something


[8/25/2023 4:28 PM] prabipyakurel
No he said that limits is actually going to be after like the midterms, today he just went over the importance of exponents and their rules. he took way too long talking about the logistics of the class that he had only 10 minutes at the end for whatever he wanted to teach.


[8/25/2023 4:28 PM] prabipyakurel
It was fairly short.


[8/25/2023 4:28 PM] sskarz
oh wow exponents? i guess setting up for derivatives, but that's weird, i've never seen calc 1 be taught with limits not being the first topic lol


[8/25/2023 4:29 PM] sskarz
i guess it makes sense because connecting limits and derivatives is towards the end of the semester


[8/25/2023 4:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea thats what I thought too, but he said he wanted to get started with pre calc stuff and then move on.


[8/25/2023 4:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Probably, I am just waiting for this one to be over because it is a part of another one that I will have to take next semester.


[8/25/2023 4:30 PM] sskarz
you have another math course after this?


[8/25/2023 4:30 PM] sskarz
is it calc 2?


[8/25/2023 4:31 PM] prabipyakurel
No its like math 16B, and the one I am taking right now is math 16A


[8/25/2023 4:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Sort of like a part B of a class


[8/25/2023 4:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Its a series


[8/25/2023 4:32 PM] sskarz
ohhhh huh


[8/25/2023 4:32 PM] sskarz
but 16A lasts an entire semester?


[8/25/2023 4:32 PM] prabipyakurel
yea


[8/25/2023 4:33 PM] sskarz
oh so i guess it includes calc 2 probably


[8/25/2023 4:33 PM] sskarz
eh you'll be fine


[8/25/2023 4:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Most likely yea


[8/25/2023 4:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea hopefully this class somewhat prepares me for the next one other wise im doomed again.


[8/25/2023 4:35 PM] sskarz
you will be good dw about anything


[8/25/2023 4:35 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 7:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea they are old


[8/25/2023 7:32 PM] prabipyakurel
But like when we go down, we got to use the stairs unless you wannna wait 10 minutes for the elevator to land on out floor. But going up is easier, we scan our student card and wait for it to open.


[8/25/2023 7:32 PM] sskarz
ohh how many floors does your dorm have?


[8/25/2023 7:32 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Lovely


[8/25/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
And then my brother was there asking the dumbest questions


[8/25/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
😂


[8/25/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
yeah I wanted to show you the things I enjoy in hopes it would create conversation


[8/25/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
No it did, i called that thing a briefcase before I knew what it was so


[8/25/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
i thought you would have gone with them, i was ready to go sit with aunties


[8/25/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
i really wanted to have a chance to just talk to you


[8/25/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
it was when we were playing card games and you joined in, and then they said they wanted to get food


[8/25/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
but i really didn't, i thought i'd miss my chance


[8/25/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
That was another one of those nights to remember


[8/25/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel
No I left smiling and continued smiling on my way home to bed


[8/25/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:47 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea, that was quite funny


[8/25/2023 8:47 PM] sskarz

there was always something about them


[8/25/2023 8:48 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
and my parents were surprised to see me be so eager at times haha


[8/25/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 8:51 PM] prabipyakurel
No no, when you left from my house both times, my mom would start the convo and be like, he is so sweet and caring and nice, and my dad would nod his head. That was a pretty good sign


[8/25/2023 8:51 PM] prabipyakurel
My brother would give me those eyebrows looks and I would just pretend that that i totally didnt have a crush on you

the way you'd snap at him if he even breathed the wrong way 😂


[8/25/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
No but thats because when we were playing card in your sisters room, everyone would be sitting normally and he be laying down and saying the weirdest things

[8/25/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
someone worse for sure


[8/25/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea she is really sweet and caring and knows how to calm people down, i remember when I got waitlisted from UCLA, I called her and she made me feel okay and I stopped stressing. I would have panicked and done something if she didnt say some of those uplifting things to me. She is amazing and the prettiest person I know.

Damn, your cousin was with you upstairs in my room when we were playing battleship


[8/25/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/25/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
oh yeah, he came upstairs to see how we were both getting along


[8/25/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
he kept giving you that stare


[8/25/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
he's so interested in relationships or anything potential like that


[8/25/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
like if he got my phone for a second, he'd search everything i swear

But hey I know that we wont see each other often and that we are far away from each other, and I hope that this long distance thing works for us. I know its a little hard and you might not want it to be this way but let me know if you ever feel like its a little difficult. But no matter how far we are, always know that I will love you, support you, and be with you, no matter the distance. I just wanted to tell you : )

[8/25/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
Hey hey, long distance is not a big thing for me. I mean of course I miss you, but just talking to you everyday like this or calling, it helps a lot and I know when I get to see you again, I won't be worrying about anything. I'll always be here to love you, support you, be with you, no matter the distance too :). I just want to assure you, that as long as I'm a functioning human being with emotions, I want to be with you.

but to shorten things down


[8/25/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz
essentially, she cheated on me, and obviously when someone cheats on you, you feel like the worst, so I ended things with her.


[8/25/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
oh geez, im so sorry, yea no its good that you ended it off.

[8/25/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz

[8/25/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
its just a life lesson


[8/25/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
No I am glad you ended it when you did, that sucks, from what I saw happen to my friend this years, i hate cheaters


[8/25/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
And because people cheat, that is why sometimes it takes me a while to fully like a guy you know, like some of them are nice and all and they have done many bad things.


[8/25/2023 10:27 PM] sskarz
I totally get that, you have to protect yourself from them yk?

No need to ever thank me, you are so strong and confident, it makes me happy that I have someone like you, you have not done anything wrong for me to look at you from any other perspective. You are just being you and went though things that you didn't deserve at all, but things are getting better for you and will continue to hopefully. But keep your head up, you are my boy and you got this. I will always accept you for who you are and your struggles that you have over come. No need to ever thank me again, I mean it, dont.

[8/26/2023 7:45 PM] sskarz
well I'm ngl I was so tired after the class, and then hearing that I had to carry stuff back and forth between houses I was like ughh. But I went and did it, and that took like 2 hours. So afterwards, I was like, I already did so much lifting, so I might as well just go straight into a workout. Drove from my cousin's house, to my house, got some caffeine and then went to the gym. So here's the crazy part: I met Bijesh and the whole gang there and they were working out too. As well as one CSULA student that recognized me from doing the presentations in multiple of their classes lol. That was pretty cool, and then I got like a 2 hour workout in. Absolutely exhausted myself, came back home, showered and drank tons of water.


[8/26/2023 7:47 PM] sskarz
also you are just too cute haha

[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
i fr might go deaf for how loud i put the music in my ears lol


[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
You probably listen to some motivating music at the gym no?


[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
yup


[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
No sometimes I do that and have to take them out to see if I can still hear.


[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
haha yeah


[8/26/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
i might need to do one of those hearing tests they do in like those hospital checkups


[8/26/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
where you raise your hand depending on where you hear the pitch


[8/26/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
No like actually, I got that done and they told me I need to go check it out.


[8/26/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz
my hearing has definitely gotten worse over the years


[8/26/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Its probably like ear wax


[8/26/2023 8:34 PM] sskarz

[8/26/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea, keep him away, the last thing i need is someone accidently getting their hands on our conversation.


[8/26/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
mhmmmm


[8/26/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
might need to invest into a privacy screen 😂


[8/26/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Your heart probably did that "oh shit" thing


[8/26/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
but then again, that's probably raising more suspicions then protecting anything


[8/26/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea parents are gonna be like, why did you suddenly decide to put that?

{Reactions}

[8/26/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz

[8/26/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel
No me neither, yea we will get older, and be successful, then when we are both able to, confront them somehow, I dont know how the hell, but someway that doesnt involve getting a lecture back.

[8/26/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
And if there was a party the previous night, maybe not sunday morning.


[8/26/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz

[8/26/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz

Hahaha yeah you were elusive, too small of hints to tell if you were just being nice or you liked me


[8/26/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
and I thought if I gave away too much, you would slowly disconnect from me


[8/26/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
No I would never, my heart always raced and beat so fast when I talked to you.


[8/26/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Like I would have discord open so I would never miss your message.

[8/26/2023 9:18 PM] sskarz
I need this on vinyl, I’ve decided


[8/26/2023 9:18 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/26/2023 9:20 PM] prabipyakurel
And i missed you, the one person I should have gotten it from.


[8/26/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
I wanted to ask for your number, but I thought it was too soon haha


[8/26/2023 9:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Like then?


[8/26/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
Yeah, the first day


[8/26/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
No lie


[8/26/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
I was unsure still because I hadn’t felt like that before, but I wanted to see what would happen if I gave it a chance


[8/26/2023 9:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea and trust me when I say this, I am not a big fan of giving my number out and will avoid the question, but that night I saw you and I was like, okay if he asks, you give it to him.


[8/26/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
And then I got scared 😂


[8/26/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
That’s completely fair, I’m kinda glad I waited till I confessed my love for you 😂


[8/26/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
Just to be sure yk


[8/26/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I was so scared, you and my brother and the kid went upstairs, and I came in after, I thought you were gonna find me so weird and all.


[8/26/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
Noooo I was interested in talking with you the most


[8/26/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Trust me the love was already there, we both were just doubting it.


[8/26/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
But you gave me shy girl vibes so I didn’t want to force any conversation that would lead to my demise haha


[8/26/2023 9:23 PM] sskarz
just rode the wave for what you were comfortable with


[8/26/2023 9:23 PM] prabipyakurel
You are so sweet


[8/26/2023 9:23 PM] sskarz
My #1 goal with meeting new people and getting to know them is having them be comfortable around me


[8/26/2023 9:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally I saw you after your dad called and introduced you and i was like just staring at you.

[8/26/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
I was like dad stoppppp


[8/26/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
You’re turning her awayyyy


[8/26/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
No he wasnt, because he came to ours for the previous meeting and he was talking about how you went to mark keppel and then he moved you and stuff, and I was so excited to meet you that time.


[8/26/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
And then I did, and it was just amazing, I followed your mom when she was giving the house tour to the other people and I was like "great chance to go up and introduce myself to him"

My heart warms up so much when I even read your messages, and then i just freeze and I love that feeling.


[8/26/2023 9:28 PM] prabipyakurel
And there was this other time when there was some sort of event at your house, but only my parents went because I think we had someone over and I think your dad had told you that we were coming, and my dad was like sanskar came down to meet you, we should have taken you.


[8/26/2023 9:28 PM] prabipyakurel
I was like seriously, like I was begging for them to take me.


[8/26/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
OMG yeah I wanted to see you


[8/26/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
I was kinda sad when I couldn’t see you


[8/26/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz
I was like damn, did I say something or do something to make her avoid me?


[8/26/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz
The classic doubting haha


[8/26/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh no never


[8/26/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea and my mom was like, he came running but didnt get to meet you.


[8/26/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
I was like, "yuh because you didnt take me when I wanted to go"


[8/26/2023 9:30 PM] sskarz
You had no idea, I heard your parents were coming over and I made sure to look and be my best haha


[8/26/2023 9:30 PM] sskarz
I wanted to make better impressions

[8/26/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Like when I used to go to alish dada's house for the teej programs and stuff, I would take a little walk around their house just to see if I could get like a small glimpse of you from anywhere.


[8/26/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Like I felt so happy just going to their house, knowing you were right next door.


[8/26/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz

And you were there


[8/26/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
And that’s all my brain needed to keep it as a vivid memory


[8/26/2023 9:38 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea your parents came in and my dad was like, "sanskar didn't come" and your dad was like he was a little busy, and I was like oh okay, not gonna see him.


[8/26/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
But I did!


[8/26/2023 9:38 PM] prabipyakurel
No and trust me, when you appeared from the back, I was like, omg.

I have never felt this way with anyone, it was an amazing feeling.


[8/26/2023 9:41 PM] sskarz
Me neither, this is unlike anything I’ve ever felt


[8/26/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
Like I’ve never felt so connected with someone


[8/26/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
Even just texting you


[8/26/2023 9:42 PM] prabipyakurel
No just that conversation on fourth of july set this thing off and I was so amazed by that.


[8/26/2023 9:42 PM] sskarz
I just know you’re out there, striving to be your best, and that makes me love you so much more


[8/26/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz
I’m so so so so so glad I sent it


[8/26/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz
I was really close to just saying, ah that’s stupid I shouldn’t just say this out of nowhere


[8/26/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz
But something just felt right


[8/26/2023 9:43 PM] sskarz

But now when you tell me that you wanted it to start a conversation and as to why you sent it to the both if us, it is the most sweetest thing ever.

We got many things to do, and as I get used to like college and stuff, after some time I should be able to tell my parents like I am going with a few friends of mine, and they wont mind. Other times I will sneak out to see you.


[8/26/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
Hahaha sneak out with a backup plan okay, I don’t wanna do anything that’s gonna jeopardize us


[8/26/2023 10:01 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/26/2023 10:03 PM] prabipyakurel
But we are not doing anything illegal, its just when you have strict parents and a strict  household in general, everytime I am talking to you and they barge in, I got to act like I am hiding drugs.

[8/26/2023 10:10 PM] sskarz
I don’t exactly have the best history with bees


[8/26/2023 10:11 PM] sskarz
Back in my old house, there was this huge hive right outside my garage and every time I left the house, I had to run past the active hive just so I wouldn’t piss off any hornet that was bored and wanted to sting someone lol

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/26/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz
They fr traumatized me with how they chased me sometimes 😭


[8/26/2023 10:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Did you ever get bitten though?


[8/26/2023 10:12 PM] sskarz
Surprisingly I have no memory of being stung


[8/26/2023 10:12 PM] prabipyakurel
They probably went out to sting those that deserved it


[8/26/2023 10:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Are you still a little scared of them?


[8/26/2023 10:13 PM] sskarz
If I see one near me I’m running at least half a mile before I check over my shoulder 😂


[8/26/2023 10:13 PM] sskarz
It’s one of the few insects that actually scare me


[8/26/2023 10:13 PM] prabipyakurel
No I got you, if there is a bee or a wasp, I will get it away from you


[8/26/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
Omg you’re really perfect, my savior


[8/26/2023 10:14 PM] sskarz
I gotchu from spiders you don’t even need to worry


[8/26/2023 10:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea no, like when I go out to water my flowers back home, the bees be chillin flying doing their thing and if they come near me, the most I would do is shut the front door so they wont get in


[8/26/2023 10:15 PM] prabipyakurel
But I just wave my hands slightly and they will move on


[8/26/2023 10:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Don't worry, nothing is harming you


[8/26/2023 10:15 PM] prabipyakurel
I love you

[8/26/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
No there are always wasps around my new house, and like multiple used to just hover when I was watering the plans, I think there might be a small hive under one of the bushes or something.


[8/26/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
But wasps are okay, if you leave them alone too


[8/26/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Now those flying beetles and big cockroaches, those are a problem, I will leave and run.


[8/26/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
They all banded together, had a bee meeting, and said if they saw me it’s sting on sight I swear 😭


[8/26/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz

[8/27/2023 7:39 AM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh seems like an easy day.


[8/27/2023 7:39 AM] prabipyakurel
How long do you plan to stay at the gym?


[8/27/2023 7:40 AM] sskarz
Eh probably an hour or hour and a half max


[8/27/2023 7:40 AM] sskarz
It’s leg day so I don’t wanna spend more time than I need to


[8/27/2023 7:40 AM] prabipyakurel

[8/27/2023 7:42 AM] sskarz
Every leg day is 😭


[8/27/2023 7:42 AM] prabipyakurel
Yikes do you only focus on working out your legs


[8/27/2023 7:42 AM] sskarz
On leg days yeah


[8/27/2023 7:42 AM] sskarz
So I have a 3 day split for different workouts


[8/27/2023 7:42 AM] prabipyakurel
I have no idea what that is when people say leg day, I assume you only work on the legs


[8/27/2023 7:43 AM] sskarz
It’s called Push Pull Legs.
On Push day it’s all about chest, shoulders, and Tricep
On Pull day it’s all about back, and bicep
On Leg day it’s everything lower half of the body


[8/27/2023 7:44 AM] sskarz
Yup basically


[8/27/2023 7:44 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow, damn, I need to learn things fr


[8/27/2023 7:45 AM] sskarz

Ah, too tired to take it apart and all?


[8/27/2023 6:29 PM] sskarz
Ooooh the momo sounds fire


[8/27/2023 6:29 PM] sskarz
Yeah, it’s honestly more mental than anything haha


[8/27/2023 6:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it was good, and then like you know the oil inside the momo, like it squirted everywhere when I bit into it, omg i was just using the sanitizing wipes to wipe everything down.

[8/27/2023 6:32 PM] prabipyakurel
No its okay, I was doing the same, I was panicking a little, but got through a good amount of reading for the day.


[8/27/2023 6:32 PM] sskarz
Also don’t your roommates come back tonight or tomorrow?


[8/27/2023 6:32 PM] sskarz
Why the panicking?

[8/27/2023 6:32 PM] prabipyakurel
I don't know exactly why, but I just got scared about everything and it just happened.


[8/27/2023 6:33 PM] sskarz
Like a panic attack?


[8/27/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel
But then I had momo and started watching this new pakistani drama, so doing better.

[8/27/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel

Oh okay, glad you’re doing better now


[8/27/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I dont have panic attacks, when I need to let it out, I usually just cry in a pillow or just like in the restroom, the one time i did have a panic attack was when I was picking classes.


[8/27/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
That was just a horrible day


[8/27/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
Yeah I remember, you were super stressed out


[8/27/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
Hey if you’re panicking about stuff, talk to me. I can knock some sense back in haha


[8/27/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz
and all of the work i could just do outside of the class


[8/28/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
No but in high school I had classes where I went in and was like okay nap time, and no one cared.


[8/28/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Like people had to text me to wake up


[8/28/2023 9:00 PM] prabipyakurel
And I had to do the same for notes


[8/28/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz
ohhhh and this happened recently, my english teacher also called me and a couple others out for turning in an in class assignment before the class had even started (because she posted the entire list of assignments on canvas so now im like 2 weeks ahead on work)


[8/28/2023 9:00 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
oh fr?


[8/28/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/28/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz

[8/28/2023 9:18 PM] sskarz
when we used to talk like in the early stage, we talked one time on instagram, and when i said bye to you after talking to you, you sent me like a heart emoji


[8/28/2023 9:18 PM] sskarz
and at the time i was like, wait am i looking at this right?


[8/28/2023 9:18 PM] sskarz
i spent like 20 minutes staring at that emoji 😂


[8/28/2023 9:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Okay okay, let me explain, I remember


[8/28/2023 9:19 PM] prabipyakurel
I thought that when you press on the heart, more emojis pop up and I was going to use bye, but then it just sent and I didn’t know how to unsend.


[8/28/2023 9:19 PM] prabipyakurel
😭


[8/28/2023 9:19 PM] sskarz
LMAOOOOOOOOOO

[8/28/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
i couldn't pass up the opportunity in case it was intentional


[8/28/2023 9:21 PM] sskarz
and then the entire heart reacting started


[8/28/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
i paid attention to every detail i swear


[8/28/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Dude I wish you could see the way you talked to me and how I felt through my shoes.


[8/28/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel

No but sometimes tell me if I am ever being a little mean, and if it’s not the time for jokes like ever when you aren’t feeling nice or something, let me know so I don’t call you a loser after you fell and got hurt or something.

[8/28/2023 9:44 PM] prabipyakurel
No it made sense when I met you too

Couldn’t sleep till then


[8/29/2023 8:39 AM] prabipyakurel

[8/29/2023 8:39 AM] prabipyakurel
I slept probably around 11:30 to 12


[8/29/2023 8:39 AM] prabipyakurel
Just had to stare at the ceiling for a while


[8/29/2023 8:39 AM] prabipyakurel
You know, the daily routine 😂

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/29/2023 8:40 AM] sskarz
Hahaha yeah


[8/29/2023 8:40 AM] sskarz
I had one of the mini insomniac nights


[8/29/2023 8:40 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh, do you also toss and turn when you can’t sleep?


[8/29/2023 8:40 AM] sskarz
I was so tired, yet my body was like nah we can’t sleep rn


[8/29/2023 8:40 AM] sskarz
Yeahhh


[8/29/2023 8:41 AM] prabipyakurel
No sometimes that happens, and it’s really annoying


[8/29/2023 8:41 AM] prabipyakurel
Glad I am not the only one, I like move so much, and change sleeping positions and all and still can’t fall asleep when I need to.


[8/29/2023 8:42 AM] sskarz
Haha yeah it just be like that sometimes


[8/29/2023 8:42 AM] sskarz
Usually I can sleep in a matter of like 5 minutes


[8/29/2023 8:42 AM] sskarz
But there are those nights where it’s really hard


[8/29/2023 8:43 AM] prabipyakurel
Do you ever try just shutting your eyes for a super long time?


[8/29/2023 8:43 AM] sskarz
Yeah for like 10 minutes, and if that doesn’t work then I just start watching some boring YouTube video in hopes I fall asleep from that lol


[8/29/2023 8:44 AM] sskarz
That’s basically what I did last night


[8/29/2023 8:45 AM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh I see, but yea take care of yourself, um maybe try something different with your routine to help.


[8/29/2023 8:45 AM] sskarz
Only happens once in a while dw


[8/29/2023 8:46 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh ok, also do you sleep with the lights on, like a little night light or do you need it pitch black?


[8/29/2023 8:46 AM] sskarz
I sleep with the lights off, but I have a small night light that barely illuminates, but it’s enough for me to not bump into anything if I got up 😂


[8/29/2023 8:47 AM] sskarz
Wbu?


[8/29/2023 8:47 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see I see, I need darkness, I cannot even have like a little bright light from anywhere


[8/29/2023 8:47 AM] prabipyakurel
Like you know sometimes like this random thing in your room is giving off like a little dot of light, no I cover that thing all the way


[8/29/2023 8:48 AM] sskarz
Oh damn, what if you’re getting light from like a window


[8/29/2023 8:48 AM] prabipyakurel
But I mean I can still fall asleep with lights on, it’s just not as fast


[8/29/2023 8:48 AM] prabipyakurel
Window is fine, yea light from window is fine


[8/29/2023 8:48 AM] sskarz
Ohh okay gotcha


[8/29/2023 8:49 AM] sskarz
Yeah I’ve gotta be like dead tired to sleep with lights on


[8/29/2023 8:49 AM] prabipyakurel
No yea otherwise it’s difficult


[8/29/2023 8:50 AM] prabipyakurel
But like sometimes I occasionally wake up after nightmares and I will just be walking around my room trynna find the light switch


[8/29/2023 8:50 AM] prabipyakurel
That’s the only time I actually kind of get scared


[8/29/2023 8:50 AM] sskarz
Mhmmmm


[8/29/2023 8:51 AM] sskarz

[8/29/2023 12:41 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s pretty to look at


[8/29/2023 12:42 PM] prabipyakurel
But the way I pass this building to get to my 11:00 class from a class that ends at 10:59, it’s crazy!


[8/29/2023 12:43 PM] sskarz
Yeah I was gonna mention that the other day, do u just get there late? No way you can get there in 1 min 😂


[8/29/2023 12:43 PM] prabipyakurel
There is Berkeley time here which is when the class starts 10 min later then the said time so students and professors can get there in time.


[8/29/2023 12:43 PM] sskarz
Ohhh okay that is nice


[8/29/2023 12:43 PM] prabipyakurel
But like if the class extends just 2 min past 10, it’s the worst walk over there


[8/29/2023 12:44 PM] sskarz
I can imagine lol, the campus is huge


[8/29/2023 12:44 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s the time of the week where I drink the most water 😂


[8/29/2023 12:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Are you back from the gym?

It was normal as usual, nothing too interesting. I have a new sociology project and for the other 2 classes I did notes. That’s pretty much it. Yea I will go check out the university library tomorrow.

[8/29/2023 9:03 PM] prabipyakurel
That probably doesn’t count


[8/29/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
The controller is so difficult


[8/29/2023 9:04 PM] sskarz

[8/29/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
Or maybe that yea


[8/29/2023 9:04 PM] prabipyakurel
But like idk it never really caught my attention in any way


[8/29/2023 9:04 PM] sskarz

[8/29/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz

[8/29/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Remember I played it in front of you when you came over to our old house and you said something about pumpkin head and stuff


[8/29/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel

wait until you realize i only started learning a year before i got that cert 💀


[8/29/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah but you were far from dumb, maybe you saw yourself that way because you have grown now, but I am sure your mind was just as sharp.


[8/29/2023 9:11 PM] prabipyakurel

That took a while, she just had some interesting boy stories lol


[8/29/2023 10:15 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh I see


[8/29/2023 10:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Were  they good boy stories or like no?


[8/29/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
She just needed my perspective on stuff as a guy lol


[8/29/2023 10:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh I see I see


[8/29/2023 10:16 PM] sskarz
There’s this guy at her hospital and he’s a nurse that flirts with her, but she didn’t realize it till I pointed stuff out 😂


[8/29/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Awwwwwww omg


[8/29/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
I’m like: oh yeah of course he likes u, it’s textbook (me who didn’t know you liked me even from the most obvious shit in the world)


[8/29/2023 10:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Wait is she okay with you sharing?


[8/29/2023 10:17 PM] sskarz
Yeah this is our dynamic haha

[8/29/2023 10:18 PM] sskarz
So anyways yeah that’s basically how it went, and I was just like in my head, you know if I said this stuff to prabi, she would know I liked her right?


[8/29/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh my, if you let her reads out previous texts


[8/29/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
She would probably slap you as to why you didn’t realize before 😂

{Reactions}
😂 

[8/29/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
Like if I said: oh yeah I would’ve noticed you in a crowded room, do you think you would’ve known I liked you


[8/29/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
Omg we need to just never tell her ever about how I confessed


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
The way I would get laughed at for the rest of my life 💀


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
No once we tell we tell her all of it


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
I will at least if you don’t, yk


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
So she can laugh at you


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Typical sibling thing


[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
Oh noooooooooooo

[8/29/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s not, you are fine, it was the cutest thing


[8/29/2023 10:21 PM] sskarz

[8/29/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
I mean like a guy says that when they think you’re beautiful


[8/29/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
Not to compare heights 😂


[8/29/2023 10:22 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh do they? Yea that’s a pretty sweet thing to say tho


[8/29/2023 10:22 PM] sskarz
And the guy said that to swezna and she was like, is that flirting, so I wondered if I said that to u, would u think I was flirting with u


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Um, hmmmm, maybe yes


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
Just to see a girls perspective yk


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
ah okay okay


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] prabipyakurel
But it’s like maybe maybe


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
Yeah see that’s the thing 😂


[8/29/2023 10:23 PM] sskarz
As a guy, it’s obvious because that’s like textbook for flirting with a girl


[8/29/2023 10:24 PM] sskarz
But a girl wouldn’t be so sure


[8/29/2023 10:24 PM] sskarz
Pretty interesting actually


[8/29/2023 10:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmm you right you right, we’ll did he say anything else?


[8/29/2023 10:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe he likes her.


[8/29/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
In short yeah, which all from a guys perspective it looks like he likes her


[8/29/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
But she wasn’t so sure


[8/29/2023 10:25 PM] sskarz
He’s said and done stuff and I’m like, yeah I wouldn’t do that to any of my friends that are girls that I have no attraction to yk?


[8/29/2023 10:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhhh omg then maybe he likes her


[8/29/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Huh maybe we should tell her about us soon, just her tho


[8/29/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
Definitely does, to the point that MULTIPLE coworkers said it out loud to her face and she wasn’t convinced 😂


[8/29/2023 10:26 PM] sskarz
That’s all up to you


[8/29/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
She should look into it, but like I am no expert so tell her to be careful.


[8/29/2023 10:26 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean does she like the dude back in anyway?


[8/29/2023 10:27 PM] sskarz
No 💀

[8/29/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh I see, well there are ways to let boys down softly yk


[8/29/2023 10:27 PM] sskarz
I bet that the guy would confess or try a move in the next 2 weeks for sure


[8/29/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Possibly


[8/29/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
So glad I’m not on that end of the stick 🙏


[8/29/2023 10:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Or maybe he is shy like you and just like to annoy them with hints and stuff


[8/29/2023 10:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Ah no trust me you are fine, I am glad you aren’t the one I had to do that to.


[8/29/2023 10:28 PM] sskarz
Could be, but let’s be honest a 26 year old me would probably be a little more straight to the face than rn lol


[8/29/2023 10:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Anyone else that confesses, they will hear how I let them down.


[8/29/2023 10:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Dw you will get to that age too, we will see


[8/29/2023 10:29 PM] prabipyakurel

Would you rather live for eternity, or would you rather live for a shortened life


[8/29/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
I ask a lot of friends this question and the answers are always interesting


[8/29/2023 10:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Short normal like with the people I love (including you). I feel like what is the point of eternity when all you can find is in front of you. When you have people you love and friends around you, just a happy life to the fullest is the best. I would not want to live forever. Short and sweet, especially now that I have you.


[8/29/2023 10:46 PM] prabipyakurel
What about you?


[8/29/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
literally the exact same answer as you

[8/29/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
I wouldn’t change a thing, I’d rather spend my last days with you then to live eternally for nothing

Eternity is nothing without people you love

{Reactions}

[8/29/2023 10:47 PM] sskarz
There’s no point of living for eternity if for no emotions. Life is about feeling emotions, and once you take that away, there’s no more reason to live


[8/29/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
You won’t ever lose me, trust me

[8/29/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
Exactly how I feel, yea like people say you only live once for a reason.


[8/29/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
Yeah also what would you do if you lived for an eternity


[8/29/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
Like, you probably experienced everything the universe has to offer at some point


[8/29/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
If only I lived forever or others too?


[8/29/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
Just you


[8/29/2023 10:50 PM] prabipyakurel
No nothing, I wouldn’t do anything, I would think about everything I had and go insane thinking about it

[8/29/2023 10:53 PM] prabipyakurel
No I think about that too, I know you will always be with me, but with everything school wise that have been going well, I feel like it will all come down and hit me somewhere to the point where I won’t be able to pick my self up anymore.


[8/29/2023 10:53 PM] prabipyakurel
But dw no karma will come for you 🙏


[8/29/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz

how was your club meeting?


[8/30/2023 9:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Um it was like an info session for the Berkeley mock trial team, but I don’t think I have the mental power to take on that club now as a freshmen so it will be like a later thing.


[8/30/2023 9:17 PM] prabipyakurel
Also the auditions are this week and I chose to come to LA and see you instead of staying here for that audition.

[8/30/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
awww it's okay, you'll get your chance again


[8/30/2023 9:18 PM] sskarz
what is the berkeley mock trial team?


[8/30/2023 9:19 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s where you basically become attorneys and witnesses and perform a case given to you


[8/30/2023 9:19 PM] prabipyakurel
You compete and stuff


[8/30/2023 9:19 PM] sskarz
whaaaaaaaaaa that's so cool


[8/30/2023 9:19 PM] sskarz
and you're missing that to come to LA? Now I feel bad


[8/30/2023 9:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea the last thing I wanna do this year is put so much pressure on myself with everything else on top of it.


[8/30/2023 9:20 PM] sskarz
Yeah I guess that's true


[8/30/2023 9:20 PM] prabipyakurel
No no not at all, the time commitment is crazy too, I promise it’s not like that, it is the time commitment of a 4 unit course


[8/30/2023 9:20 PM] prabipyakurel
I can’t do that


[8/30/2023 9:20 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/30/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
ugh today was a sloggggggggggggggggggggggggg


[8/30/2023 9:22 PM] sskarz
so basically


[8/30/2023 9:23 PM] sskarz
i had a class at 11 am, and i had already done all the assignments for that day before the class so i did nothing in class. Then my next class was supposed to be at like 3, but that got cancelled. So I had to stay like 5 hours doing nothing to my next class, in which we did literally nothing in


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh damn


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] prabipyakurel
So it was just like a whatever type of day


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
yeah


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Maybe you hung out with friends tho during that time no


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
i have never been so unproductive expecting to be productive in my life lol


[8/30/2023 9:24 PM] sskarz
everyone was in class and there was no one 😭


[8/30/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
i just sat in the library listening to music and watching youtube


[8/30/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
Awwwww lol I would say you could have talked to me but I was also in class lolz


[8/30/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
So what time did you come home?


[8/30/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel
That’s a awkward feeling


[8/30/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
yeah haha, I was tempted to but again, I don't want to hinder your studies at all


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
really is, I just waited for something the entire day


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah you would never, I know you won’t!!!

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
and did nothing


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s okay tho, you gave yourself a free day


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
It is a day to clear your head


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
Think of it like that


[8/30/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
I know I know but I have respect for you and this is the promise I hold for you


[8/30/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
How can I clear my head if there was nothing there to begin with 😭


[8/30/2023 9:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Love you for that, same here, I promise to never get in your way, I will be in your heart for moral support.


[8/30/2023 9:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn, then it was a free day for you


[8/30/2023 9:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Think of it as a rest day after your time at the gym


[8/30/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
You will never get in my way ever love, but I appreciate you :)

You will probably make up for that time one day


[8/30/2023 9:30 PM] sskarz

[8/30/2023 9:30 PM] sskarz
I wish I just went home early and joined the class on zoom lol


[8/30/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
In my last class, I literally went to the back of the room and put my head down for 20 mins, I woke up and we were still on the same thing that I had already done


[8/30/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh I see, but it’s fine. You didn’t expect it and sometimes life does that


[8/30/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Yikes, but you had a good nap I suppose?


[8/30/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
my friend woke me up and I looked at the board, nothing had changed, put my head back down 😂

[8/30/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel
I got a lot of help during office hours, spent 35 min looking for the location but who is counting that, and for the actual math class I made a friend, in fact got her insta so we can communicate and I have a quiz tomorrow.

[8/30/2023 10:27 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/30/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
Ohhhh my family would take it to lengths and get an FBI investigation up in our relationship 😂


[8/30/2023 10:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh yikes 😂


[8/30/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
They would stay insistent on knowing everything from that point forward


[8/30/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
So yk it’s good it’s just us right now, let’s keep it that way so we have our own freedom with each other

[8/30/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
If I am getting a hug, I am getting one that is worth it. So we will have to do something.


[8/30/2023 10:41 PM] sskarz
I’ve got a few ideas


[8/30/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Go on


[8/30/2023 10:41 PM] sskarz
Okay first idea


[8/30/2023 10:42 PM] sskarz
I bring up the idea of showing you the car that I’m driving now, the Tesla, and we make an excuse to go outside and since you were so interested, you wanted to see it


[8/30/2023 10:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmm okay okay


[8/30/2023 10:42 PM] sskarz
Second idea


[8/30/2023 10:43 PM] sskarz
I know the layout of kreepas house somewhat, and I know that the second floor has a lot of rooms. We could just make an excuse to go talk upstairs


[8/30/2023 10:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Wait it is at their house?


[8/30/2023 10:43 PM] sskarz
I’m assuming so?


[8/30/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
Shit unless it’s not, then that idea won’t work


[8/30/2023 10:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Hmm not sure


[8/30/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
This is why I’ve thought of several 😂


[8/30/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
Third idea


[8/30/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
Uh


[8/30/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz
I’ll pull you to a room and lock it, if literally nothing else works for privacy


[8/30/2023 10:45 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea so the last 2 ideas are not going to work


[8/30/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz
Most likely not haha


[8/30/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz
I’ve got no idea what the venue is like either


[8/30/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
either at their house or some kind of dinner place


[8/30/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
but the first idea has some merit to it


[8/30/2023 10:46 PM] sskarz
You got any ideas?


[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
brother called and then mom called lol


[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
Haha no worries


[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
Also diamond bar, damn


[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] sskarz
we’ll pray the first idea works then haha


[8/30/2023 10:48 PM] prabipyakurel
The first idea might be it


[8/30/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Or I can leave something like lip gloss or something in my car and while I am getting that from dads car, you can come to check on your car or something a little after I get out


[8/30/2023 10:49 PM] sskarz
Ohh yeah that’s also a good one


[8/30/2023 10:49 PM] prabipyakurel
Watch my dad be like, why do you need to get more lip gloss


[8/30/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz
Now the thing is, since it’s a hall, we would have to be a little more discrete since it’s out in the open


[8/30/2023 10:50 PM] prabipyakurel
No fr, it is open open


[8/30/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz
I can just park in a dark corner, no one would see lol


[8/30/2023 10:50 PM] prabipyakurel
You need to find that parking first 😂


[8/30/2023 10:50 PM] sskarz
I’ll scout the place dw

{Reactions}

[8/30/2023 10:51 PM] prabipyakurel
I would say go to the little area to the bathroom and hug but I know there will be so many aunties there


[8/30/2023 10:51 PM] sskarz
Yeah that’s got lots of risks haha


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz
What if someone was in line for the bathroom and we both came out 💀


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz
Instant death


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh omg I don’t even want to imagine


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] prabipyakurel
No no


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Scratch that


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Burn that actually


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz
Mhmmm


[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz

[8/30/2023 10:52 PM] sskarz
It’s okay

[8/31/2023 8:04 AM] sskarz
Wbu?


[8/31/2023 8:04 AM] prabipyakurel
Nice nice


[8/31/2023 8:05 AM] prabipyakurel
Like after I was done texting you, it took me a while to fall asleep and my leg was hurting so bad, I couldn’t fall asleep until maybe 1. But after that was okay, I just got up in the morning.


[8/31/2023 8:05 AM] sskarz
Why was your leg hurting so badly?


[8/31/2023 8:06 AM] prabipyakurel
I have no idea honestly, but it was just my right one and like nothing would help


[8/31/2023 8:06 AM] sskarz
It just like started hurting for no reason?


[8/31/2023 8:06 AM] sskarz
Maybe it was a muscle spasm or something


[8/31/2023 8:07 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea possibly, but it was like kind of annoying because I couldn’t stop moving me feet.


[8/31/2023 8:07 AM] prabipyakurel
Then I got up and pressed it for a little and it slightly went away and I think I slept after that.


[8/31/2023 8:07 AM] prabipyakurel
But I am all good now.


[8/31/2023 8:08 AM] sskarz
Okay that’s good to hear


[8/31/2023 8:08 AM] sskarz

[8/31/2023 8:14 AM] prabipyakurel
I mean if you did it carefully the first time it wouldn’t have defeated you and you could have been texting me sitting on that thing, but no, it is you that put the washer in wrong and messed it up.

It was pretty good, had probably the hardest workout I’ve ever done today which felt amazing afterwards, walked into class and finished the in class assignment and walked out in 10 mins, then went to sams club with my sister and bugged her for 2 hours, came back and got tikka lol

I would not say overwhelmed, its just I had my first quiz, first assigned project, and lots of reading, maybe like a lot on my plate would be the phrase


[8/31/2023 8:31 PM] prabipyakurel
But I got most of them over with so its just the dance as of now


[8/31/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
yeah its a lot to take in, its still just your second week of college and you're already off to do so many things at once, I bet it feels really exhausting to think of everything at once


[8/31/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea it feel like I have been here for months ngl


[8/31/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
hey do you remember a while back when you went to the gym at like 10:00


[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
when you hadnt confessed yet.


[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
Yeah?


[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
And you sent me a picture

[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
Oh yeah


[8/31/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
Yeah I do


[8/31/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Okay so after a little while, you said "can I ask why you dont want to hang out", were you mad at during that time.


[8/31/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel
It has just always been in my mind


[8/31/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
No no I wasn’t mad, I was honestly just confused. It was during a time I felt the most confused with how you felt about me and I just wanted to know why you were feeling that way


[8/31/2023 9:34 PM] sskarz
So after that conversation, I took a step back and reflected upon it


[8/31/2023 9:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhh I see, yea you were like "come to the gym I will show you everyhting you need to know" and I was like omg damn. And then you said that and I was like "oh no, what if he is like mad at me or something"


[8/31/2023 9:36 PM] sskarz
No no, it’s just at the time I was thinking back to when you didn’t want to hangout initially is when it was bogging my mind down. And I just needed to know why is all


[8/31/2023 9:36 PM] sskarz
Trust me I don’t get mad easily haha, I ask honest questions and then I’ll decide if it’s right to be mad


[8/31/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Gotcha, no no you it was right for you to ask me lol, everyime someone asks to like go here or lets go there, I am always like, "yea in the future"


[8/31/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel
No I love you for that.


[8/31/2023 9:37 PM] prabipyakurel

[8/31/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
Yeah I got you, I’ve done the same thing to other friends and I’ve gotten that answer so I’ve always just stepped back and kind of backed off just to analyze the situation


[8/31/2023 9:38 PM] sskarz
Awwww thank you, I wasn’t going to send it to you initially but I felt like eh, might as well


[8/31/2023 9:38 PM] prabipyakurel
No I am glad you did, it was nice!


[8/31/2023 9:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea and I was scared that you were going to ask me to go somewhere and I would have to turn you down because my parents will not be okay, especially that time when I didnt know you liked me.


[8/31/2023 9:39 PM] sskarz
Yeah I realized what I was asking for wasn’t realistic so I let it go


[8/31/2023 9:39 PM] prabipyakurel

I went to a MESA conference in San Diego with my friend Anthony and it’s basically a place where you meet company representatives and whatever and it was all sponsored for us to go right. We were there for like 3 days, and Anthony and I shared a hotel room with 2 beds right. Every single morning, I would literally have my alarms ring and he got tired of my shit one time and literally turned off all of my alarms so he could go back to sleep 😭


[9/1/2023 8:16 AM] prabipyakurel
Omg what a friend.

[9/1/2023 8:23 AM] sskarz
They got their circadian rhythm down right


[9/1/2023 8:23 AM] prabipyakurel
That is my brother, he sleeps through the alarms, and when his school started a week before I came here, that kid would set and alarm to wake up at 5:30 and I would have to go shut that think up and slap some sense into him

I thought you would be there and you weren’t and I was like damn. Then your dad was like next time you go over to ours when parents go somewhere and you can hang out with them and I was like “maybe that day will come”

[9/2/2023 11:55 PM] sskarz
Hey, I hope you read this in the morning and not tonight, I want you to get good sleep, you just travelled a long way and you’re most definitely tired, so if you see this before you sleep, put the phone down, go to bed, and then read the next in the morning. Please.

I haven’t been able to sleep at all, and I can’t until I say some things. First of all, tonight was amazing. Seeing you again really made me have butterflies in my stomach and you looked stunning as always. So thank you, for being there, it was really nice seeing you again.

Before I get to my point of this entire message, please understand that I’m not mad at all, and I wasn’t at all at any point during tonight. I had lots of fun! It’s just that I feel conflicted, in a way that you probably didn’t know.

Going into this party, my entire reasoning behind being excited for tonight was to see you, and that was fulfilled for me. And before the party for the entire week, we’ve both been talking about how excited we were to see each other and what we would do if opportunities had ever risen for the both of us to be isolated from the rest. 

When I texted you to come outside, I saw that as our one opportunity to actually be able to talk to each other properly. And looking back on this, I wish I hadn’t. I’m really, deeply, sorry if it made you super uncomfortable. At that moment, I could tell you were extremely nervous and anxious about doing that thing, and I’m so so sorry. It’s my fault and I should’ve realized this sooner instead of trying to remedy it. Please understand that if I had known before hand about how you were going to react, I never would have brought you out. For that, I am so sorry. 

My only expectation when it came to seeing you outside was to have a nice hug with you. If you thought I had other intentions, please understand that I only wanted the hug that I promised. We’re so new into this relationship that I don’t want to rush things that don’t need rushing. I love you for you, for who you are as a person, and nothing will change that. 

I remember that you also wanted to hug, and so that’s the only thing I wanted too. I also recognize that this is your first time doing anything like this with a guy and I get it. But, your reaction threw me off, and it’s not your fault, but it kind of messed with me tonight. 

A part of me is regretful for doing that in the first place, but another part of me is left wondering how I should act with you from here on out. I really wasn’t expecting the reaction from you, but again it’s justified for the way that I also acted. We’re both not sure of the next time we’ll see each other again, so I wanted tonight to be special for the two of us. It sounds selfish I know, but all I wanted was to embrace you in a nice hug, especially since I’ve got no idea if the next time I’ll see you is in a few months or an entire year, which is why I feel so conflicted in the first place. It’s not your fault, it’s just that I’m going to seriously miss you.

Again, I’m not mad at all, trust me you’ve gotta do something terrible to make me mad even one bit. But I, my heart, is confused of what to think about tonight, as great as it was. And I just needed to get this off my chest so I can sleep. 

I still love you, as much as I did before this entire event, and never get that twisted. You make my world go round some days, and I can’t thank you enough for that. But I’m also an honest person, that wants to be open about his feelings, and I just wanted to share this with you. I love you ❤️

Hey, I know you told me to read this in the morning but I read it now and I am not asleep yet either, sorry if I am disturbing you. Seeing you today was magical and as much as I tried to keep it hidden, there were so many times where I kept glancing at you. When you made me feel better about going up to dance while I was nervous and supported me. Trust me I still had butterflies and could not believe I was seeing you. When you called me outside, I was ready. But then I stepped outside and saw some uncles that I know that were in the group. But let me tell you, when you brought me to your car and gave me the first glance, I was just frozen, you were so handsome and looked really nice. But I was hesitating because the uncles was walking back and fourth up and down the parking lot. And when you pulled me in for a hug, you don’t even know how much I wanted to just stay in that position and for the time to freeze. And you don’t ever need to act differently forward me, just talk to me and see me the same way you see me now. And I didn’t get inside the car with you because I was afraid that someone (possibly your family) would come to get you or ask you something and we would be caught getting out. when we talked that time, I was so happy. Yes I was scared as hell and so anxious, but then I held your hands and it felt so good and so safe. Don’t apologize, going outside was not a mistake and I should be the one apologizing, I made it so awkward and I am so sorry about that. Just know that after that interaction, I felt so alive and so excited and that meet with you made my night.


[9/3/2023 12:38 AM] prabipyakurel
I am sorry if anything I did made you feel that way. I am so in love with you and will forever be. For the record you are a gentlemen and I would never question your intentions with me. I knew I was going for a hug, and I freaked out when I got out there. But after you did hug me and talked to me, I started to feel better. I wanted to talk a little more but I just know either my mom if not my brother would come looking for me and everyone would have been looking for me. And once again I know you told me not to read your text, but I did love. I hope that this doesn’t change anything about us in anyway. I loved seeing you dance and just dancing on the dance floor with you. I could not have asked for a better night. Love you so much!


[9/3/2023 12:52 AM] prabipyakurel
Also sorry for messaging you late into the night, I love you, please don’t feel like I am drifting away from you. You have all of my heart. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

But I am extremely sorry for making you feel that way yesterday, I was truly happy, I was scared in the beginning that someone was going to catch us, because I was afraid of loosing you and just wanted us safe, however when you held my hand, I am telling you it was so amazing and I felt like I was winning in life when I said bye.


[9/3/2023 7:06 AM] prabipyakurel
Also I would have started crying if I kept staring at you because seeing you up close made me realize how hard it will be for me to not kiss you from all the at over there.

Oh yeah, my morning started off on a very interesting note


[9/3/2023 3:11 PM] sskarz
I woke up, texted you, went downstairs and my mom and sister were talking and then I noticed, and then we started talking about last night. The first topic was: oh you remembered Prabi right? Are you interested in her? And I was like uhhhhhhh everyone let’s all relax for a bit here I just woke up 😭


[9/3/2023 3:12 PM] sskarz
I said yeah a part of me is interested and then my mom was like, well why don’t you guys talk more, get her number or something and I was like YO CHILLLLLLL


[9/3/2023 3:12 PM] sskarz
Basically I had to deflect the conversation by saying there’s no way I’d be able to talk to her consistently when she’s studying like crazy and I can’t be a nuisance


[9/3/2023 3:12 PM] prabipyakurel
That is so sweet, i love how i am a topic in your family so much.


[9/3/2023 3:13 PM] prabipyakurel
There were so many other people, they didnt ask if you were interested in them lol.


[9/3/2023 3:13 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/3/2023 3:13 PM] prabipyakurel

Or after the party


[9/3/2023 3:20 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/3/2023 3:20 PM] sskarz
what would you have done differently?


[9/3/2023 3:21 PM] prabipyakurel
Well I would have taken a deep breath and focused on you rather than think about getting caught


[9/3/2023 3:21 PM] prabipyakurel
And held your hand longer, hugged you longer, just stay there smiling at you longer


[9/3/2023 3:22 PM] sskarz

No Yea I am only going to remember when you told me how beautiful I looked and when you hugged me.


[9/3/2023 3:23 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea I realized that I was not the best when I went outside, but it was because I was just nervous, and I love you so much.


[9/3/2023 3:24 PM] sskarz
I also just put you on the spot without consulting with you first, I could’ve gone about that better


[9/3/2023 3:24 PM] sskarz
It’s not your fault


[9/3/2023 3:25 PM] sskarz
Regardless, I got to see your smile with my own eyes, and that’s all I needed


[9/3/2023 3:25 PM] prabipyakurel
No no, we are going to do it better next time.


[9/3/2023 3:25 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/3/2023 3:42 PM] sskarz
Good thing you pulled away then lol

No no, it would have been happy tears


[9/3/2023 3:42 PM] prabipyakurel
I kinda wish I didnt.


[9/3/2023 3:43 PM] sskarz
It’s life, we all go through things we didn’t think we would and wish for better outcomes or something like that

I’m okay with how everything went


[9/3/2023 3:44 PM] prabipyakurel
No I was really happy, it was a good feeling.


[9/3/2023 3:45 PM] prabipyakurel
I just want to hold your hands again, honestly i was so excited about seeing you and being around you, i didnt really think about how it would feel like shit leaving you and going away again.


[9/3/2023 3:45 PM] sskarz
Hey it’s okay, it only feels like this right now. We will both be fine

[9/3/2023 3:51 PM] sskarz
I’m not giving up ever


[9/3/2023 3:51 PM] prabipyakurel
No fr, I would always be like, I am always in a long distance because I was single, but i guess i know how it feels now.


[9/3/2023 3:52 PM] prabipyakurel
I will do whatever it takes, the distance is only little right now, sooner or later we will get past that stage.


[9/3/2023 3:53 PM] sskarz
Yeah you’re right, even if it takes years, I swear to you I’m staying with you

[9/3/2023 3:55 PM] sskarz
No matter what


[9/3/2023 3:56 PM] sskarz
I’ll make every excuse in the world to see you again


[9/3/2023 3:56 PM] prabipyakurel
I will probably be here in december.


[9/3/2023 3:57 PM] prabipyakurel
I have to, no you are not going to come get me like that.


[9/3/2023 3:57 PM] sskarz
I wouldn’t bring you back with me, I’d just visit


[9/3/2023 3:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Its not like "mom imma go get milk from this one store in the bay area"


[9/3/2023 3:57 PM] prabipyakurel
But still, what would you say?


[9/3/2023 3:57 PM] sskarz
I’ll tell the most scandalous lies if that’s what it takes


[9/3/2023 3:58 PM] sskarz
I’d figure something out


[9/3/2023 3:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Well If I dont come in december, which is unlikely, I will let you know.


[9/3/2023 3:58 PM] prabipyakurel
We will video call but you are not going to waste 7 hours driving to see me.


[9/3/2023 3:59 PM] sskarz
I just might, and what would you do if I did?


[9/3/2023 3:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Hug you because I dont care if anyone there sees me


[9/3/2023 3:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Hold hands


[9/3/2023 3:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Talk a lot


[9/3/2023 3:59 PM] prabipyakurel
Take you to eat somewhere


[9/3/2023 4:00 PM] sskarz
Hey can you promise me something? I know this sounds kind of selfish


[9/3/2023 4:00 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm


[9/3/2023 4:01 PM] sskarz
Can we have a proper date when that time comes? No sneaking around at functions and being afraid we might get caught. I just want you for a day, just to myself


[9/3/2023 4:01 PM] prabipyakurel
I promise, when that time comes, we will go on a proper day where you can have me just for yourself.


[9/3/2023 4:01 PM] prabipyakurel

I just wanted to hear you also wanting the same thing


[9/3/2023 4:03 PM] prabipyakurel
What what do you mean it sounds selfish, its not selfish at all, you are such a gentleman and so lovable.


[9/3/2023 4:04 PM] sskarz
It’s my selfish desire


[9/3/2023 4:04 PM] sskarz
Something that I keep to myself as a reminder for why I work so hard

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/3/2023 4:06 PM] prabipyakurel
I love your desire, its not selfish at all. And sometimes I think about how you love me so much and like go to school early and all just so you can call me and we met yesterday and I literally left you, I feel like I am not able to give you the same back.


[9/3/2023 4:07 PM] sskarz
That’s not the same thing at all, I know you tried your best for what you felt at that moment. And it’s okay

[9/3/2023 4:08 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/3/2023 4:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Um so you know how like a while back when we were talking about like people on the road that run into the car for money, Yea and you metioned that your tesla has a camera everywhere, when we met near your car, that wasnt recorded or anything right.


[9/3/2023 4:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Sorry i was just thinking about it.


[9/3/2023 4:11 PM] sskarz
I made sure before hand that the feature was turned off


[9/3/2023 4:11 PM] sskarz

No one even suspected I was out anyways


[9/3/2023 4:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Mmmm yea the moment I walked in my brother made eye contact with me, I ran into him at the door because he was looking for me to use my phone to take a picture of something.


[9/3/2023 4:13 PM] prabipyakurel
Thats good.


[9/3/2023 4:13 PM] sskarz
Then what we did was in perfect timing


[9/3/2023 4:13 PM] sskarz
Had it gone any longer, maybe it would’ve been way worse


[9/3/2023 4:14 PM] prabipyakurel
I guess so, but I loved it.


[9/3/2023 4:14 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/3/2023 4:16 PM] prabipyakurel
When we see each other again, we will sneak out again if we have to.


[9/3/2023 4:16 PM] sskarz
Honey, I don’t want to…


[9/3/2023 4:16 PM] prabipyakurel
No sometimes it might be the only alone time i might get with you


[9/3/2023 4:17 PM] sskarz
If I’m going to spend time with you, it needs to be without the burden of us getting into trouble


[9/3/2023 4:17 PM] sskarz
I’m sorry, but this is the only way


[9/3/2023 4:17 PM] sskarz
I can’t risk something like that again


[9/3/2023 4:17 PM] prabipyakurel
No I see, I get that, yea it is more comfortable when we dont have to look over our shoulders.

[9/4/2023 5:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I didnt  want him to know that we talked because then the next time we were brought up (which we were brought up frequently whenever they saw you anywhere), he would have been like, ooooooooo yea they talk all the time, and then my family would be like, why? what do you talk about?


[9/4/2023 6:00 PM] sskarz

[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] sskarz
Oooo wouldn’t that be a little revealing for anyone paying close attention?


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] sskarz
They would instantly know 💀


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Who would pay close attention?


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn, you play riddles with them too.


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] sskarz
I mean true, but no one probably will


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] prabipyakurel
No one will


[9/5/2023 8:19 PM] sskarz
No no, they just know bad writing and me are quite affiliated haha


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhh but seriously that was so cute


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
i mean it wasnt the hardest riddle


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
it toook me 5 minutes


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] sskarz
Well you didn’t solve it in the way I intended 😭


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
but it was the best trying to figure that out and how to tell you ofc


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
But I solved it


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
you made it so clear with the last sentence


[9/5/2023 8:20 PM] prabipyakurel
And I mentioned that to you


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] prabipyakurel
thee means you


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] prabipyakurel
"the letter that spelled you"


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] sskarz
I just wanted it to rhyme 😭


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] prabipyakurel
it was in front of my face


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] sskarz
I had no idea it meant you 💀


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] prabipyakurel
well it served both purposes


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] sskarz
I’m such a dumbass hahahaha


[9/5/2023 8:21 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/5/2023 8:22 PM] sskarz
I’m going to be yours forever


[9/5/2023 8:23 PM] prabipyakurel
I was ready for you to be like, well this girl (girls name) is blah blah blah.


[9/5/2023 8:23 PM] prabipyakurel
Correct!


[9/5/2023 8:24 PM] sskarz
Literally that would’ve just been impossible for you to figure out, I wouldn’t even have bothered going through all that riddle trouble 😂


[9/5/2023 8:24 PM] sskarz
But it was you and I was unsure of how you felt at the time so I did something stupid and made a stupidly easy riddle haha


[9/5/2023 8:24 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea when you wouldnt give up the name I had a feeling either i knew the person or it was me.


[9/5/2023 8:25 PM] prabipyakurel
It was so amazing, I will remember the night you sent it and solved it both.


[9/5/2023 8:25 PM] sskarz
There’s no one better than you so that possibility was never going to be true anyway


[9/5/2023 8:25 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea there was no name on that riddle.


[9/5/2023 8:25 PM] prabipyakurel
There is no boy out there that deserves a place in ly life other than you and you remember that.

and i was like okay, either he is going to tell me its me, or i will slowly move away from him.


[9/5/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
Hahaha well it must’ve gave you some piece of mind


[9/5/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
Oh thank god I confessed early


[9/5/2023 8:27 PM] prabipyakurel
It hit me, when you sent that, a part of my brain went, "omg he likes me"


[9/5/2023 8:27 PM] prabipyakurel
No I am glad you did, because a week after that, I saw you in person.


[9/5/2023 8:28 PM] sskarz
uh, you got a dependent clause

[9/5/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
so the sentence before the comma is fine that’s an independent clause, but after the comma is when that dependent clause starts but never ends properly, thus making it an incomplete sentence


[9/5/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks professor thapa, I will note that down.


[9/5/2023 8:29 PM] sskarz
there we go, now it’s fixed 😂


[9/5/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/6/2023 8:03 PM] prabipyakurel
My day was nice, I attended office hours for math, reviewed a little for tomorrow's quiz, then went to the math lecture and came back, pretty much it.


[9/6/2023 8:03 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[9/6/2023 8:03 PM] sskarz

[9/6/2023 8:05 PM] sskarz
yeah so basically, after my boring english class in which i napped for a bit (jk jk, just boring), went to the library and chilled out for 3 hours and had lunch, then had another class that was interesting and difficult math stuff, but i was expecting my lsat class to be a total snore


[9/6/2023 8:05 PM] sskarz
this last class that i had, it's been SO boring the last 3 weeks right


[9/6/2023 8:06 PM] sskarz
today, my professor didn't change anything, except there were like 5 students that didn't do the stuff from last class, or not properly anyway for the setup for today's class, so the class was just recapping for them. Why? Because my teacher is super slow, and he has a THICK asian accent and people can't understand him really and it made for the most hilarious moments today


[9/6/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz
My professor got so fed up of trying to help these students navigate their computer, he started yelling and laughing at them, and my friend and i were DYING in the front row of class


[9/6/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz
we laughed so hard we started crying because it was that hilarious


[9/6/2023 8:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn, what a professor, i mean if he had a thick asian accent and started yelling and laughing at the same time, I would be laughing too.


[9/6/2023 8:08 PM] prabipyakurel
You should have taken a picture of yourself, you probably looked so dumb crying while laughing

{Reactions}
😂 

[9/6/2023 8:08 PM] prabipyakurel
but that feeling is good yk


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] sskarz
im not lying prabi, we had an hour and a half for class. the stuff we did today would've took MAX 20 minutes if everyone just did it on their own


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] prabipyakurel
omg


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] prabipyakurel
damn


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] sskarz

{Reactions}
😂 

[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] sskarz
no like


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] sskarz
i was so hyped for this class


[9/6/2023 8:09 PM] sskarz
because its supposed to be a lot of teamwork, and like we are all supposed to work on a singular project the entire semester to then present it at the end


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] sskarz
we haven't, even made groups yet


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] sskarz
and its been 3 WEEKS


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] sskarz
i've got no faith in this professor


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
that is fr so slow


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] sskarz
😂


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
But it seemed like you had a fun class tho


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
thanks to those 5 students


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] sskarz
for once, yeah i felt kinda bad afterwards, i didn't want them to think that i was laughing at them


[9/6/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
well they probably did idiot


[9/6/2023 8:11 PM] sskarz
but i was just laughing at the fact that the professor started getting frustrated hahaha


[9/6/2023 8:11 PM] sskarz
eh it is what it is


[9/6/2023 8:11 PM] prabipyakurel
lol no i was kidding, no they probably understood why you were dying there


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
i showed my professor the work for the class, and he was like, alright for those of you that already did this stuff, leave and those that haven't stay


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
and i just left out the door in like 30 minutes


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Genius


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
its probably gonna be an easy A, but i won't learn anything in there


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
meh its alright, just go with the flow.


[9/6/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
its the most basic shit prabi, i have 3rd year compsci majors in my class that don't know how to navigate a macbook 😭


[9/6/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/6/2023 8:15 PM] sskarz
my friend norma and i were just laughing so hard, and even the professor was like, "stop laughing!" and he kept on laughing


[9/6/2023 8:15 PM] prabipyakurel

Ahh yikes, no some stories are really good, but its just the ending that messes with me sometimes yk


[9/6/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
awwww you are the sweetest person ever, lol it would be a win win for me too.


[9/6/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
no yeahhhh, well since we probably won't watch it together soon, its about a guy and a girl that meet and fall out of love through crazy action events, and they start to learn how to live with each other's feelings. Except the story takes place in a cyberpunk universe and the main protaganist does anything for the security of his love, so he sacrifices himself for her safety


[9/6/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
in the end anyway


[9/6/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
it made me full on cry


[9/6/2023 8:55 PM] sskarz
i remember watching the ending and i had so many tears running down 😂


[9/6/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
oh damn, no thats kinda sad. I have watched a lot of movies when someone dies and I have to look away from the TV so I dont cry like crazy


[9/6/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
I would sacrifice myself for my love any day, anytime and do anything.

so, before I graduated like during prom week, in our AP government class, everyone was talking about who they were going to prom with and then when they asked me I was like "uh dont know, dont really like anyone, and I told them I would probably go alone. And then my ap government teacher was all like Prabi it may not seem like you like anyone now, but trust me when you go to berkeley you will find a nepali boy just for you, and I thought she was crazy for thinking I would be dating someone right after high school. But being here with you and talking to you and falling in love with you has really been willd and been so amazing.

[9/7/2023 8:25 AM] sskarz

[9/7/2023 8:26 AM] prabipyakurel

Well I fell asleep around 11:00 but like strangely woke up at exactly 3:11 because I remember the time very well. Like I just woke up and was like, I just can't go back to sleep now, I was really going to go down from my bunk bed at 3:11 Am and go brush and everything. I just had like the most energy for like 30 minutes. But lol I didnt do that, I passed out the next second.


[9/7/2023 8:31 AM] sskarz

[9/7/2023 8:32 AM] prabipyakurel

[9/7/2023 8:33 AM] sskarz
Really?


[9/7/2023 8:33 AM] prabipyakurel
not to you but to one of my friends


[9/7/2023 8:33 AM] sskarz
Oh okay


[9/7/2023 8:37 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea so, what happened was after I was done texting you, it was like a week after july 4th, and it was a wednesday or something and I had a dream that there were people and dogs chasing me down the street and every house that I would go to the doors would not open and like I was just panicking and running. But then I tripped or something and woke up. I was so scared, I could not even get up to turn on the light. I had never felt that way before, so like I opened discord and realized that one of my friends saira would normally be up past 12, so I messaged her like an entire paragraph and told her to just talk to me because I was really scared. But then after like 5 minutes of sending that, I just deleted the message, I didnt want to disturb her. Then I put together the courage to walk down the hall to my parents and went there to "drink water" because they have a water jug. And my dad was like, did you have a nightmare, and I just talked to them a little bit (not about the nightmare) just general, and it felt better.


[9/7/2023 8:38 AM] prabipyakurel
I still remember that night, it was pretty scary, I didnt know what to do.


[9/7/2023 8:38 AM] sskarz
Omg that does sound really terrifying


[9/7/2023 8:38 AM] sskarz
Well if that happens again, don’t be afraid to text me, you can text me and call me whenever you need to

Hahaha it’s really not that complicated lol


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
I think the reason people think like that about android is because there are so many more options to do stuff that it gets overwhelming


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
No its not, but I have been so used to apple, and some android phones are actually confusing believe me


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea maybe


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
iPhone is definitely simpler to use


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
That’s why many people like it


[9/7/2023 9:32 PM] sskarz
Just for that reason


[9/7/2023 9:33 PM] sskarz
But I’m a tech nerd so I gotta try out everything


[9/7/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel

Make sure you’re fed first


[9/8/2023 4:27 PM] sskarz
Then take it


[9/8/2023 4:27 PM] sskarz
With appropriate doses, and then drink tons of water


[9/8/2023 4:27 PM] sskarz
That should help with some of the pain


[9/8/2023 4:27 PM] prabipyakurel
Am I supposed to take that with food?


[9/8/2023 4:27 PM] prabipyakurel
I just eat it alone sometimes

Hey love, just letting you know that I am feeling a whole lot better now. I fell asleep on the car ride to my cousins place and I think I just needed a nap and water. It doesn’t hurt anymore and I think it’s also because I might have slept in a weird position last night.

Hey hey, I know you probably can’t reply to this right now, but I’m gonna go to sleep now. Oh before that, yeah my day was pretty good, it’s been busy but the pooja finished! It was about Laxmi Aarit, figured that out lol. Or not, idk you can tell me if I’m an idiot for saying that haha. I got tikka on my face and now I’m up here, everyone is dancing downstairs but honestly I’m super tired so I’m about to pass out with some music, maybe put on a vinyl or something. But yeah, apart from that, my day just went like that. Hopefully your day is going better, and your stomach problems don’t come back. I know you’re eating the best Nepali food rn, and having a blast so keep on going!! I love you so much, and I’ll talk to you tomorrow! Good night, sweet dreams, love you!!! ❤️

[9/8/2023 10:02 PM] prabipyakurel

You could’ve been caught up in the wave


[9/10/2023 8:16 AM] prabipyakurel
Most likely, like yesterday morning it wasn’t bad, but like in the afternoon, even though my windows were closed, I needed to put on a jacket because I felt cold, I think that’s when it really kind of started


[9/10/2023 8:16 AM] sskarz
flu season is coming up too so that is also probably the reason


[9/10/2023 8:17 AM] sskarz
But hey, keep yourself warm and drink lots of water, and take medicine if you can and rest for today


[9/10/2023 8:17 AM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 12:16 PM] prabipyakurel
and if you get caught laughing at your mom when she is mad, she automatically start with, "i carried you for 9 months, and you are going to laugh at me and take your dads side"


[9/10/2023 12:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 12:32 PM] sskarz
make ur goal like to finish one of the bottles filled with water per day


[9/10/2023 12:32 PM] sskarz
that's still less than recommended, but it should help you like get used to drinking more water everyday


[9/10/2023 12:32 PM] prabipyakurel
I am trying, I used to come back home from school with like half the water still remaining sometimes


[9/10/2023 12:32 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:19 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:19 PM] prabipyakurel
your know your way around your family and know how to slightly fool mine


[9/10/2023 6:19 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:22 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:30 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:30 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:30 PM] prabipyakurel
yea


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] sskarz
wow this is much harder than i anticipated lol


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] prabipyakurel
it is


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] prabipyakurel
especially with me lol


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] prabipyakurel
my parents are like strict strict


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] sskarz
ok but how about this, ballsy play here


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] sskarz
but what if i was the one that met up with your parents?


[9/10/2023 6:31 PM] sskarz
but yk, we're just friends and all


[9/10/2023 6:32 PM] sskarz
because they know me, and they might just think we'd  be hanging out


[9/10/2023 6:32 PM] prabipyakurel
wait like we told them you randomly will be going to the same place?


[9/10/2023 6:32 PM] sskarz
yeah


[9/10/2023 6:32 PM] sskarz
so like if you were heading to a park, like just say i invited you


[9/10/2023 6:33 PM] sskarz
would they be suspicious?


[9/10/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel
so here is the thing, you would have to act like you want to go somewhere where my parents wont


[9/10/2023 6:33 PM] prabipyakurel
and then you gotta bring it up at random and be like, "maybe prabi wants to go.


[9/10/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
and then ask me if i like roller coasters and stuff


[9/10/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
possibly


[9/10/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
they will say yea she is also crazy and we are not going with her


[9/10/2023 6:34 PM] sskarz
wait like ask you over text and then u show them the texts?


[9/10/2023 6:34 PM] prabipyakurel
no not texts


[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel
this has to happen when we actually meet once and then from that point forward, they wont really question if i go out with you


[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel
i assume


[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
ohhhhhhhhhh


[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz
so if we were at an event


[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:35 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:36 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:37 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/10/2023 6:37 PM] prabipyakurel
I had to pretend like I had not seen your status for a second


[9/10/2023 6:38 PM] sskarz

[9/10/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
i guarantee it


[9/10/2023 6:40 PM] sskarz (pinned)
so there are 2 criteria here:
1. Your parents need to be okay with you being somewhere knowing or without knowing that I'm there, whatever suits that condition better
2. Your brother must be isolated from the plan of you and I meeting


[9/10/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
there you go


[9/10/2023 6:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Pinned a message.

[9/12/2023 8:28 AM] sskarz

[9/12/2023 8:28 AM] prabipyakurel
So I had like 5 dreams, all of which were kind of really weird


[9/12/2023 8:29 AM] prabipyakurel
um the first one was about this family where apparently a little boy got run over by a car and I woke up right after but it felt real


[9/12/2023 8:29 AM] prabipyakurel
and then I had a dream that I almost got hit by a car but got yelled at for standing in the way


[9/12/2023 8:29 AM] prabipyakurel
yea after those 2, I couldnt really sleep, it was around 3-4


[9/12/2023 8:30 AM] prabipyakurel
I got really scared for a while, and watched insta for a few minutes to calm myself down


[9/12/2023 8:30 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea I fell asleep for a little more around 6


[9/12/2023 8:30 AM] prabipyakurel
and got up around 7:30


[9/12/2023 8:31 AM] sskarz
Oh wow, that sounds terrifying


[9/12/2023 8:31 AM] sskarz
Are you sure you got enough sleep?


[9/12/2023 8:31 AM] prabipyakurel

[9/12/2023 8:31 AM] prabipyakurel
I am fine, I feel good right now


[9/12/2023 8:32 AM] prabipyakurel

My day was kinda fast, honestly the first 2 classes were simple, got help on timeline project in office hours a bit more, instead of going to English office hours I went to a zoom office hours for math and it was helpful. I ended the day with my history class which was just normal as always. Had a sandwich for dinner and now I am just sitting.


[9/12/2023 7:31 PM] prabipyakurel

Now that I think about it, idk if there are any Nepali people that we know that are dating another Nepali person.


[9/12/2023 8:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Or is it just me


[9/12/2023 8:12 PM] sskarz
actually


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
that's true


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
wow


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
I never thought about it like that


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
No I just thought about it too


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
nothing is coming to mind, not a single nepali person i know is dating a nepali person


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
mind blown


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean maybe they have dated or are dating non Nepali people but I can’t think of any either


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
you know, let me tell you something


[9/12/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz
i'm so glad i'm with you


[9/12/2023 8:14 PM] sskarz
because our cultures match


[9/12/2023 8:14 PM] sskarz
because let me tell you, dating someone of a different culture, is so wack


[9/12/2023 8:14 PM] sskarz
with you, we both know how to speak and do nepali things, and it is just so much better this way

{Reactions}

[9/12/2023 8:16 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg you don’t even know, a few years before I met you I am like there is really no perfect Nepali boy here for me and I thought it would be really hard to find anyone, lol who knew you and me were waiting to happen. I am so happy that I am dating a Nepali person, it hits different when you can talk shit about someone in a different language and eat amazing Nepali food without being like “you like it”. I can’t even imagine dating someone that isn’t Nepali tbh, just never been on my mind.

It’s one of the reason I wanted to wait to find the right one and not end up dating some white dude because for me I always knew something would not work out.

[9/12/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
Okay


[9/12/2023 9:05 PM] prabipyakurel
So I am not, at least I don’t think so, but the last time


[9/12/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
I went to the doctors and it showed that my blood level was pretty low, I was on iron pills for like 2 months but now I assume it’s fine


[9/12/2023 9:06 PM] prabipyakurel
Last time I checked it was not the best but it’s at a good level


[9/12/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
oh okay


[9/12/2023 9:06 PM] sskarz
no you're probably not anemic, just was low for a little


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea that’s probably what it was


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh the way my mom made me drink water, juice, and made so much saag so it would go back up


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
I had beet root juice


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
That thing is like 🤢


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] sskarz
omg but that's good, you probably avoided becoming anemic


[9/12/2023 9:07 PM] prabipyakurel
Trust me coffee and soda was off limits for a long time


[9/12/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
haha yeah i get that


[9/12/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea, lol mom be moms, I love them


[9/12/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Are you?


[9/12/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
i just ask if you're anemic because i am


[9/12/2023 9:08 PM] sskarz
and i have a rare case of anemia called thalassemia


[9/12/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
its chronic and genetic, but nothing dangerous


[9/12/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
it just means i have less hemoglobin than the average person


[9/12/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
so i get tired easier


[9/12/2023 9:09 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see, yea take care of yourself. I appreciate you sharing though.


[9/12/2023 9:09 PM] sskarz
oh and its not like a severe case at all


[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz

[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh ok ok


[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
its pretty minor


[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz
but just something i thought you should know


[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel
No because my dads hemoglobin level dropped and that had problems so just stay safe Sanskar, take care of yourself and don’t take in too much work.


[9/12/2023 9:10 PM] prabipyakurel

also, a completely unrelated note but another reason i asked


[9/12/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
if two people are anemic, they can't have children


[9/12/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
not related at all, but just something interesting


[9/12/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Damn


[9/12/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
yeah


[9/12/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm okay nice to know


[9/12/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
unfortunately its genetic


[9/12/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
so my kids will most likely have it too


[9/12/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
No no it’s okay.


[9/12/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
But yea if it’s genetic lol most likely

how was your day love?


[9/13/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
It was like a full math day. So I finished all my sociology and English reading or scanning in the morning, then went to office hours and worked on problems for math for an hour or so. Then went to my actual math lecture where I fell asleep and it was funny because I fell asleep in such a way that the notebook on the table fell on the floor with the pencils and everything 😂. And then got back, worked on quite a lot more math problems that I was weak on, and just finished.


[9/13/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Still gonna go the same tomorrow morning and then I think I got it!

[9/13/2023 8:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Like I am telling you if more than 2 good things were happening to me, I always thought that there was something bad waiting for me that was waiting to happen.


[9/13/2023 8:58 PM] sskarz
that's something i like to call, "being scared of ghosts". if there's nothing there to scare you, then there is nothing to be afraid of


[9/13/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz
no i totally get that, i used to think the exact same way


[9/13/2023 8:59 PM] sskarz

It was nice, i did a little bad on the math quiz but have been getting full points for the homework. Sociology and philosophy wasnt too bad, I basically got like an early quiz review, like what to expect and all for both, and history was easy as always, just note taking, Went to buy cereal and cheeseballs at walgreens and then roommates went home for the weekend so just chilling alone


[9/14/2023 9:22 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?

That’s the one thing I would probably mess up on doing at the gym, trust me I would lift the weight the wrong way or something


[9/17/2023 9:21 AM] prabipyakurel
It would be pretty funny 😄


[9/17/2023 9:22 AM] sskarz
Haha it’s okay tho, when we’re officially together I’ll take u and you’ll learn slowly and safely with me


[9/17/2023 9:22 AM] sskarz
It’s really simple if u have someone experienced with u


[9/17/2023 9:22 AM] prabipyakurel
Dw, I will go with you and keep bothering you every 5 min


[9/17/2023 9:23 AM] prabipyakurel
Then we can order pizza and stuff and go back home


[9/17/2023 9:23 AM] sskarz

[9/17/2023 9:26 AM] prabipyakurel
No I’m high school, there were like exercising machines on the second floor so when we finished warmup we would go up there. And there was this one where you would have to like set the thing for how heavy you want it on both sides and pull inward and I used to put it more than I could do and when I let go, I would launch myself somewhere.


[9/17/2023 9:27 AM] sskarz
Haha that’s pretty cool


[9/17/2023 9:27 AM] sskarz
U guys had real gym machines in high school?


[9/17/2023 9:28 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea there was an actual gym also for weight training and wrestlers but the one we went to it was like 6 or 7 machines that everyone played until the weight lifting class came and then I would just leave


[9/17/2023 9:28 AM] sskarz
Ohhh I see


[9/17/2023 9:28 AM] sskarz
That’s nice tho


[9/17/2023 9:29 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea if I see something similar to those, I will know how to use some because I I have watched people use them


[9/17/2023 9:30 AM] sskarz
Yeah trust me, a lot of machines in the gym work very similarly together, just gotta know what the tiny differences are


[9/17/2023 9:30 AM] sskarz
And I’ll help u with that dw

[9/17/2023 9:30 AM] prabipyakurel

[9/17/2023 9:32 AM] sskarz

[9/17/2023 9:32 AM] sskarz
But hey, what’s ur plans for today


[9/17/2023 9:34 AM] prabipyakurel
Um well I am probably gonna go down and get sushi for lunch from the store below, that or like ramen. And then I am going to continue studying, idk I am kind of freaking out about everything, and for dinner I am probably going to go to the Nepali store with my friend and eat momo. Kind of the same as yesterday.


[9/17/2023 9:34 AM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[9/17/2023 9:34 AM] sskarz
Hey hey why are you freaking out? Are you really okay?


[9/17/2023 9:34 AM] sskarz
Talk to me


[9/17/2023 9:35 AM] prabipyakurel
Um I am really scared about the math thing Thursday


[9/17/2023 9:35 AM] prabipyakurel
The other ones I got it, I will be fine


[9/17/2023 9:35 AM] prabipyakurel
But like, yk what if I do really bad on it


[9/17/2023 9:37 AM] sskarz
Don’t think like that, you’re going to step in that lecture hall and you’re going to do your best okay! I have complete faith that you will be fine, I know the last one might have really scared you because you didn’t do so well, but you’ve been practicing a lot and you even solved that really difficult math problem too

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/17/2023 9:38 AM] sskarz
It’s scary I know, but you will do well, I just know it! Believe in yourself for me, okay?


[9/17/2023 9:39 AM] sskarz
You’ve worked really hard towards this next math midterm and I know you’re going to nail that thing


[9/17/2023 9:40 AM] prabipyakurel
Mhm okie, I got this! I will try my best love, I promise. Thank you, I love you so much!

{Reactions}

[9/17/2023 9:41 AM] sskarz
And hey, if you ever feel those doubts coming back, please come tell me! That’s the one thing I can help you from here and I want you to be at your best!

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/17/2023 9:41 AM] prabipyakurel
It’s just I feel like I will make a dumb mistake somewhere


[9/17/2023 9:41 AM] prabipyakurel
And then once I mess up on one, I will mess up on the rest


[9/17/2023 9:42 AM] sskarz
I know, it’s a math test and it’s easy to make a mistake with the wrong negative sign and yk simple things like that, but as long as you slow it down, take your time on each step of the problem, you will notice if you made any mistakes

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/17/2023 9:42 AM] sskarz
What I like to do at the end of math problems is try to prove my own answer wrong, step by step, and if I can’t find a way to prove it wrong, then I know I’m right


[9/17/2023 9:42 AM] sskarz
Idk if you’ve ever done that, but that’s what really helped me to avoid those small mistakes


[9/17/2023 9:43 AM] prabipyakurel
Ahh, no I will try that for sure


[9/17/2023 9:44 AM] prabipyakurel
Thank you love, it means a lot.

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/17/2023 9:44 AM] sskarz
Hey, the key factor to making no mistakes is believing in yourself and your math solving abilities. The more practice you do, the more confident you become, and once you’re comfortable with a specific type of problem, you can move onto the next

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/17/2023 9:44 AM] sskarz
It’s just this one thing that I can make a real impact even being so far from you, I wanna make sure you use me to lift yourself up okay?


[9/17/2023 9:45 AM] sskarz
I love you and I’m always believing in you!


[9/17/2023 9:47 AM] prabipyakurel
Thank you, I will go in and do my best on that thing. And I will continue practicing more and more until I have gotten all of them down.

[9/17/2023 8:26 PM] sskarz
here's a reason to stick to me if you didn't love me enough already:


[9/17/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
the world is now moving towards tech doing stuff for us and AI and what not, and that means newer tech innovations


[9/17/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
which means that the future generations of tech, you'll never have to be confused as I'll take care of the research and general knowledge about all tech involved :)


[9/17/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz
so you'll never have to worry about any of the weird tech stuff that comes out in the future, and that's a great positive point!


[9/17/2023 8:27 PM] sskarz

[9/18/2023 2:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Have you done this before?


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
reminds me of piecewise functions


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea that thing


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
what is the section called?


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
oh it is?


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Absolute values and piecewise


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
from what it looks like


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] sskarz
you're given an x value, that can only be substituted into one of the functions depending on its range


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Wait no shit, you in class, explain later


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Get back to work love


[9/18/2023 2:30 PM] prabipyakurel
Sorry


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] sskarz
im not!


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] sskarz
i have class in 30 dw


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] sskarz
i can help!


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh ok ok


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] prabipyakurel
So would I plug in all those x values to see which one is a solution


[9/18/2023 2:31 PM] sskarz
yes you would get a solution based on what you get for x


[9/18/2023 2:32 PM] sskarz
so u would substitute x into whatever function that has the appropriate range for that x value


[9/18/2023 2:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh gotcha


[9/18/2023 2:32 PM] sskarz
for example, if you have x >= 2 as your range, and you have a value x = 1, you can't substitute that since its not in its range


[9/18/2023 2:32 PM] sskarz
but if it was x = 2, then u could and there is a solution there


[9/18/2023 2:33 PM] sskarz
this is all coming from memory, so you should definitely double check if you can


[9/18/2023 2:33 PM] prabipyakurel
No no it makes sense


[9/18/2023 2:33 PM] prabipyakurel
I did it for one and I will do it for the rest


[9/18/2023 2:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Thank you


[9/18/2023 2:33 PM] sskarz
okay, double check tho!


[9/18/2023 2:34 PM] sskarz
i don't wanna accidentally gaslight you 😂


[9/18/2023 2:34 PM] sskarz
also, weird that you're doing that in calculus, that's like some algebra stuff


[9/18/2023 2:34 PM] sskarz
never did that ever in my calc classes


[9/18/2023 2:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Lol I trust you but I will show the professor to check for sure.

[9/18/2023 2:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea idk what this dude is doing


[9/18/2023 2:35 PM] sskarz
yeah


[9/18/2023 2:35 PM] sskarz
and that last thing u got stuck on with that huge ass thingy


[9/18/2023 2:35 PM] sskarz
idk what that was about


[9/18/2023 2:36 PM] sskarz
never seen that before


[9/18/2023 2:36 PM] sskarz
u sure u in calc 1? 😂


[9/18/2023 2:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Idk at this point


[9/18/2023 2:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Math is math


[9/18/2023 2:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Sigma notation


[9/18/2023 2:37 PM] sskarz
right


[9/18/2023 2:37 PM] sskarz
sigma notation stuff... that was later in the calc 1 year


[9/18/2023 2:37 PM] sskarz
feels like your professor is all over the place lol


[9/18/2023 2:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Literally all over the place


[9/18/2023 2:38 PM] prabipyakurel
He does something one day and then the next day he teaches something 4 chapters ahead that doesn’t connect in anyway


[9/18/2023 2:38 PM] prabipyakurel
For a lot of my hw problems I have to use khan academy and google to teach myself


[9/18/2023 2:38 PM] sskarz
yeah no doesn't seem like anything is connecting together


[9/18/2023 2:39 PM] sskarz
maybe it'll pick up later in the semester


[9/18/2023 2:40 PM] prabipyakurel
I really hope so, but hey thank you so much for helping me, I love you. I got to start packing up to go across campus for the actual math lecture as well. You have a good class and I will talk to you tonight!

how was your study session?


[9/18/2023 8:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea thats alright love, I realized you would be driving so i wanted to wait.


[9/18/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
It went well, i was in there for an hour and a half and I have not prepared enough, I am literally still working on reviewingthe key terms and such. Other than that, I went to the office hours for the full 2 hours and learned some new things. Then attended the math lecture where he brought up a new topic, still processing that. I finished my timeline but realized that my resources also need explanation so need to work on that. Also found out that we still got math homework due by the end of the week, so gonna start on that in a little bit. Um then I got my philosophy reading out of the way for tomorrow. But yea not I am just doing whatever I can to prepare for all 2 exams I have.


[9/18/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
sorry that was a lot


[9/18/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/18/2023 8:32 PM] sskarz
Wow you sound like you have a lot on your plate, you okay?


[9/18/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
Um I am fine, just trying to get through all of it, just when I thought math was getting better, I literally ran across so many other things i needed to do


[9/18/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
Eh it was okay, got hit by some heavy stuff in lectures with tons of math so I’m still processing it all, and I guess that’s about it really. Nothing too interesting


[9/18/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh I see, but hey you got it, its okay.


[9/18/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
Just focus on one thing at a time, trying to cover all at the same time will do you no good, so focus on honing your skills on a specific type of problem, get confident, then move on


[9/18/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm yea thats what I am going to do.

[9/18/2023 8:47 PM] sskarz
You’re so busy I don’t doubt that at all, but keep yourself in check okay? If you just need to step away from it all, don’t be afraid to take a break every once in a while, it’s healthy for your brain


[9/18/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz
Yeah I gotcha


[9/18/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz

Was it truly a good thing that Julius Caesar died from the Roman Empire era?


[9/18/2023 9:59 PM] sskarz
like if we really think about it


[9/18/2023 9:59 PM] sskarz
He ended the civil war and voted for dictator for life, conquered countries like Spain before it was formed

[9/18/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz
It’s like a moral dilemma


[9/18/2023 10:00 PM] sskarz

But when he died, he lost all influence on the Roman Empire


[9/18/2023 10:01 PM] sskarz
So, really was it a good thing? With how it all ended up?

[9/19/2023 7:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Um I started with sociology which was pretty simple (other than the fact that my water bottle was loose and I had it in my backpack so I spilled some in there). Then I went to philosophy and got some more clarification on terms and understood them better. I went to sociology office hours straight hours to tell him to check my timeline project and realized I was still missing some formating things. I had lunch and started on math (we still have homework and midterms this week), and I attended a zoom math session for some topics so that was helpful. I went to my last history class for the day which was normal and simple. I had dinner and finalized the timeline project and turned it in.


[9/19/2023 7:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Also, my math midterm is on friday, so i got more time to prepare.

[9/19/2023 7:51 PM] sskarz
ohhhh there's a lot of space on the floor to do that?


[9/19/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
yea, so there are so many books and shelves that a lot of the shelves are so close together and you have to move this big handle just to open up that section that you want


[9/19/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
and it creates this gap


[9/19/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/20/2023 2:27 PM] sskarz
yeah?


[9/20/2023 2:27 PM] prabipyakurel
How would I start this?


[9/20/2023 2:28 PM] sskarz
probably by bringing that exponent down, so i believe you can do natural log to both sides to get rid of e on both sides and the equation would look like: x ln(4x) = 3x ln(x)


[9/20/2023 2:29 PM] sskarz
since natural log is base e, you can use that to cancel out the e


[9/20/2023 2:29 PM] sskarz
once u do that, u can solve it normally


[9/20/2023 2:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Let me try


[9/20/2023 2:29 PM] prabipyakurel
Thanks


[9/20/2023 2:29 PM] sskarz

[9/20/2023 7:15 PM] sskarz
well, actually nothing too crazy, but i had like an "in class assignment" (aka quiz) but it was open notes and we could talk together


[9/20/2023 7:16 PM] sskarz
and it was for my algorthms class, which is just all math stuff and its pretty difficult stuff


[9/20/2023 7:16 PM] sskarz
so my friends and i all huddled in the front corner of the room, got our tables and formed a circle together


[9/20/2023 7:16 PM] sskarz
and we all worked on the same problems together


[9/20/2023 7:16 PM] sskarz
so much so, that we were 1 of 2 groups that actually finished the thing


[9/20/2023 7:16 PM] prabipyakurel
awwwwww lilke little penguin huddle cute


[9/20/2023 7:17 PM] sskarz

[9/20/2023 7:17 PM] sskarz
we have like 50 people in our class


[9/20/2023 7:17 PM] sskarz
and only about i'd say 15 people turned it in, including my group


[9/20/2023 7:17 PM] prabipyakurel

😭


[9/20/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
We we just started talking and I was telling her about school and all and she was just talking about the teej parties and stuff and how the turf looks amazing


[9/20/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
and then at the end..


[9/20/2023 8:29 PM] prabipyakurel
omg she randomly asked, do you and sanskar talk


[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
like chat


[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] sskarz
ooooooooooooooooo


[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] sskarz
and what did you say?


[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I froze for a good 5 seconds

{Reactions}
😂 

[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I told her like we talked a little through insta over the summer


[9/20/2023 8:30 PM] prabipyakurel
and she paused and just went mhm ok


[9/20/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
oh my god 😂


[9/20/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
hey love before you say anything, i swear to you i haven't said anything to her or anyone


[9/20/2023 8:31 PM] sskarz
i just said namaste in the teej and left it at that

{Reactions}
😂 

[9/20/2023 8:31 PM] prabipyakurel
and she went like oh he posts pictures or something, and i went like small stories sometimes


[9/20/2023 8:31 PM] prabipyakurel
and she just went i see and went mhm, and then proceeded to saying, "anyways good night and study well"


[9/20/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
It was so random, my hands were like shaking


[9/20/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
I trust you lol


[9/20/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
I am pretty sure she did not start thinking we were dating just because you said namaste and smiled


[9/20/2023 8:32 PM] prabipyakurel
but i am sure she knows nothing


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
hahaha that got my heart racing i'm ngl 😂


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
that is really random


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
no it was


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
and the fact the she didnt have a follow up question got me thinking


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] prabipyakurel
I was about to explode here


[9/20/2023 8:33 PM] sskarz
what do you think?


[9/20/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
No that usually means she is thinking of something


[9/20/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
and she probably likes you


[9/20/2023 8:34 PM] prabipyakurel
now if my dad and brother start asking, idk that would make me think


[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
but mom is fine, she probably just saw how cute and nice you were at kreepa's party and the teej party.


[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
gotta be the best to show the best 😤


[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
you are the best love

[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
that is quite interesting tho


[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] sskarz
huh


[9/20/2023 8:35 PM] prabipyakurel
you dont even have to worry


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] sskarz
no ur the best trust me


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] prabipyakurel
no because we went from talking about turf to that


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] prabipyakurel
like it was an instant random question "do you talk to sanskar"


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] sskarz
seems like she's been meaning to ask you, just didn't know how so she got impatient? or just general curiosity


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] sskarz
either way, if they're thinking about you talking to me, good sign!


[9/20/2023 8:36 PM] prabipyakurel
Perhaps, maybe lol


[9/20/2023 8:37 PM] sskarz
now let's continue our fake convos a little more through organic memes or something like that, and make a reputable conversation and degree of friendship


[9/20/2023 8:37 PM] prabipyakurel
NO fr, usually if i tell her i am talking to a friend over chat and it was a dude she used to be like "who is it" "why", and when i told her i talked to you for a little she just went mhm ok


[9/20/2023 8:37 PM] prabipyakurel
and then told me good night


[9/20/2023 8:37 PM] prabipyakurel
i was like expecting a "dont fall in love lecture"


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
you've gotten that before when talking to guys? 😂


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
hahaha that's hilarious


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
this is why insta needs to stay neutral


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
i cant show discord


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
cant show number because you asked on discord, connections


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
so insta it is


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
yeah but we should build more of a conversation repertoire yk?


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] prabipyakurel
and because brother knows we talked on insta before


[9/20/2023 8:38 PM] sskarz
so its believable


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
we got months love dw


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
like here's my thinking


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
we will dedicate a week before to make it like we have not been talking to each other everyday


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
if i show a little more interest in our insta chats over time, like maybe once a week or once every two weeks, it can get them thinking if they ask again


[9/20/2023 8:39 PM] sskarz
can't talk too much otherwise its obvious


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
can't talk too little or the idea is fading


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
gotta keep it just right


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] prabipyakurel
no yea


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] prabipyakurel
its okay, sometimes out of the blue ask how life is at random and i will do the same


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
most organic way is if u post a story, or if i do, we can reply to it and have a short convo and go from there


[9/20/2023 8:40 PM] sskarz
that way it doesn't seem so random yk?


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
no yea thats what imma do now


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
same


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
keeps interest


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
again not too often


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
but just enough so that its a silent factor


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
and that way if they ever go, so what do you talk about i can be like


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
random stuff


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
nothing too deep yk


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
yeah


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
and if they ever ask to see our chat


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
u can show them


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] prabipyakurel
I can


[9/20/2023 8:41 PM] sskarz
and it'll be an indicator


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
mhm


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
not that we're dating, but we are talking like friends


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
and it'll get them into the idea of us being together


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
that can snowball into bigger things for us later down the road


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Dont worry, my mom likes you as a person, i can already tell

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] prabipyakurel
oh yea keep it formal so they can be like, "you talk about anything else"


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
great news, now i just gotta become the best so they consider me to the highest degree over all other guys 😂


[9/20/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz
i'll put my formal texting on dw

{Reactions}
😂 

[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
i text in a very different way with people i don't know or don't talk to very often


[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Trust me, they probably already think you are the best


[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
i heard them talking about you and me once


[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] sskarz
gotta be better than best 😤


[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
it was when we came back from the one time you showed me the vinyls


[9/20/2023 8:43 PM] prabipyakurel
they were like "so sanskar huh" and i walked in and they smiled and stopped


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
You already are love, dont even worry


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
and they still thinking about it, its a great sign


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
just gotta keep it going


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
subtle


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
but effective


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
It really is


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
but hey we did good fooling people in person


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] prabipyakurel
we can do it online


[9/20/2023 8:44 PM] sskarz
my parents don't even hide it from me, unlike your parents they just like "SO PRABI WAS REAL CUTE WASN'T SHE, WANNA DATE HER?"


[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
and im like GAD DAYUM I JUST WOKE UP WTF 😂

{Reactions}

[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
"we shall see"


[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
they know i like the idea of being with you, but i shut it down because you're in berkeley as an excuse


[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
ofc that wouldn't stop me


[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
but yk


[9/20/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
deadass


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
the one time we went to dinner for fathers day


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
oh wait no, after the party


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel
Awwwwwwwwww, yea use the distance as excuse


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
the morning after that party where we met


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
literally


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
mom and sister both


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
first thing


[9/20/2023 8:46 PM] sskarz
"so u think prabi was cute? would u be interested in her? and i don't mean as a girlfriend, like life partner? u see her as one?"

[9/20/2023 9:10 PM] sskarz

[9/20/2023 9:11 PM] sskarz
my heart was about to explode, i was like holy shit


[9/20/2023 9:12 PM] sskarz
not like he's close to my family or anything at all, but that was the closest anyone's ever been


[9/20/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh damn


[9/20/2023 9:12 PM] prabipyakurel
lol you know sometimes when you have class till 8 i wait so long to message you and i just start with hey how was your day


[9/20/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
because i keep on thinking that sometimes you will be eating dinner with your family with the phone on the table, and when you go help or put dishes in the sink someone gonna be like, so hmm you do talk to her


[9/20/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
thats why i try not to start with hey love 😂


[9/20/2023 9:13 PM] prabipyakurel
since you have notifications on


[9/20/2023 9:13 PM] sskarz
don't worry, won't happen. every time i leave my phone out in the open, its always locked and it requires faceID


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
but i rarely ever leave my phone out of my sight


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
its very rare that i leave it out of my pocket somewhere my family can access it


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhh gotcha


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
also my notifs hide your messages


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
as in, it'll show discord, but nothing else


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
no name, no message


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] sskarz
till its unlocked


[9/20/2023 9:14 PM] prabipyakurel
ohhhh okie okie


[9/20/2023 9:15 PM] prabipyakurel
and i also dont want you to be showing someone a video or something and my name pops up saying hey love


[9/20/2023 9:15 PM] prabipyakurel
idk i have imagined that happening


[9/20/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
that is probably more likely to happening, but if im outside somewhere, and there's a chance for u to msg me, i preemptively turn on DND


[9/20/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
on my phone, not discord


[9/20/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
so no notifs come up


[9/20/2023 9:16 PM] sskarz
trust me, i'm very secure most of the time


[9/20/2023 9:17 PM] sskarz
when it comes to these kinds of life breaking secrets, i'm very aware of everything that could question the integrity of the secret

i think we will have more freedom, and at that point i think our families will be aware of some level at that point


[9/20/2023 11:09 PM] sskarz
whether we tell them or not


[9/20/2023 11:09 PM] prabipyakurel
we will see


[9/20/2023 11:10 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/20/2023 11:10 PM] sskarz

[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] prabipyakurel
Last year of law school


[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz
ah okay


[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] prabipyakurel
so like 6 years or so from now


[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz
hmmmmm ok ok


[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/20/2023 11:11 PM] sskarz

[9/20/2023 11:12 PM] sskarz

i love you so much


[9/20/2023 11:14 PM] sskarz
i love you a lot too


[9/20/2023 11:14 PM] prabipyakurel
and for sure, who knows maybe I will be able to tell them after graduation and all


[9/20/2023 11:15 PM] sskarz
The only reason I would want to tell them is because it would give peace of mind, and also give us a lot more freedom yk? Idk if I can do 6 straight years of having to sneak you around with me and doing that, in 6 years that’s going wrong somewhere somehow eventually and being found out


[9/20/2023 11:16 PM] sskarz
That’s what I’m concerned about


[9/20/2023 11:17 PM] prabipyakurel
No I completely understand, trust me I dont want to have to sneak around either, and I will definitely think about it. I just dont want them to be like, you are too young for this


[9/20/2023 11:17 PM] prabipyakurel
you know even if they like the idea


[9/20/2023 11:17 PM] sskarz
No yeah I understand, don’t worry I’ll be here for a very long time. There’s no one else I would want more

{Reactions}
❤️ 

[9/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
But sanskar, I will change in 3 years and maybe I will tell them so that we can be more comfortable you know


[9/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
Once I get into law school and graduate from here, we will see


[9/20/2023 11:18 PM] prabipyakurel
I will and have been considering it


[9/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
That’s why I wish I could see into the future, things like this


[9/20/2023 11:18 PM] sskarz
And I don’t mean to force you at all okay


[9/20/2023 11:19 PM] sskarz
If you don’t feel comfortable, I am not at all trying to pressure you


[9/20/2023 11:19 PM] prabipyakurel
You never pressure me sanskar, we are in this together love, never think that way.

[9/20/2023 11:21 PM] prabipyakurel
No I will, Its not a bad idea, and looking at the circumstances in the future when the time comes, who knows, i might just tell them.


[9/20/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
Things will probably change and you’re gonna be a grown up too, so I don’t think they’d reject if you did. But again, only if you are comfortable


[9/20/2023 11:22 PM] sskarz
Not that you’re not a grown up, but yk not having parents watch over your shoulder every day


[9/20/2023 11:22 PM] prabipyakurel
I will be, I am comfortable, you never force me to do anything okay love.


[9/20/2023 11:23 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/21/2023 8:07 PM] sskarz
How’re you feeling?


[9/21/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
So for sociology, he assigned a 5-7 page paper, which is a later problem. For Philosophy, it went well, we had 2 definitions of 100 or more words and then 2 essays from 300-500 words. I am telling you it was not enough time, but I wrote what i needed and it was good. Um then after that class ended i took 15 min to eat lunch and then ran across campus to the math office hours from 1-3, then forgot I had math discussions at 3:30, so I went there. After that was done, I went to history, which was a movie, but it was dark in there and I only got a little bit of math done in there. After that I had dinner and came back and did the sociology quiz.


[9/21/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel
Roommates are gone, and I am alone.


[9/21/2023 8:10 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/23/2023 7:21 AM] prabipyakurel
Didn’t feel too good eating that much in the morning


[9/23/2023 7:22 AM] prabipyakurel
So I was like, I will stock up a few breakfast snacks and coffee


[9/23/2023 7:22 AM] sskarz
From the dining halls?


[9/23/2023 7:22 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea


[9/23/2023 7:22 AM] sskarz
Oh that’s pretty smart


[9/23/2023 7:23 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea during orientation it was in paper plates, so I used to get breakfast and bring it up and eat it here


[9/23/2023 7:23 AM] sskarz
Ohhhh nice


[9/23/2023 7:24 AM] prabipyakurel
But like I felt sick with literally everything, the food, the weather and Covid speeding the first week so I just stopped the breakfast thing

[9/23/2023 8:16 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/24/2023 6:58 PM] prabipyakurel
well my day was boring pretty much, got a sense of the outline I want for my history and sociology paper, almost done summarizing all of my documents. I studied some LSAT question because I ran out of things to do. And I eventually got so bored that I went to go check out the frozen yogurt place and it was awesome. I am currently still continuing some more work and eating this packaged butter chicken rice thing that takstes like tomato sauce and rice.


[9/24/2023 6:58 PM] prabipyakurel
Pretty much it.


[9/24/2023 6:59 PM] sskarz

How was your day?


[9/24/2023 7:04 PM] sskarz
um, quite productive actually even on just 4 hours of sleep which is wild. started the day off in the study room and finished my lab which wasn't that bad. And then i played with my buddies for about 2 hours then i got back to working on my laptop and organizing my workflow for classes tomorrow. After that, I went to the gym and had a good workout despite me absolutely not wanting to go 😂, gotta do what you gotta do! Finally, I went by Marshalls to see if I could get another water bottle since I lost the other one last week, and there was no small thermoflask type bottle so I'm just gonna get one tomorrow at the book store. Came home, took a shower, and then I started organizing my entire room because I realized that EVERYTHING was out of order, so just been trying to organize stuff and not have a giant hidden mess 😅


[9/24/2023 7:04 PM] sskarz
that's about it tho


[9/24/2023 7:05 PM] sskarz
i got some baked hot cheetos that i got from sams club since they're lower in calories, and just been munching on that as a late night snack


[9/24/2023 7:05 PM] sskarz
i said nah, not doing fasting tonight right after i said to u i was gonna fast 😂


[9/24/2023 7:06 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/24/2023 7:07 PM] prabipyakurel
It happens lol, its okay, I do that too


[9/24/2023 7:07 PM] sskarz
i actually don't mind it, its like less spice on each chip and each chip feels a little more hollow, but its better than nothing lol


[9/24/2023 7:07 PM] sskarz

[9/24/2023 9:25 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/24/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
i thought i could just get rid of it, but last time i had to use one in one of my classes, and idk if he's gonna repeat that


[9/24/2023 9:25 PM] sskarz
yeah definitely


[9/24/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
would reduce the weight of my backpack, but oh well


[9/24/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
its not that heavy, but i like having it light lol


[9/24/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
yea i try doing that too, but days when i have math, I carry like 2 notebooks, laptop and mathbook and it gets pretty heavy


[9/24/2023 9:26 PM] sskarz
omg i was just cleaning out my backpack, and i found a lens wiper for glasses 😂


[9/24/2023 9:26 PM] prabipyakurel
but yea manage it so its easier


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] prabipyakurel
damn, you still have your glasses or you threw it out?


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
you know, sometimes I look at old pictures of myself and I think about how I used to wear glasses, I'm so used to not having any glasses anymore I forgot I used them all my life


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
my dad took them the day I had my surgery and threw them away, which I was kinda mad about


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
but it is what it is


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
I still have my other glasses, including my first ever pair


[9/24/2023 9:27 PM] sskarz
he's not getting rid of any of those


[9/24/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
it's a reminder of who I was and how I became who I am today yk?


[9/24/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
I like to keep things like that


[9/24/2023 9:28 PM] sskarz
always remind yourself of how you've progressed in your life and see how far you've come, helps whenever you're feeling down about something in the present


[9/24/2023 9:28 PM] prabipyakurel
Awwww no yea keep those


[9/24/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
I still have my first second and third pair lol


[9/24/2023 9:29 PM] prabipyakurel
its just everywhere


[9/24/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz
that's great love, keep them


[9/24/2023 9:29 PM] sskarz

[9/24/2023 9:30 PM] prabipyakurel
i used to wear my first pair when I needed to sleep and watch something so in case it breaks its not my actual one with better perscription


[9/24/2023 9:30 PM] prabipyakurel
I only started in 8th grade but it feels nice to keep it


[9/24/2023 9:30 PM] sskarz
hey just letting you know, if you wear the wrong prescription for an extended period of time, it can mess up your eyes even more


[9/24/2023 9:30 PM] prabipyakurel
yea thats why i dont anymore


[9/24/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
the first pair, its hard to see out of


[9/24/2023 9:31 PM] sskarz
that is wild, i used to wear glasses since i was conscious of life 😂


[9/24/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
damn no its okay


[9/24/2023 9:31 PM] prabipyakurel
i knew my eye sight was getting worse and worse


[9/24/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
if they didnt do that random eye exam in 7th grade and the report wasnt send to my parents I would have probably not gotten them till later


[9/24/2023 9:32 PM] prabipyakurel
It was getting a little blurry near the end of 7th grade but i never told them, yea even the doctor was surprised when she told me to read and I went, sorry, cant


[9/24/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel
imma need to see some little sanskar pics later in life


[9/24/2023 9:33 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/24/2023 9:35 PM] sskarz

[9/24/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz
I'm literally trying to organize my entire life rn 😂


[9/24/2023 9:53 PM] prabipyakurel
lmao


[9/24/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz
and since I'm fully into the apple ecosystem, I thought it'd be easier to just sync everything across devices and make my life easier

{Reactions}
👍 

[9/24/2023 9:53 PM] prabipyakurel
planner is fun, as long as you keep up with it


[9/24/2023 9:53 PM] sskarz

[9/24/2023 9:54 PM] sskarz
I think it looks so aesthetically pleasing


[9/24/2023 9:54 PM] sskarz
just super minimalist


[9/24/2023 9:55 PM] sskarz
I do keep up with one, but it was a little outdated so I'm switching my systems


[9/24/2023 9:55 PM] sskarz
to some more modern solutions


[9/24/2023 9:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh no that looks nice


[9/24/2023 9:56 PM] prabipyakurel
the black background and not too many words


[9/24/2023 9:56 PM] sskarz
I just realized I marked the wrong times for my events 💀

[9/24/2023 10:31 PM] sskarz
I've done nothing for my planner 😂


[9/24/2023 10:32 PM] sskarz
Instead, I cleaned out my email of all the junk and got rid of all the unneccessary email subscriptions


[9/24/2023 10:32 PM] sskarz
now I'll actually get to the task planner haha


[9/24/2023 10:33 PM] prabipyakurel
Omg damn


[9/24/2023 10:33 PM] prabipyakurel
You go dude


[9/24/2023 10:34 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/24/2023 10:34 PM] prabipyakurel
I don’t have more than like 2 unread emails


[9/24/2023 10:34 PM] sskarz
i do, but for the past like couple months, maybe year, i've gotten so much email that is just super unneccessary and i realized it made me check my email for anything important way less often


[9/24/2023 10:34 PM] sskarz
so i had to clean it out


[9/24/2023 10:34 PM] sskarz
its good now


[9/24/2023 10:35 PM] sskarz
look at you go girl


[9/24/2023 10:35 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea make sure to just mark all as read when unnecessary


[9/24/2023 10:35 PM] prabipyakurel
I just can’t handle seeing unread emails


[9/24/2023 10:35 PM] prabipyakurel
Some psychopaths be having like 200+ unread

Bruh


[9/24/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
i was like, i don't need an email for every single move made


[9/24/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Select and mark it read right away


[9/24/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
no i straight disabled notifications from the website


[9/24/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
and deleted all the emails


[9/24/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh yea that works too

[9/24/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
Do you usually use a digital planner?


[9/24/2023 10:42 PM] sskarz
yeah


[9/24/2023 10:42 PM] sskarz
i'm a compsci student and tech lover, so im pushing for all my workflow to be digitalized


[9/24/2023 10:42 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh nice nice


[9/24/2023 10:42 PM] prabipyakurel
I’m here writing everything down on a dry erase board


[9/24/2023 10:42 PM] sskarz
especially being in this apple ecosystem, i'm trying to transfer my old android workflow to an apple workflow so that's why it's taking me a while to do all this


[9/24/2023 10:43 PM] sskarz
whatever works for you love


[9/24/2023 10:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Ohhhh I see


[9/24/2023 10:43 PM] sskarz
i know people that rather just do everything with physical notebooks and white boards


[9/24/2023 10:43 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea I do the white board and the reminder app


[9/24/2023 10:43 PM] sskarz
personally, i much prefer having my stuff sync across multiple devices so i can bring my workflow with me anywhere

Gracias, the only thing that I won’t forget about


[9/24/2023 10:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Ngl I have downloaded digital planners and eventually I’m just like


[9/24/2023 10:44 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah it’s not for me


[9/24/2023 10:44 PM] sskarz
yeah its not for everyone


[9/24/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz
but it helps me because my phone is the first thing i use when i wake up, and my planner would let me know what part of the day im at and what i need to take care of


[9/24/2023 10:45 PM] sskarz
so that's how i get stuff done


[9/24/2023 10:45 PM] prabipyakurel

That's why lol


[9/24/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
cuz on monday wednesday, class starting at 11 means i need to wake up around 6 and go at that time


[9/24/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
and people that have work at 8 are usually there, which means its packed


[9/24/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
and i can't wake up that early consistently usually 😂


[9/24/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
so I don't even try, 5 days a week is more than enough

hey love, hope your classes all went well!


[9/26/2023 7:46 PM] sskarz
How was your day?


[9/26/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey hey love, my day has been okay. I got up and check my midterm grade and surprisingly I didn’t fail, got 83/00. I also got full score for my sociology quiz. Then I attended my 2 classes and found out that for my philosophy midterm, he will take the strongest one and grade it so I am praying. Then I ended the day by going to history and finishing half the move from last Thursday. I also went to go eat dinner, but I didn’t like anything and didn’t really feel like eating it so I had a few onion rings and pumpkin pie. Now I am sitting and not doing anything, and looking for what needs to be done.


[9/26/2023 7:52 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[9/26/2023 7:53 PM] sskarz
oh hey that's good, you will be okay with philosophy I know. Is that math midterm grade the raw score or the rounded up one?

[9/26/2023 7:53 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
um i would finalize my schedule but i still need to work on the time stuff


[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
I dont know what to do


[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] prabipyakurel
im bored, but i can do something rn


[9/26/2023 8:13 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 8:14 PM] sskarz
Are u that type where if u start something new u try and finish it in that session


[9/26/2023 8:14 PM] prabipyakurel

Mhmmm makes sense


[9/26/2023 8:14 PM] prabipyakurel
once i go, i will keep going


[9/26/2023 8:14 PM] sskarz
So rn if u started on one of the papers, you would probably stay up all night to get it done tonight


[9/26/2023 8:15 PM] prabipyakurel
i would stay up and go until i run out of information


[9/26/2023 8:15 PM] sskarz
I see, yeah honestly u have tomorrow morning


[9/26/2023 8:15 PM] sskarz
U can start then since u have time leeway that’s not cutting into your sleeping time


[9/26/2023 8:15 PM] prabipyakurel
for sociology i need books and can only use what i have gathered from the previous morning, and for history, I need to review the files and find out where each document is


[9/26/2023 8:16 PM] prabipyakurel
I mean, I can stay up, i dont have anything early tomorrow


[9/26/2023 8:16 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 8:42 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
How long does the paper have to be?


[9/26/2023 8:45 PM] sskarz
And also, do they not allow u to use online resources like the entire web, just books?


[9/26/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel
5-7 double spaced, preferred books and not random websites


[9/26/2023 8:46 PM] prabipyakurel
they have to be like i think he said no biases and focusing on a specific arguments


[9/26/2023 8:47 PM] sskarz
Ah so an objective overview of events basically


[9/26/2023 8:47 PM] prabipyakurel
yep


[9/26/2023 8:47 PM] sskarz
So like I’m assuming ur gonna use books to cite as sources


[9/26/2023 8:47 PM] prabipyakurel
basically have to mention the event, what happened, and how it contributes to development using lecture and books


[9/26/2023 8:48 PM] prabipyakurel
yep gonna sit on the library floor between the shelves again


[9/26/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz
But how do u know what book to look for?


[9/26/2023 8:48 PM] sskarz
Like is there a section on George Washington biographies?


[9/26/2023 8:48 PM] prabipyakurel
I search it up on the university library website, it tells me which floor and what section number its located in and i go find it


[9/26/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
I am pretty sure


[9/26/2023 8:49 PM] sskarz
Like a title of a book?


[9/26/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
yea or just like the general idea of it


[9/26/2023 8:49 PM] prabipyakurel
so i type on indonesia or indonesian history and it shows me options


[9/26/2023 8:50 PM] prabipyakurel
and i pick some record the number and which library it is in


[9/26/2023 8:50 PM] prabipyakurel

He is friends with the one that stares at me


[9/26/2023 10:38 PM] prabipyakurel
So his math lecture is after mines right but since the first time I met him at office hours he came to the lecture that I attend with my friend and I. And him and that one that stares, they sit in the bottom row and me and my friend sit right above them. And Monday, we went sat down, and then he turned to the back, smiled until I smiled back and said “hi… prabi. And I was like hi.


[9/26/2023 10:39 PM] prabipyakurel
I also ran into him after dinner and didn’t recognize him without glasses, and then he said “oh hey” and then I was like oh it’s you again.

[9/26/2023 10:53 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 10:54 PM] prabipyakurel

[9/26/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz

{Reactions}

[9/26/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz

[9/26/2023 10:57 PM] sskarz
Oh no yeah that’s not on u, they are just reckless drivers


[9/26/2023 10:57 PM] prabipyakurel
They come so close sometimes I am like, I’m sorry, do you not see a crosswalk here


[9/26/2023 10:58 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s because it’s a crosswalk with no blinking lights or nothing so they have to see you to stop


[9/26/2023 10:58 PM] sskarz
Omg is it so much harder to see a real human than blinking lights, these drivers are some idiots


[9/26/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
They fr are


[9/26/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
But hey love, just stay safe ok?

[9/26/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
It’s just when I am on campus or on sidewalks I don’t look ahead of me


[9/26/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz

how was your day?


[9/27/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey hey, my day was good, I started off this morning got a little bit of everything done. Then after lunch I went to math office hours and cleared up my confusion about certain topics. But like today idk after like 30 mins in there I felt really drowsy and needed to put my head down for a little, and i usually stay the full office hours and go straight to math from there, but I couldnt today and came down to the library for a short 15 min nap before my math lecture. Then after I got back, i still felt like so sleepy and all, it has never happened before and i slept from like 5-6 and went for dinner, which was decent. And I have been working on the preparation for my history essay and am taking notes on the document that I need to write about.


[9/27/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
How about you?


[9/27/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
No need to ever apologize love.


[9/27/2023 9:01 PM] sskarz
oh okay, you still feeling sleepy?


[9/27/2023 9:05 PM] sskarz
my day has been going pretty well, english was boring as usual, lunch was great but made me sleepy too, lots of math today and then a boring class to end off on. Found out there was like this studyathon at a room so my friends and I went there and chilled out, they had free food and coffee which i so desperately needed. Didn't do much studying tho, just talked about classes and stuff with my friends i haven't seen in a while. It was pretty good, then afterwards i walked to where i usually parked, except i didn't park there for that time, so i walked across campus like twice because im dumb. Came home then got some work from my dad to do, then now I'm here.


[9/27/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel
Oh nice nice, glad to hear you caught up with friends, are you busy rn?


[9/27/2023 9:08 PM] prabipyakurel

wbu love?


[9/29/2023 10:12 AM] prabipyakurel
dw I slept well, i had no dream, woke straight in the morning


[9/29/2023 10:12 AM] prabipyakurel
what was it?


[9/29/2023 10:19 AM] sskarz
This dream was like super vivid idk why. So it was like I was part of this horror maze with some friends, and I was in the lead of everyone. And so everyone was having trouble navigating but I just went ahead and I lost them by going too far, and I found this door that had a label called "Secret" with like that classic blood horror type lettering. I went inside and it was just like a room that looked like a regular old apartment, with like a kitchen and dinner table and everything. It looked super normal, till I kept going in the room where I noticed things started repeating itself like the dining room would repeat itself as I kept moving into the room, and the kitchen would start duplicating itself as I kept moving. So much so that there were 5 identical fridges, and I checked in each of them and they were all the same. I know, but it gets weirder. As I checked the last fridge, I heard a random ass noise. Now I hadn't heard anything till then, and so I looked at the fridge with a closer eye and noticed there was like a small dog in a cage at the bottom of the freezer in the fridge. So I picked up the dog in the cage and I was like wtf, so I went to go back to where I came from, and for some reason there's just a bunch of the same dogs, but not in cages, all in a pile. And they all just stared at me, and the one I had started growling at me, so I threw it at the other dogs and ran for my life to the door where I came from. And then a dog got on my leg and started biting me and wouldn't let go, but I punted it and then I shut the door behind me. I just kept running and then I woke up


[9/29/2023 10:20 AM] sskarz
You know, people say there are meanings behind every dream, idk about that one 😂


[9/29/2023 10:21 AM] prabipyakurel
that is certainly weird, and dog biting is kinda scary


[9/29/2023 10:21 AM] prabipyakurel
but you will be fine


[9/29/2023 10:21 AM] sskarz
no yeah, i know what the dog looks like


[9/29/2023 10:21 AM] sskarz
i just don't know the breed name


[9/29/2023 10:22 AM] sskarz
but its like a small white dog


[9/29/2023 10:22 AM] prabipyakurel
ohhh

[9/29/2023 10:37 AM] sskarz

[9/29/2023 10:38 AM] sskarz
we don't learn ML over here, we learn something called Haskell

[9/29/2023 4:52 PM] sskarz
i mean yeah its just i hate seeing the number go down 😂


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] sskarz
literally like i was trying to put up a workload that i'm doing for a project, and it almost ran out of RAM


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] sskarz
at 16 gigs


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] sskarz
its just not enough anymore


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] sskarz
so I went with a higher end model with 32 gigs of RAM


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] sskarz
now that i'm saying this, i forgot to ask, do u know what RAM is?


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] prabipyakurel
i have an idea


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] prabipyakurel
its like just how much the computer can hold and stuff right


[9/29/2023 4:53 PM] prabipyakurel
i might be wrong


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] prabipyakurel
like how much storage perhaps


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
you're kinda right


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
ish


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
so


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
think of it like this


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
your RAM is your short term memory


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
stuff like getting groceries and then forgetting about it 10 years down the road


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
yk what I mean?


[9/29/2023 4:54 PM] sskarz
like its easy to remember, and easy to forget


[9/29/2023 4:55 PM] sskarz
your storage like how much stuff you can store in your computer, your long term memory


[9/29/2023 4:55 PM] prabipyakurel
ohhhh yea that makes sense


[9/29/2023 4:56 PM] sskarz
so my computer was like, there are too many groceries to pick up from too many places


[9/29/2023 4:56 PM] sskarz
so im giving it extra neurons


[9/29/2023 4:56 PM] sskarz
man this analogy sucks 😂

[9/29/2023 6:12 PM] sskarz
He sees the food, grabs a ball, goes to the food bowl, drops the ball on the side of the food bowl, takes one bite then goes to get the ball

My day has been normal, I got some more of both essays done in the morning, went to math office hours and reviewed some math concepts, and attended my math lecture where he moved way to fast. Then got back and ate some chow mein that I had saved from yesterday. I got started and finished half my math hw, and then went to eat dinner. After dinner, I got another paragraph of the history essay done, and now I am thinking if I should just call it a day or get more done for the sociology one (i have like 2 weeks till its due).


[10/2/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel
currently just listening to music and thinking.


[10/2/2023 8:45 PM] prabipyakurel

It’s been quite the day, a long one really. I started off by waking up late at like 8 and then went to UPS to get a box to return my laptop. Then got my sister some Starbucks for the morning since she didn’t have work, and then went to class. Boring as usual, but then I got a text saying that my laptop came early and that I could go pick it up so I did. Got it, then got some really good lunch, then headed back to my next class. It was okay, content was heavy and the lecture was recorded so I’m gonna go back and watch that later this week. The next class after was boring, got a midterm in 2 weeks for that class so yippeee. Then my final class, got a big assignment due this coming Sunday, and another mention of a midterm coming soon. Then I talked with some of my friends and then headed home. And now I’m here, family went out to Cheesecake Factory and they said they’re bringing some food back so I’m waiting for that. That’s all!

[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] sskarz
Uh, more like I knew them, we’re friends for 8th grade, then completely dropped when we went to highschool. They went to SG so yeah


[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
You will do awesome, remember to take breaks in between as always and rest.


[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Their name?


[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] sskarz
Idk if u know her, but she goes by Audrey Yu


[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah name is too common


[10/2/2023 8:53 PM] prabipyakurel
dont know her


[10/2/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
Yeah makes sense


[10/2/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
She was friends with a group of people I didn’t really hangout with, so we didn’t keep in contact in high school


[10/2/2023 8:54 PM] sskarz
And then I just got a random follow, then a message on my story about my new laptop


[10/2/2023 8:54 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhh nice nice


[10/2/2023 8:55 PM] prabipyakurel
thats good tho, they probably wanted to catch up with you


[10/2/2023 8:55 PM] sskarz
I guess..? I’m gonna be straight honest with you, I don’t really like to continue friendships after years of not talking at all, especially if I had no desire to stay friends even after drifting apart yk?


[10/2/2023 8:56 PM] sskarz
it all seems so sudden, and i don't like it


[10/2/2023 8:56 PM] prabipyakurel
No I get that feeling, it happens. Yea if you dont feel confortable love, its okay.


[10/2/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz
Yeah, so I left her on read 😋


[10/2/2023 8:57 PM] prabipyakurel

[10/2/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz

[10/2/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz

[10/2/2023 8:57 PM] sskarz

[10/2/2023 8:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I know that after 8th grade some of my closest friends I had no connection with because i had no form of social media, and after getting discord, I got each of their requests little by little, but yea if its really random after 8 years, idk about that either

It’s happened before it’s normal


[10/2/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
Love I am fine okay


[10/2/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
hey, you need to go to walgreens tomorrow and get some pain killers


[10/2/2023 10:19 PM] prabipyakurel
I’m okay, I just need to take a break from screen sometimes


[10/2/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
its not healthy for that to happen on a normal basis


[10/2/2023 10:19 PM] sskarz
yes please


[10/2/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
take a break okay?


[10/2/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
from now on, don't just do everything for long periods of time, take breaks in between


[10/2/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz
especially from the screen


[10/2/2023 10:20 PM] prabipyakurel
Hey I am okay, love it just happens sometimes, your eyes don’t hurt sometimes


[10/2/2023 10:20 PM] sskarz

hahaha for sure


[10/2/2023 10:36 PM] sskarz
omg is it just my parents, or like once a year, my parents will get super excited and will just buy a single lotto ticket, and then inevitably either get nothing or scream that they got $5 back and then it repeats the next year 😂


[10/2/2023 10:36 PM] prabipyakurel
My god, I thought that was only my parents

{Reactions}
😂 

[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
They get  overly excited for like a week in the entire year


[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
And after that they just don’t  care


[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
hahaha omg nepali parents are all just the same 😂


[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
omg yeah 😂


[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] sskarz
its like nothing happened


[10/2/2023 10:37 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea and the most is like oh wow “ 2 dollars”


[10/2/2023 10:38 PM] prabipyakurel
And when they don’t win anything they always go, just so close, I was so close to those numbers 😂


[10/2/2023 10:38 PM] sskarz
OMG YEAH 💀

{Reactions}
😂 

[10/2/2023 10:39 PM] sskarz
my mom got so sad one day, she actually got somewhat close to the jackpot by a couple numbers and then she got like nothing 😂


[10/2/2023 10:39 PM] prabipyakurel
It happens and I am there just like


[10/2/2023 10:39 PM] prabipyakurel
Yes I think everyone gets close to the numbers but doesn’t get the exact number


[10/2/2023 10:40 PM] prabipyakurel
I be like “it’s why it’s a lottery”


[10/2/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
yup


[10/2/2023 10:40 PM] sskarz
i don't really like those things, so i like watching other people do it haha


[10/2/2023 10:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Awww no yea my mom does the same thing she makes a sad face and just moves on


[10/2/2023 10:40 PM] prabipyakurel
Yea never gave those things a thought


[10/2/2023 10:41 PM] prabipyakurel
I feel like if something good has to happen , don’t force it, it should naturally just happen.

[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] prabipyakurel

[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] prabipyakurel
They looks so cool, now I wanna a class with these


[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
oh i have these in like every classroom


[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] prabipyakurel
Bruh


[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] sskarz
they are pretty nice


[10/2/2023 10:54 PM] prabipyakurel
I don’t have any classroom classes


[10/2/2023 10:55 PM] prabipyakurel
😭


[10/2/2023 10:55 PM] sskarz
imagineeee, that's all i have 😂


[10/2/2023 10:55 PM] prabipyakurel
Ahhhhhh


[10/2/2023 10:55 PM] prabipyakurel
I always walk past classrooms and go, damn, I wanna sit and swivel around


[10/2/2023 10:56 PM] prabipyakurel
But no I get a lecture hall where I barely have enough space to stretch my arms properly without knowing someone in the face with my elbow


[10/2/2023 10:56 PM] sskarz
wow its that packed always?


[10/2/2023 10:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Well for math, the place I sit yes because I sit in the front, and for my other lectures yes the seats are pretty close


[10/2/2023 10:57 PM] prabipyakurel
Occasionally there are empty seats next to me but only on one side


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
oh damn


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
i guess that makes sense, you guys have so many students


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] sskarz
and for a single class it has to be a huge lecture hall just to fit everyone


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
No yea


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
350 students for math


[10/2/2023 10:59 PM] prabipyakurel
I was dying when he said that


[10/2/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
holy shit


[10/2/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
u gotta send me a pic of that lecture hall


[10/2/2023 11:00 PM] sskarz
that's insane


[10/2/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
I will one day


[10/2/2023 11:00 PM] prabipyakurel
So my lecture has 350 and the next math lecture, same subject different group, also has about 300


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
that's crazy


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] sskarz
and im out here with max class size of 50 💀


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Nah


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] prabipyakurel
I will take a pic of all my lecture halls


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Some are spaced out better then others tho


[10/2/2023 11:01 PM] prabipyakurel
Some have a better writing surface while some are worse


[10/2/2023 11:02 PM] sskarz
yeah that makes sense


[10/2/2023 11:02 PM] sskarz
do you prefer classrooms like high school or lecture halls?


[10/2/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
That’s my math discussion probably


[10/2/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
Personally high school style but this is fine too it works


[10/2/2023 11:02 PM] prabipyakurel
I don’t completely hate it


[10/2/2023 11:03 PM] sskarz
yeah you probably have to just get used to it


[10/2/2023 11:03 PM] prabipyakurel
Mhm


[10/2/2023 11:04 PM] prabipyakurel

Um I got really scared around like 4-5


[10/3/2023 7:08 AM] prabipyakurel
So basically I was walking to the dorm apparently past like 7, and these group of boys noticed me and they would not stop chasing me, there was no one else on the streets and when I got to my building they caught up to me and then I woke up


[10/3/2023 7:09 AM] sskarz
Oh my god that’s terrifying


[10/3/2023 7:09 AM] prabipyakurel
I got up really scared and like for a second wanted to just cry


[10/3/2023 7:09 AM] prabipyakurel
But I calmed myself down, listened to one of your voice messages and then just slept again

[10/3/2023 7:10 AM] sskarz
No no don’t cry okay, you’re okay it’s just a dream love, you are gonna be fine


[10/3/2023 7:10 AM] prabipyakurel
No I know, it just felt so real for a little


[10/3/2023 7:10 AM] sskarz
I know, that must’ve felt terrible, I’m sorry that you had to experience that


[10/3/2023 7:11 AM] sskarz

[10/3/2023 7:11 AM] prabipyakurel
No no don’t say sorry love it’s okay


[10/3/2023 7:11 AM] prabipyakurel
Yea and at that time I realized I have classes until 6:30 and by the time I get to my dorm it’s almost 7 so it scared me even more

went to the gym early in the morning for an hour, but i had to stop because my body just felt so weak for no reason, and then when i walked out of the gym, everything was extraordinarily bright like the sun had crashed on me, and then i drove home and i felt way too weak to do anything for some reason, so i had lunch and had a mid day nap for like 2 hours. Afterwards, I felt a lot better. Then I went to class and then worked on some homework and studying. Came home, fed bear, and I'm still working on some homework and stuff like that


[10/3/2023 6:52 PM] sskarz

[10/3/2023 10:01 PM] prabipyakurel
my day was kind of busy, so started off with sociology, then went to philosophy (it was so boring i was dying in there), after that I went to office hours which was at like 1:15, then came to eat lunch real fast, came back to the room and checked for assignments and revised the essay. After that I had a zoom math session from 3:30-5:00, but I left the meeting 10 mins early to get to my history lecture which was useful. I got more info for my essay. Pretty much after that I had dinner, and have been working on editing and finding essay information.


[10/3/2023 10:04 PM] sskarz
oh okie sounds like a not so hectic day

So my first dream was weird, well the other one was weirder but here we go. I was wearing a suit and it started off me being in an elevator and reaching a floor, and it was this fancy room with gold and diamonds and stuff, and a table where there was a guy sitting there. So i go over to this guy and apparently i also had body guards and some other guys with me, and when I approached the guy near the table, he sets this like tech device and tells me i have 10 minutes to fiddle with it, and then i have to tell him about the product. And it’s a familiar looking product, but also not at all. It looked like a Nintendo switch but it was like of the future? So the guy leaves and then i start inspecting the thing and i make note about what was good and bad about it for literally like 10 mins. It felt super long till he came back, and he said give me a percent score, i said 60% and everyone was shocked and the guy was like, why? So then I start speaking out of my ass like I know any of this weird holographic tech stuff and he nods and says, so for 20 million would you want the patent? I say yes for some reason, then we shook hands and then the dream ended


[10/4/2023 7:11 AM] prabipyakurel
Damn, look at you in a suit with bodyguards and all 😂


[10/4/2023 7:11 AM] prabipyakurel
That sounds cool tho


[10/4/2023 7:12 AM] sskarz

[10/4/2023 7:12 AM] prabipyakurel

[10/4/2023 7:12 AM] sskarz

Sleep graph checks out, i had 3 REM cycles, 2 of those i remember weird dreams for


[10/4/2023 7:13 AM] prabipyakurel
Oh wow


[10/4/2023 7:14 AM] sskarz
Yeah so this next dream was just like… what


[10/4/2023 7:18 AM] sskarz
So it starts in this car and I’m driving with some of my friends and we park at this like old abandoned house. We were gonna setup and spend the night here for some reason I’ve got no clue. We start getting setup and then some time passes. Then gunshots start happening and we all rush down and start shooting them back? I was confused but i grabbed the nearest gun and I start shooting them, but then my friend gets shot and then he literally almost dies. So then, as best as I could explain it, time reverses and the dream goes back to the beginning of when we were parking, but i remember what happened last time. So I decided to warn them this time that we were gonna be ambushed and that my friend would die, so then we prepare for it and the thing happens again like Deja vu. This time tho, no one gets hurt, and then we all celebrate. But somehow someway i got shot and it shocked me and then i woke up and i actually had a sharp pain in my stomach for a very brief moment


[10/4/2023 7:19 AM] sskarz
Anyways, that was it


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] prabipyakurel
Um, your stomach doesn’t hurt rn though right?


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] prabipyakurel
You okay?


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] sskarz
No no it was just when i woke up


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] sskarz
For like 3 seconds


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] sskarz
And then it faded completely


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] prabipyakurel
That’s so weird


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] prabipyakurel
Dream was a little odd


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] sskarz
Yeah idk it always ends with me being shot 😂


[10/4/2023 7:20 AM] sskarz
Both of those were insanely vivid in memory


[10/4/2023 7:21 AM] prabipyakurel

[10/4/2023 7:21 AM] sskarz

I got super motivated so I decided to basically redo everything and get everything in life in order, so I redid my entire resume and worked on fleshing out my LinkedIn (since I got hacked and someone deleted all of my history stuff), then worked on more homework, then had to pick up a dai (same one from the day I was gonna ask u to be mine at your house) and then came home, refined my essay, and worked on my new project
