# GPT 2 AI User Imitation
 
This AI Project was created to simulate a human's texting behavior with another user. 

# Additional Notes

For this project, I have included all files I used except the GPT-2 model and Byte Point Encryption tokenizer I used for preprocessing the data, as those files can be found in their own respective repositories.

I have also hidden the original test data used for this project as it contained text messages that shall remain private. Feel free to use your own text data.

For users, the text data was directly taken from Discord, and the tokenizer I built was used to preprocess all meta data from Discord messages.

This project was built in 2023, however I have now uploaded it to Github after refining some of its capabilities.
