Oh
hey
,
I
hope
you
are
doing
well
.
Happy
4th
of
July
to
you
too
.🎆
Yea
like
2
days
ago
we
had
our
first
4th
of
july
in
South
El
Monte
,
and
it
was
pretty
good
.
Did
you
watch
it
?
[sskarz]
oh
no
I
didn
’
t
get
to
see
it
I
passed
out
that
day
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
happens
,
and
you
are
in
college
,
I
can
'
t
blame
you
.
How
is
everything
else
going
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
going
pretty
well
!
Started
teaching
another
class
and
it
’
s
been
pretty
smooth
so
that
’
s
where
all
my
attention
has
gone
to
for
the
summer
.
How
about
you
?
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
,
you
are
a
brilliant
person
so
I
am
sure
you
are
the
best
teacher
out
there
.
I
am
doing
alright
,
it
has
been
a
mixture
of
stress
and
happiness
as
sometimes
I
feel
like
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
while
other
times
I
just
think
about
all
the
things
that
can
go
wrong
.
But
overall
,
yea
it
has
been
kind
of
weird
.
[sskarz]
Brilliant
is
more
you
haha
,
but
I
appreciate
the
compliment
.
I
’
m
guessing
you
’
re
stressed
from
the
move
to
Berkeley
?
[prabipyakurel]
Aw
,
thank
you
.
Oh
my
god
,
yes
this
is
the
first
time
I
will
be
away
from
home
,
like
7
hours
type
of
away
and
when
I
think
about
it
it
makes
me
really
sad
.
I
am
going
to
miss
like
everyone
.
We
have
just
been
buying
stuff
to
take
over
there
and
figuring
out
how
I
am
going
to
manage
over
there
alone
.
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
it
can
be
scary
to
be
out
so
far
away
for
a
while
.
To
be
honest
I
haven
’
t
experienced
that
myself
so
I
can
’
t
speak
so
much
.
But
hey
it
’
s
going
to
be
a
fun
experience
!
If
you
ever
need
help
with
preparing
mindset
and
actual
stuff
to
move
,
no
one
knows
better
than
my
sister
so
try
contacting
her
if
you
ever
feel
a
little
lost
.
Knowing
you
though
,
I
know
you
’
ll
be
more
than
fine
!
💯
You
got
any
plans
to
celebrate
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
person
IYea
hopefully
I
will
feel
at
ease
after
a
few
months
there
,
but
I
will
probably
be
back
every
once
in
a
while
.
Your
sister
is
the
most
beautiful
and
helpful
personI
have
ever
met
,
like
she
is
amazing
.
She
is
very
cute
too
.
I
don
'
t
have
any
plans
today
,
probably
going
to
watch
a
movie
later
and
then
go
to
bed
,
that
is
if
the
fireworks
stop
and
I
can
actually
get
some
sleep
.
😂
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
We
got
a
bbq
going
on

[sskarz]
The

😤
WHAAAAAA
I
’
m
jealous
might
I
suggest
a
horror
movie
,
not
only
will
u
be
scared
from
the
movie
,
but
also
the
random
fireworks
that
pop
at
any
second
,
double
the
intensity
😈
around
August
for
my
college
classes
,
and
the
class
I
’
m
teaching
already
started
[prabipyakurel]
Next
time
you
come
I
will
show
you
,
they
are
pretty
old
and
dusty
.
I
looooove
horror
movies
,
its
nice
to
hear
that
someone
else
enjoys
them
too
.
Yes
for
sure
,
what
is
the
name
?
Wow
thats
like
a
month
away
,
time
flies
by
fast
,
this
sumemr
was
so
short
,
it
like
flew
by
fast
.
[sskarz]
I
love
watching
horror
movies
,
but
only
if
I
’
m
with
someone
,
otherwise
it
’
s
a
nope
haha
.
I
really
liked
the
conjuring
series
,
like
the
conjuring
1
was
a
pretty
good
movie
Yeahhhh
tho
I
’
m
not
as
excited
to
go
back
,
I
saw
the
professors
I
got
for
this
semester
and
they
’
re
mostly
terrible
😞
Have
you
got
your
class
schedule
yet
?
LETS
GOOOOOOOOOO
*
ahem
*
I
mean
I
would
be
glad
to
indulge
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
i
love
scaring
the
person
I
am
watching
it
with
.
No
I
have
my
classes
chosen
but
the
time
hasnt
come
for
me
to
finalize
it
yet
.
mhm
yea
for
sure
.
I
think
i
have
like
20
or
25
of
them
[sskarz]
ohh
hell
noooooooooooo
to
the
no
no
nooooooooooooooooooo
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
not
watched
the
conjuring
because
my
brother
is
someone
who
doesnt
enjoy
horror
movies
,
so
...
😳
yea
i
scare
my
brother
whenever
we
watch
anything
scary
together
like
turning
off
the
lights
is
like
so
fun
[sskarz]
I
remember
watching
the
Nun
and
it
just
wasn
'
t
scary
at
all
,
till
my
sister
turned
off
the
light
and
it
shifted
the
entire
mood
of
the
movie
haha
oh
nice
!
oh
you
gotta
,
the
series
is
pretty
good
with
like
Anabelle
doll
and
...
i
guess
dead
people
?
there
are
2
ways
to
watch
the
series
of
movies
,
either
from
chronological
order
or
the
order
the
movies
came
out
both
ways
are
a
good
way
to
watch
so
its
like
a
choose
your
adventure
sorta
like
star
wars
,
tho
i
personally
never
got
into
it
so
don
'
t
ask
me
anything
about
that
😅
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
need
to
watch
a
lot
of
horror
ones
.
Are
you
hearing
these
fireworks
[sskarz]
yeah
they
'
re
super
super
loud
even
through
my
headphones
I
can
hear
them
super
clearly

gonna
be
so
difficult
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

sure
My
neighbors

fireworks
and

any
time
in
the
day

the
living
daylight
out
of
my
dog
[prabipyakurel]
Right

my
first
experience

[sskarz]
rightttt
they
are
usually
finished
by
mid
august
or
early
september
in
my
experience
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
Gonna
be
a
while
then
How
is
your
dog
?
[sskarz]
we
gave
him
some
calm
down
pills
(
i
don
'
t
know
the
specific
name
),
and
we
put
him
in
my
sisters
room
with
really
loud
music
so
we
can
drown
out
the
sound
of
the
fireworks
he
gets
so
scared
and
starts
shuddering
but
he
seems
fine
right
now
[prabipyakurel]
ohhh
yea
i
hope
he
is
okay
,
seems
like
a
strong
dog
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
he
'
s
a
little
furball
that
can
'
t
take
more
than
a
small
spark
haha
[prabipyakurel]
furball
?
he
is
scary
tho
[sskarz]
he
seems
scary
u
know
those
fireworks
where
u
like
throw
it
on
the
ground
and
it
makes
a
tiny
spark
[prabipyakurel]
ohh
yea
those
[sskarz]
yeah
just
one
of
those
and
he
is
instantly
terrified
🤣
he
'
s
a
softie
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
lol
but
yea
it
was
nice
talking
to
you
after
a
while
[sskarz]
yeah
!
we
should
talk
more
often
👍
hope
you
had
a
good
night
!
🎉
🎆
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

good
night
,
despite
all
the
fireworks
😂
[sskarz]
will
try
to
!
😅
you
as
well
!
good
night
!
👋
😴
[prabipyakurel]
Hello
again
,
sorry
if
you
were
busy
,
um
do
you
know
this
person
?
I
am
just
wondering
.
[sskarz]
nope
why
do
you
ask
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
on
mutual
friends
it
shows
that
person
too
,
so
i
was
just
curious
.
[sskarz]
uh
let
me
search
them
up
,
maybe
i
have
history
but
i
don
'
t
remember
this
person
apparently
i
did
invite
this
person
to
some
server
back
in
2020
,
but
to
be
honest
i
can
'
t
remember
who
this
is
they
are
also
mutual
friends
with
a
professor
I
know
in
Mark
Keppel
,
so
my
guess
is
maybe
I
shared
a
class
with
this
person
?
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
i
see
,
yea
he
is
a
keppel
student
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
would
make
sense
[prabipyakurel]
but
yea
thanks
I
was
just
looking
around
and
saw
that
in
common
so
I
asked
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
no
worries
How
'
d
you
sleep
last
night
btw
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
after
most
of
the
big
ones
were
done
,
the
person
down
my
street
started
again
,
so
it
was
another
hour
after
that
.
I
honestly
don
'
t
know
when
I
fell
asleep
yesterday
to
be
honest
.
you
?
[sskarz]
I
kept
waking
up
to
the
sound
of
**
BANG
**
in
the
distance
like
6
times
over
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yep
that
too
[sskarz]
I
'
m
just
gonna
pray
that
they
all
finished
their
fireworks
last
night
and
no
more
from
now
on
😭
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yes
,
I
need
sleep
and
i
didnt
quite
get
that
yesterday
the
sky
is
so
foggy
and
smells
toxic
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
be
careful
,
the
air
quality
is
really
really
bad
right
now
👍
I
got
a
warning
on
my
phone
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
its
crazy
.
Apparently
around
SoCal
there
were
a
lot
of
illegal
fireworks
happening
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
happens
every
time
people
usually
buy
the
fireworks
through
"
gray
market
"
means
and
its
cheaper
that
way
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
trying
to
sleep
yesterday
and
was
wondering
how
much
these
people
must
have
spent
on
fireworks
.
mhm
yea
[sskarz]
if
you
try
and
get
it
legally
its
crazy
crazy
expensive
like
50
dollars
for
a
sizeable
boom
[prabipyakurel]
wow
yea
it
was
pretty
fun
yesterday
until
we
were
tired
and
wanted
to
sleep
and
we
usually
have
our
windows
open
because
of
the
heat
,
and
yesterday
I
was
like
"
um
no
"
and
closed
those
too
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
your
room
was
probably
heating
like
an
oven
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
so
hot
around
the
house
plus
the
smoke
and
noise
outside
[sskarz]
the
ozone
layer
taking
a
major
hit
every
year
lol
[prabipyakurel]
we
are
going
to
die
soon
mark
my
words
[sskarz]
💀
(
literally
me
)
[prabipyakurel]
right
this
thought
goes
through
my
head
like
everymoment
everyday
lol
[sskarz]
we
thought
about
this
back
in
2012
😂
that
cannot
be
healthy
😅
wait
are
you
a
fan
of
roller
coasters
then
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yessssssssssssss
i
am
always
willing
to
go
on
rides
[sskarz]
hahaha
awesome
,
have
you
ever
gone
to
Six
Flags
?
[prabipyakurel]
rollercoasters
,
bungee
jumping
and
all
things
dangerous
sound
fun
[sskarz]
finally
,
someone
sees
this
perspective
like
I
do
haha
[prabipyakurel]
no
,
the
last
time
i
remembered
I
was
still
kind
of
short
and
no
one
else
in
my
family
likes
high
rides
,
so
...
yes
,
do
you
like
rollercoasters
?
[sskarz]
of
course
!
I
recently
got
a
season
pass
for
six
flags
so
I
'
m
thinking
of
going
sometime
soon
I
also
wanna
do
sky
diving
later
on
bucket
list
items
you
'
ll
be
fine
for
six
flags
,
its
the
best
place
for
awesome
rides
👍
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yessssssssss
that
seems
so
fun
,
i
mean
things
can
go
wrong
,
but
who
cares
😂
yea
i
got
a
lot
of
dangerous
things
on
my
bucket
list
wow
usually
when
i
mention
rollercoasters
and
sky
diving
to
people
,
they
are
like
"
omg
no
"
but
damn
glad
to
know
someone
who
enjoys
those
things
.
[sskarz]
we
gotta
go
to
six
flags
,
I
feel
like
you
would
love
the
Tatsu
ride
❤
️
its
like
you
'
re
facing
down
the
entire
time
and
going
in
loops
and
stuff
its
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
talking
with
my
parents
about
roller
coasters
and
on
the
news
was
this
one
story
about
roller
coaster
malfunction
and
I
got
lectured
on
how
unsafe
it
is
.
[sskarz]
OH
!
was
it
that
headline
where
like
a
big
screw
was
missing
on
a
ride
and
it
had
to
be
put
taken
down
temporarily
?
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
saw
that
somewhere
yeahhhh
[prabipyakurel]
but
like
that
happens
rarely
and
i
think
i
am
fine
taking
that
chance
,
its
worth
it
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
a
super
rare
case
its
like
saying
,
"
don
'
t
get
on
airplanes
cuz
its
a
lethal
crash
",
like
if
its
not
a
Nepal
domestic
airplane
,
you
'
re
completely
fine
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
yea
I
dont
know
why
but
every
airline
seems
pretty
safe
aside
from
nepal
.
Also
I
counted
the
hot
wheels
and
found
out
I
have
exactly
37
of
them
.
[sskarz]
you
just
reminded
me
,
I
used
to
have
those
like
hot
wheel
orange
tracks
that
you
can
customize
to
put
in
loops
and
stuff
literally
the
best
👍
[prabipyakurel]
we
were
going
to
toss
them
or
give
them
to
a
kid
when
moving
but
then
i
took
all
of
them
and
was
like
nah
i
will
admire
them
,
thanks
[sskarz]
the
memories
✨
[prabipyakurel]
i
just
take
out
the
box
when
we
have
little
kids
over
,
like
whether
its
a
boy
or
a
girl
[sskarz]
like
who
doesn
'
t
like
little
toy
cars
haha
*
also
a
lot
of
nostalgia
*
the
ones
I
really
enjoyed
were
like
the
transformer
cars
because
I

a
feeling
I

in
college
.

a
typical
normal
day
[sskarz]

re
going
to
be
more
than
fine
,
I
can
tell
you
that
much
*
well
not
that
i
know
anything
about
economics
,
but
just
general
uplifting
advice
*
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
yea
and
sometimes
I
just
don
'
t
think
about
anything
school
related
and
watch
random
shows
.
[sskarz]
you
got
any
shows
you
'
re
watching
right
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
watch
a
lot
of
pakistani
dramas
but
nothing
new
right
now
Do
you
watch
hindi
movies
?
[sskarz]
yeah
I
do
,
sometimes
my
mom
likes
to
watch
them
downstairs
so
I
'
ll
join
her
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
it
means
a
lot
!
Oh
nice
[sskarz]
currently
we
'
re
watching
the
newest
season
of
Big
Boss
and
the
drama
gets
crazy
haha
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
I
dont
watch
that
but
every
once
in
a
while
,
slips
pop
up
on
youtube
and
I
watch
it
.
[sskarz]
oh
my
mom
loves
pakistani
dramas
,
though
I
haven
'
t
watched
any
of
those
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
,
yea
they
are
not
as
dramatic
as
indian
serials
,
but
they
are
like
kind
of
slow
and
fun
to
binge
watch
when
doing
something
else
.
[sskarz]
ahhh
I
get
that
I
don
'
t
watch
dramas
much
usually
,
but
if
I
do
then
korean
dramas
are
like
my
go
to
I
don
'
t
know
what
it
is
about
theirs
but
its
just
entertaining
but
I
can
'
t
really
put
my
finger
on
it
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
interesting
,
I
don
'
t
watch
them
in
episodes
but
sometimes
I
will
search
of
k
-
drama
funny
scenes
and
watching
it
without
understanding
a
singe
word
.
🤣
yea
,
i
understand
[sskarz]
so
what
'
re
your
plans
for
today
*
other
than
studying
*
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yes
thank
you
[sskarz]
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
probably
go
watch
funny
Instagram
reels
and
watch
people
fall
on
their
faces
[sskarz]
a
timeless
classic
for
sure
wait
so
for
your
next
semester
,
are
you
taking
major
courses
or
just
general
ed
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
um
yea
as
of
right
now
I
have
a
math
class
and
reading
/
writing
class
for
breadth
requirements
and
also
have
poli
sci
and
geography
that
covers
something
,
i
don
'
t
know
what
,
but
something
out
there
.
[sskarz]
"
something
out
there
"
that
'
s
a
MOOD
🤣
[prabipyakurel]
And
because
I
took
dual
enrollment
I
covered
my
Arts
and
Literature
✅
Biological
Sciences
✅
Historical
studies
✅
Social
and
Behavioral
Sciences
✅
Entry
-
level
writing
✅
American
History
✅
American
institutions
✅
lol
ikr
So
I
have
a
lot
of
requirements
already
met
,
I
am
just
looking
to
fufill
major
requirements
rather
than
graduation
requirements
.
[sskarz]
ah
so
general
ed
stuff
is
mainly
done
!
that
'
s
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
at
least
I
think
.
Watch
them
be
like
um
sorry
you
misread
,
you
are
still
missing
things
[sskarz]
my
advisor
everytime
I
visit
her
:
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
keeping
track
of
these
units
gets
so
unnecessarily
complicated
for
no
reason
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
and
going
into
high
school
with
no
middle
school
experience
,
jeez
I
thought
that
was
hard
and
then
college
classes
hit
and
I
was
like
...
[sskarz]
hahaha
you
know
,
personally
I
love
college
way
more
than
I
ever
did
with
high
school
[prabipyakurel]
yea
people
keep
telling
me
that
they
are
like
on
more
time
,
freedom
and
fun
[sskarz]
I
just
love
the
fact
that
I
get
to
choose
my
own
schedule
and
I
'
m
not
in
a
box
for
8
hours
continuously
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
some
very
specific
people
are
like
,
"
no
you
are
going
to
die
"
yea
I
think
thats
cool
tho
,
like
more
choices
[sskarz]
i
think
it
may
be
because
if
you
don
'
t
have
good
time
management
skills
,
then
its
really
hard
I
can
see
it
from
that
perspective
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
thats
what
I
was
thinking
[sskarz]
but
as
long
as
you
'
re
on
top
of
your
assignments
and
study
relatively
well
like
its
just
ez
pz
[prabipyakurel]
Right
EZ
PZ
💯
🤣
[sskarz]
i
mean
its
gonna
be
ez
pz
for
you
i
already
know
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
I
appreciate
it
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
like
einstein
out
here
haha
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
actually
never
knew
einstein
smoked
😮
[prabipyakurel]
me
neither
,
i
just
found
this
meme
😂
[sskarz]
the
more
you
know
i
guess
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
maybe
that
'
s
how
he
thought
of
the
theory
of
relativity
he
just
took
a
massive
hit
and
just
thought
of
it
🤔
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
I
saw
on
the
news
yesterday
that
they
found
cocaine
in
the
white
house
.
THen
I
was
like
oh
Biden
is
probably
stressed
[sskarz]
OH
YEAHHH
i
heard
about
that
today
morning
biden
out
here
just
SNIFFIN
jk
jk
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
crazy
things
be
happening
these
days
[sskarz]
right
like
that
submarine
incident
that
was
a
crazy
time
🤯
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
right
,
I
dont
know
personally
why
I
would
spend
so
much
money
to
look
at
a
wrecked
ship
,
but
people
got
goals
and
then
like
social
media
was
full
of
like
trolls
explaining
what
incident
[sskarz]
people
got
money
*
[prabipyakurel]
you
are
right
[sskarz]
like
I
think
I
'
d
understand
more
if
you
got
to
see
the
titanic
with
your
own
eyes
,
but
then
again
they
were
going
to
look
through
a
tiny
glass
hole
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[sskarz]
and
also
that
ship
was
just
extremely
poorly
built
[prabipyakurel]
yea
they
took
that
thing
for
another
trip
knowing
there
was
a
malfunction
and
a
defect
took
the
lives
of
like
6
people
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
yeah
I
feel
especially
bad
for
that
19
year
old
i
just
wish
he
wasn
'
t
on
that
[prabipyakurel]
yea
he
was
just
starting
life
,
was
your
age
.
[sskarz]
yeah
,
makes
me
sad
:
sadge
:
no
no
you
can
go
first
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
would
you
ever
go
shark
cage
diving
?
[sskarz]
HELL
NO
ok
listen
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
like
the
one
thing
that
I
would
back
out
from
[sskarz]
I
'
m
all
for
dangerous
things
trust
me
but
the
ocean
,
and
then
sharks
like
both
those
things
are
like
things
I
'
m
not
too
much
a
fan
of
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
cant
do
that
I
also
cant
swim
so
if
by
any
cance
the
cage
breaks
and
I
have
to
swim
up
by
myself
I
might
as
well
just
stop
trying
[sskarz]
ah
yeah
that
'
s
just
certain
death
I
think
I
would
just
die
from
shock
if
a
shark
was
just
attacking
my
cage
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
I
could
swim
out
but
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
you
are
lucky
you
might
be
able
to
escape
I
guess
but
I
would
rather
jump
without
a
bungee
rope
from
a
cliff
than
doing
that
[sskarz]
you
can
survive
technically
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
if
you
hit
the
trees
and
branches
to
break
your
fall
[prabipyakurel]
yes
exactly
,
but
the
shark
thing
,
no
chance
[sskarz]
and
also
all
of
your
bones
I
mean
[prabipyakurel]
well
there
is
that
too
[sskarz]
ok
to
really
break
it
down
:
100
%
chance
of
death
from
a
hungry
hungry
shark
or
90
%
chance
of
death
from
a
tall
fall
or
10
%
to
survive
but
be
paralyzed
like
everywhere
i
think
at
that
point
im
taking
the
shark
[prabipyakurel]
second
choice
thank
you
[sskarz]
there
was
a
story
of
how
a
guy
survived
a
fall
from
an
airplane
thousands
of
feet
in
the
air
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
also
comething
about
lage
bodies
of
water
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
'
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
people
get
real
lucky
omg
you
know
the
person
I
was
asking
about
a
while
back
,
wheater
you
knew
that
person
or
not
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
so
funny
story
...
I
was
like
barely
getting
used
to
discord
and
i
had
taken
a
cloud
computing
class
from
ELAC
and
this
persons
name
is
Kaiden
Hong
and
it
was
a
boy
but
the
entire
time
we
spent
4
months
sharing
answers
and
all
,
I
thought
it
was
a
girl
.
💀
[sskarz]
LMAO
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Like
the
name
was
gender
neutral
and
during
final
exam
we
were
comparing
answers
and
it
was
taking
too
long
and
he
was
like
can
i
just
call
and
we
can
screen
share
.
now
I
still
think
this
is
a
girl
and
then
he
called
and
then
I
picked
up
and
said
hi
...
and
the
deep
voice
was
like
"
hi
"
and
I
was
dead
[sskarz]
that
'
s
actually
hilarious
I
think
I
know
that
person
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
laughing
so
much
I
had
to
mute
and
close
video
and
text
him
that
I
was
gonna
get
water
real
quick
💀
[sskarz]
hold
on
I
have
to
check
my
instagram
,
I
think
I
have
him
followed
[prabipyakurel]
like
I
felt
so
dumb
for
just
assuming
he
was
a
girl
and
the
profile
picture
was
like
an
anime
girl
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
that
'
s
how
they
get
ya
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I
KNOW
HOW
I
KNOW
THIS
PERSONNNNNNN
so
basically
back
in
my
keppel
days
I
used
to
run
a
"
Gaming
Club
"
and
we
had
like
250
+
members
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
I
was
the
VP
and
I
used
to
run
stuff
like
events
and
meetings
and
what
not
[prabipyakurel]
damn
cool
[sskarz]
so
I
think
this
person
was
a
class
below
me
,
like
probably
sophomore
or
freshman
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
[sskarz]
and
that
was
most
of
our
roster
for
the
club
[prabipyakurel]
OHHHHH
lol
[sskarz]
and
I
think
that
was
one
of
the
people
that
signed
up
and
wanted
to
be
in
because
my
chat
history
is
referring
to
that
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
yea
it
was
just
a
dumb
experience
that
I
thought
would
be
funny
to
share
[sskarz]
it
was
pretty
funny
haha
[prabipyakurel]
ever
since
then
when
I
get
someones
discord
and
dont
know
their
gender
I
dont
assume
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
good
rule
of
thumb
I
have
a
friend
that
is
a
guy
,
but
he
has
like
a
thin
figure
and
long
hair
and
this
one
time
,
we
were
walking
out
of
the
AMC
theaters
from
watching
the
new
spiderman
movie
and
so
we
both
go
to
the
mens
restroom
[prabipyakurel]
oh
[sskarz]
as
I
was
washing
my
hands
,
and
my
friend
is
walking
out
,
these
2
kids
stare
at
him
and
say
,
"
you
know
this
is
the
mens
restroom
right
?"
and
right
then
,
I
just
had
to
pause
and
look
at
them
for
a
second
,
but
then
I
finally
realized
and
I
just
started
laughing
my
friend
didn
'
t
take
any
offense
but
it
was
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
yea
sometimes
I
look
at
people
with
long
hair
and
go
,
so
..
are
you
a
dude
or
a
gal
[sskarz]
I
do
like
to
ask
for
clarity
these
days
[prabipyakurel]
I
mistook
a
girl
for
a
dude
before
and
had
to
wait
for
the
teacher
to
say
her
for
me
to
find
out
[sskarz]
its
like
the
feeling
when
you
'
re
talking
to
a
new
person
and
they
say
their
name
but
you
don
'
t
catch
it
then
,
so
you
have
to
wait
till
someone
else
says
their
name
to
figure
it
out
idk
if
that
'
s
just
me
tho
[prabipyakurel]
yea
this
happens
a
lot
no
its
not
just
you
i
thought
it
was
just
me
[sskarz]
no
definitely
not
,
I
feel
like
my
hearing
is
just
terrible
so
it
happens
sometimes
I
'
m
gonna
go
eat
some
lunch
,
I
'
m
starving
lol
I
'
ll
talk
to
you
later
!
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
me
too
,
ttyl
.
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
when
I
have
a
science
class
in
college
,
that
will
be
me
.

stupid
and

wrong
things
then

but
no
practice
means
no
perfect
[sskarz]
i
mean
the
first
time
i
tried
to
make
eggs
it
was
some
of
the
most
vile
food
i
’
ve
made
the
training
arc
about
to
go
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
you
can
make
a
lot
of
things
using
eggs
.
[sskarz]
but
it
was
literally
just
eggs
by
itself
💀
[prabipyakurel]
like
boiled
?
[sskarz]
well
no
not
the
first
time
it
was
on
a
pan
[prabipyakurel]
oh
how
old
were
you
?
[sskarz]
like
13
[prabipyakurel]
I
wasnt
allowed
near
the
fire
and
kitchen
until
I
was
like
12
either
[sskarz]
yeah
same
[prabipyakurel]
pretty
decent
age
[sskarz]
i
like
baking
more
than
cooking
though
[prabipyakurel]
yea
me
too
[sskarz]
like
baking
banana
bread
or
chocolate
chip
cookies
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
making
cheesecakes
,
they
are
amazing
and
easy
[sskarz]
oooooh
that
’
s
amazing
!
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
made
cookies
,
but
not
banana
bread
[sskarz]
have
you
ever
had
banana
bread
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
not
a
big
fan
of
it
,
but
a
little
amount
is
good
[sskarz]
ah
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
I
make
banana
pancakes
often
though
[sskarz]
oh
that
’
s
something
I
haven
’
t
heard
of
[prabipyakurel]
try
it
,
its
just
mashed
bananas
and
eggs
put
on
a
pan
[sskarz]
sounds
pretty
good
gonna
put
it
on
my
baking
to
do
list
lol
[prabipyakurel]
nice
,
are
you
one
of
those
that
hates
pineapples
on
pizza
?
[sskarz]
oh
nah
I
love
pineapples
on
pizza
[prabipyakurel]
oh
okay
,
me
too
🔥
💯
[sskarz]
literally
so
good
[prabipyakurel]
some
uncultured
people
out
there
think
fruit
doesnt
belong
on
pizza
.
[sskarz]
fr
fr
some
of
them
are
actually
pretty
good
on
pizza
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
but
like
olives
and
mushrooms
are
gross
everything
else
is
fine
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
I
have
finally
found
someone
that
shares
the
same
views
as
me
about
mushrooms
everyone
in
my
family
loves
mushrooms
except
me
[prabipyakurel]
same
here
I
like
cant
even
like
put
it
in
my
mouth
,
it
makes
me
sick
[sskarz]
idk
maybe
its
because
as
a
child
i
thought
all
mushrooms
were
toxic
but
like
even
after
trying
to
so
many
times
the
texture
is
just
nasty
[prabipyakurel]
yea
ikr
[sskarz]
sameeee
[prabipyakurel]
what
are
your
thoughts
on
eggplants
?
[sskarz]
they
’
re
aight
like
I
won
’
t
go
out
of
my
way
for
them
but
if
its
on
there
then
I
’
m
just
“
eh
”
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
cant
handle
eating
those
either
[sskarz]
I
can
definitely
see
that
[prabipyakurel]
i
think
mushrooms
,
olives
,
and
eggplants
are
the
most
disgusting
things
on
the
planet
.
[sskarz]
definitely
isn
’
t
anywhere
near
my
favorite
or
I
would
even
choose
it
out
of
any
other
option
that
’
s
fair
tbh
olives
to
me
just
have
no
taste
[prabipyakurel]
meh
yea
,
if
they
are
chopped
up
real
good
and
put
in
something
they
dont
matter
to
me
but
if
the
are
like
those
whole
ones
or
sliced
,
i
just
cant
i
have
to
remove
them
[sskarz]
same
same
ok
but
how
about
the
opposite
spectrum
favorite
foods
?
Nepali
food
or
any
kind
of
food
from
any
culture
[prabipyakurel]
momo
[sskarz]
I
think
Chicken
Tikka
Masala
with
Garlic
Naan
is
like
in
my
top
3
[prabipyakurel]
by
far
the
best
[sskarz]
ok
valid
valid
[prabipyakurel]
thats
good
,
butter
paneer
and
chicken
are
both
amazing
indian
and
nepali
food
is
like
better
than
the
food
here
tbh
[sskarz]
oh
100
percent
[prabipyakurel]
it
feels
like
home
[sskarz]
idk
if
I
told
u
this
but
when
I
was
on
my
trip
with
my
sister
,
we
both
got
sick
of
French
food
so
we
just
went
to
a
Nepali
restaurant
and
got
thakali
lol
its
just
comfort
food
tbh
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
saw
it
on
her
story
we
do
that
,
when
we
went
to
vegas
,
it
was
my
family
and
like
3
other
family
,
or
my
cousins
,
and
after
looking
at
the
menu
of
random
restaurants
,
we
looked
for
the
closest
indian
one
and
it
was
like
heaven
.
[sskarz]
yesssssss
💯
Indian
and
Nepali
food
always
hit
the
spot
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
and
people
here
find
it
weird
to
eat
rice
with
hands
but
ot
doesnt
hit
it
with
the
spoon
.
[sskarz]
my
dad
still
eats
rice
with
his
hands
to
this
day
lol
its
pretty
normal
idk
[prabipyakurel]
yea
mines
too
,
I
have
never
ever
ever
,
unless
we
are
at
an
event
,
eat
rice
with
a
spoon
[sskarz]
I
eat
with
a
spoon
just
because
I
don
’
t
like
having
stuff
on
my
hands
but
yeah
its
normal
[prabipyakurel]
mhm

the
time
I

on
it
[sskarz]
I
saw
that
and
also
went
to
get
a
snack
[prabipyakurel]
yep
,
i
do
that
to
myself
a
lot
,
I
watch
food
videos
and
wonder
why
i
did
that
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
that
'
s
dangerous
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
like
mukbangs
when
you
'
re
hungry
[prabipyakurel]
yea
not
like
the
sea
food
ones
,
like
the
ones
with
actual
junk
food
[sskarz]
yeahhhhhhhh
do
you
like
seafood
?
or
like
sushi
[prabipyakurel]
i
think
shimp
is
okay
I
love
sushi
💯
but
like
the
simple
one
is
the
best
[sskarz]
like
california
roll
type
sushi
?
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
ah
that
'
s
pretty
good
[prabipyakurel]
like
the
ones
with
fish
eggs
or
raw
salmon
on
top
dont
seem
too
appetizing
to
me
are
you
fine
with
sushi
?
[sskarz]
yeah
I
love
sushi
I
like
going
to
those
conveyer
belt
sushi
places
[prabipyakurel]
ohhh
yea
we
usually
just
tell
my
dad
to
bring
it
at
home
for
us
,
we
went
to
the
ones
with
the
conveyer
belt
like
once
.
pretty
fun
ngl
[sskarz]
oh
yeahhhhhh
go
with
friends
,
its
some
of
the
most
fun
you
can
have
and
its
relatively
cheap
too
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
need
to
start
doing
that
[sskarz]
in
college
my
buddies
and
I
would
usually
go
to
this
sushi
place
in
Little
Tokyo
it
'
s
always
a
good
time
plus
they
got
like
these
rice
balls
[prabipyakurel]
oh
that
sounds
fun
[sskarz]
have
you
been
to
little
tokyo
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
we
have
passed
through
it
on
our
way
to
china
town
[sskarz]
oh
definitely
go
there
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
its
small
*
obviously
*
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
for
sure
,
yea
sushi
is
amazing
[sskarz]
but
lots
of
really
good
food
and
they
got
an
arcade
there
too
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
nice
nice
do
you
like
dried
seaweed
[sskarz]
my
mom
loves
those
it
tastes
alright
imo
[prabipyakurel]
yea
everyone
likes
those
,
but
I
dont
like
them
if
it
is
with
something
I
like
it
,
but
just
that
dry
thing
alone
tastes
wierd
?
[sskarz]
yeah
some
people
swear
by
it
tho
[prabipyakurel]
fr
[sskarz]
like
I
have
a
friend
,
she
will
literally
prefer
dried
seaweed
over
any
kind
of
chips
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yes
there
are
those
people
who
sit
with
just
that
for
lunch
and
are
like
its
my
lunch
[sskarz]
idk
how
they
do
it
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
its
because
we
arent
used
to
it
eating
something
like
that
for
lunch
all
the
time
so
[sskarz]
that
'
s
tru
[prabipyakurel]
like
my
parents
are
like
rice
rice
rice
that
is
the
only
thing
to
fill
you
and
not
make
you
sick
[sskarz]
*
i
mean
they
aren
'
t
wrong
*
rice
has
a
lot
of
carbs
so
it
makes
you
full
pretty
quick
[prabipyakurel]
yea
you
still
laying
in
bed
[sskarz]
nah
I
'
m
on
my
desktop
now
,
just
waiting
for
my
packages
to
arrive
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhh
i
see
[sskarz]
like
I
am
just
staring
at
my
amazon
home
page
refreshing
to
see
where
my
delivery
driver
is
💀
stressing
me
outtttttttttt
[prabipyakurel]
lol
my
dad
does
that
with
important
things
dw
,
just
forget
about
it
for
a
while
and
it
will
be
there
in
no
time
its
likes
ignoring
a
loading
page
so
it
loads
faster
[sskarz]
im
the
kind
of
person
where
like
if
i
order
something
a
few
days
before
,
that
'
s
the
only
thing
that
i
think
of
till
i
get
that
delivery
i
have
no
idea
why
[prabipyakurel]
no
its
alright
,
if
there
is
my
money
involved
in
something
I
would
stress
over
it
as
well
[sskarz]
yeah
,
I
'
m
building
a
new
computer
from
the
ground
up
,
so
I
'
m
just
grinding
my
teeth
hoping
my
parts
don
'
t
come
damaged
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
sounds
cool
,
i
love
putting
things
together
and
working
with
like
wires
[sskarz]
😮
you
'
re
amazing
I
love
building
computers
and
I
'
m
finally
getting
the
chance
to
customize
my
own
workstation
I
'
ve
been
waiting
to
do
this
for
like
7
years
now
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yea
there
was
this
time
in
physics
where
we
had
wires
and
batteries
to
make
the
bulb
light
up
and
i
kept
doing
things
that
I
wasnt
supposed
to
and
the
bulb
just
stopped
working
.
Thank
you
That
is
honeslty
so
amazing
,
you
need
to
show
mw
how
it
looks
once
its
done
.
[sskarz]
YESSSSSSS
im
so
excited
its
gonna
be
so
cool
[prabipyakurel]
no
you
should
be
,
that
is
something
to
loook
forward
to
[sskarz]
yeah
the
whole
reason
I
got
into
where
I
am
today
is
because
I
asked
my
dad
if
I
could
build
one
when
I
was
12
and
then
like
7
years
later
I
can
finally
do
it
since
I
saved
up
enough
👍
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
you
have
been
so
brilliant
since
you
were
a
kid
u
at
5
years
old
[sskarz]
no
no
no
I
'
m
just
a
very
curious
person
haha
always
have
been
curiosity
is
like
the
drive
of
my
life
[prabipyakurel]
thats
awesome
,
you
must
be
like
ahead
all
your
peers
in
college
too
huh
like
you
had
that
background
knowledge
of
comp
sci
before
starting
your
major
[sskarz]
only
in
career
wise
I
would
say
but
even
then
,
there
'
s
a
lot
of
people
in
my
classes
that
are
BRILLIANT
and
I
'
m
just
in
awe
every
time
that
'
s
what
happens
when
passion
turns
into
career
I
guess
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
yea
its
just
amazing
[sskarz]
You
want
to
become
a
lawyer
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
yes
sir
[sskarz]
what
made
you
wanna
become
a
lawyer
out
of
curiosity
?
[prabipyakurel]
um
when
I
was
like
in
5th
grade
or
sixth
grade
we
had
to
make
presentations
about
careers
and
I
think
I
chose
lawyer
/
attoney
because
I
knew
what
it
was
but
was
curious
and
the
more
I
researched
the
more
I
learned
and
since
there
is
research
and
writing
involved
and
communications
,
i
was
like
okay
this
is
what
I
am
good
at
and
will
love
to
do
everyday
.
Also
I
kind
of
want
to
help
people
with
the
problems
.
[sskarz]
Your
honor
,
my
lawyer
is
ballin
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
really
awesome
though
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
love
arguing
so
that
is
also
something
😂
[sskarz]
DEBATE
CLASSSSSSSSSSSS
one
of
my
favorite
classes
ever
[prabipyakurel]
omg
i
realized
instead
of
acadec
i
should
have
joined
speecha
nd
debate
I
made
a
mistake
of
now
switching
early
hopefully
I
can
take
a
similar
class
at
berkeley
[sskarz]
acadec
gave
you
good
work
ethic
tho
I
imagine
being
in
that
club
made
me
realize
just
how
much
more
work
you
had
to
manage
back
in
keppel
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
yea
taught
me
how
to
condense
large
amounts
of
info
into
parts
that
i
can
understand
keppel
was
just
keppel
that
school
made
me
feel
dumb
everytime
I
walked
in
you
were
in
acadec
too
right
?
[sskarz]
yeah
just
for
a
year
it
was
...
I
had
more
work
from
acadec
than
any
of
my
6
classes
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
thats
how
I
felt
freshmen
year
too
like
for
the
1st
week
or
so
I
was
like
"
why
did
I
do
this
"
but
the
teacher
was
nice
and
got
used
to
it
but
because
of
acadec
I
know
2
people
at
berkeley
so
there
is
that
too
[sskarz]
ayy
nice
!
so
you
got
some
familiar
faces
already
hopefully
that
makes
the
transition
easier
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
does
,
its
crazy
,
they
are
both
majoring
in
astro
-
physics
which
sounds
painful
just
by
the
names
of
it
.
[sskarz]
oh
my
I
salute
them
🫡
I
wish
I
had
enough
brainpower
to
do
anything
physics
related
I
took
physics
1
and
absolutely
hated
every
second
of
it
but
damn
I
love
the
concepts
,
just
none
of
the
math
💀
[prabipyakurel]
yea
me
too
,
everyday
salute
i
took
regular
physics
and
loved
the
experiments
but
hated
the
math
math
is
deadly
[sskarz]
same
the
experiments
were
fun
*
except
the
really
long
lab
reports
*
[prabipyakurel]
mhm

height

2
)
Only

Future

the
past

entire
tiktok
page

with
this
account
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
pretty
straight
forward
answers
can
you
dance
?
[sskarz]
i
mean
maybe
some
of
my
answers
change
if
i
think
about
it
for
a
while
but
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
or
how
well
do
you
dance
?
[sskarz]

brain

bogus
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
heard
of
that
[sskarz]
but
for
some
reason
i
believe
that
im
just
all
left
brain
and
zero
right
brain
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
also
good
luck
on
building
that
computer
thats
a
lot
of
different
parts
[sskarz]
im
so
resisting
the
urge
to
just
build
it
now
instead
of
waiting
till
tomorrow
lol
finally
got
all
the
parts
,
feeling
like
a
kid
that
got
his
favorite
gift
on
christmas
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
you
can
take
a
SMALL
peak
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
how
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
extremely
sorry
,
I
didn
'
t
mean
to
ignore
you
,
my
dad
brought
indian
sweets
and
I
was
in
the
kitchen
devouring
them
.
My
day
was
pretty
chill
I
had
a
talk
with
my
advisor
in
the
morning
and
basically
just
followed
up
on
emails
and
things
throughout
the
day
.
I
cleaned
my
room
and
just
watched
TV
.
Not
too
boring
today
.
currently
just
doing
this
for
fun
U
still
there
,
I
’
m
sorry
.
[sskarz]
hey
!
sorry
I
didn
'
t
get
to
respond
I
had
dog
issues
I
needed
to
attend
to
No
no
you
'
re
completely
fine
,
no
need
to
apologize
at
all
!
Sounds
like
your
day
went
swimmingly
tho
nice
❤
️
For
context
,
bear
was
just
being
really
sad
tonight
and
my
sister
and
I
had
to
basically
give
therapy
and
treats
to
convince
him
to
go
outside
to
go
pee
and
poop
and
what
not
and
he
is
very
emotional
so
it
took
a
VERY
long
time
to
convince
him
hey
that
'
s
pretty
good
speed
,
do
you
know
how
to
type
qwerty
?
Again
nothing
against
you
,
sorry
I
didn
'
t
get
to
you
,
hopefully
you
didn
'
t
think
anything
otherwise
[prabipyakurel]
Your
dog
okay
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
he
'
s
okay
,
he
cheered
up
after
a
couple
treats
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
omg
I
hope
he
is
okay
[sskarz]
yeah
he
'
s
all
good
:
D
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
What
is
QWERTY
?
[sskarz]
it
'
s
like
a
typing
style
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
’
s
alright
,
I
thought
you
just
stopped
responding
and
I
was
like
oh
shoot
But
it
’
s
fine
Kay
[sskarz]
some
people
call
it
"
proper
typing
"
but
tbh
whatever
is
comfortable
to
a
person
is
their
own
typing
dw
I
don
'
t
like
leaving
people
on
read
,
I
find
it
weird
personally
I
usually
respond
within
a
20
minute
time
unless
I
am
doing
something
that
takes
more
attention
to
idk
if
that
helps
you
in
any
way
but
yeah
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yea
I
understand
Lol
it
’
s
alright
I
am
assuming
you
typing
speed
is
higher
than
average
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
btw
I
found
the
movie
you
were
talking
about
earlier
on
youtube
Yeah
but
its
slowed
down
over
the
years
they
trained
me
in
middle
school
for
2
years
to
type
in
QWERTY
and
my
highest
ever
was
146
Words
Per
Minute
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
,
you
can
always
watch
the
trailer
first
dAMN
,
wow
🤩
[sskarz]
but
nowadays
i
feel
like
an
old
man
my
hands
are
not
as
fast
as
they
used
to
be
:(
*
also
lack
of
practice
but
we
don
'
t
talk
about
that
*
yeah
it
looks
really
interesting
,
gonna
watch
that
late
at
night
sometime
[prabipyakurel]
Calm
down
you
are
19
Yea
that
’
s
the
best
time
to
watch
it
[sskarz]
im
like
right
there
on
the
mid
life
crisis
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
soon
be
in
the
at
position
next
year
[sskarz]
speaking
of
age
,
when
is
your
birthday
?
[prabipyakurel]
April

[sskarz]

very
late
birthday
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
thank
you
🙏
[sskarz]
you
know
we
talked
about
food
yesterday
but
i
forgot
to
ask
the
major
question
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
favorite
ice
cream
flavor
?
[prabipyakurel]
Mint
But
others
are
okay
I
don
’
t

I
hate
U
?
[sskarz]

lol
tho
my
sister
swears
that
it
tastes
like
toothepaste
mint
chocolate
chip
is
usually
my
go
to
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

my
parents
say

like
toothpaste
too
It
’
s
so
good
tho
[sskarz]
right
?!
i
sound
crazy
to
my
entire
family
💀
[prabipyakurel]
🤣
It
’
s
so
relatable
I
am
surprised
we
have
so
much
in
common
,
aside
from
the
fact
that
I
don
’
t
watch
anime
or
pay
video
games
.
Pretty
cool
[sskarz]
i
was
about
to
say
❤
️
*
maybe
you
just
gotta
find
the
right
anime
*
jk
jk
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
isn
'
t
your
brother
super
into
anime
?
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[sskarz]
*
its
that
bad
huh
*
hahaha
seems
like
only
one
sibling
of
the
2
likes
anime
on
both
sides
here
my
sister
also
doesn
'
t
like
any
anime
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
just
when
he
started
watching
there
were
some
that
he
used
to
put
on
and
let
’
s
just
say
it
was
not
so
appropriate
😬
I
love
her
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
yep
I
can
definitely
see
why
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
Your
Honor
,
my
defendant
,
your
brother
,
is
innocent
on
the
counts
of
,
"
he
simply
chose
the
wrong
anime
to
watch
"
😂
[prabipyakurel]
He
knew
what
he
was
doing
,
it
wasn
’
t
too
long
ago
[sskarz]
My
defendant
pleads
guilty
,
case
over
*
gavel
hits
*
*
i
have
no
idea
how
court
of
law
works
,
i
just
know
from
what
i
see
in
movies
*
[prabipyakurel]
Something
like
that
,
I
will
eventually
learn
and
correct
you
[sskarz]
Please
do
,
before
I
stand
as
a
witness
and
I
slip
up
💀
[prabipyakurel]
😆
[sskarz]
I
'
m
a
great
talker
,
a
bad
liar
tho
its
over
for
me
if
I
'
m
in
court
[prabipyakurel]
courtroom
madness
I
wanna
experience
this
When
I
become
an
attorney
[sskarz]
i
actually
saw
recent
news
of
something
like
this
happening
the
DRAMAAAAAA
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
search
up
the
court
cases
with
the
most
tea
It
’
s
like
a
kid
in
a
candy
store
What
time
do
you
usually
go
to
bed
?
[sskarz]
usually
by
like
11
:
30pm
if
I
want
to
stay
up
,
if
not
then
like
around
10
:
00pm
if
I
want
to
wake
up
super
early
to
do
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
[sskarz]
parents
left
for
vacation
so
I
'
m
chilling
out
a
bit
wbu
?
I
hope
I
'
m
not
keeping
you
awake
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
no
,
this
whole
summer
thing
has
me
awake
until
like
1
Dw
about
it
[sskarz]
ah
gotcha
okay
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
just
tossing
and
turning
in
bed
,
because
my
brain
is
telling
me
to
go
to
sleep
but
I
literally
can
’
t
💀
[sskarz]
you
should
just
slowly
close
your
eyes
,
take
a
deep
breath
,
and
then
😴
💤
do
you
go
to
sleep
easily
?
[prabipyakurel]
Usually
when
I
have
a
long
day
and
am
tired
yes
If
I
haven
’
t
done
much
,
I
like
to
watch
something
or
do
something
to
get
me
tired
[sskarz]
ah
okay
so
pretty
normal
stuff
I
say
that
because
a
lot
of
my
friends
suffer
from
insomnia
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
not
suffering
from
insomnia
here
Yea
I
have
friends
that
need
to
take
like
sleeping
gummies
They
stay
up
watching
anime
👀
[sskarz]
ahhhhhhh
that
takes
me
backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
👍
to
my
youth
:(((
jk
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
said
you
are
just
19
[sskarz]
i
also
said
the
midlife
crisis
is
almost
approaching
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Meh
ig
[sskarz]
nah
im
just
joking
👍
i
guess
that
'
s
not
a
bad
idea
as
long
as
you
don
'
t
build
a
tolerance
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
can
be
a
bad
thing
[sskarz]
yeah
pretty
bad
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
try
it
[sskarz]
oh
no
I
never
take
sleeping
pills
ever
unless
I
get
sick
or
some
extraordinary
reason
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
me
neither
,
usually
when
I
am
sick
I
fall
asleep
easier
I
don
’
t
know
if
that
is
only
me
tho
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
sleep
with
a
stuffy
nose
[prabipyakurel]
Ooo
those
suck
I
hate
it
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
would
suffocate
if
I
tried
to
sleep
with
that
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
same
here
[sskarz]
yeah
its
bad
[prabipyakurel]
I
need
to
clear
my
nose
before
bed
It
’
s
like
not
being
able
to
breathe
Then
I
have
to
like
get
up
midway
and
breathe
properly
[sskarz]
mhm
mhm
yep
exactly
why
I
use
sleeping
pills
for
that
occassion
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
that
makes
sense
Do
you
have
like
nightmares
when
u
are
sick
?
[sskarz]
hmmmmm
maybe
more
often
than
not
?
I
don
'
t
usually
get
nightmares
,
but
if
I
do
,
then
I
wake
up
in
a
cold
sweat
and
its
like
lucid
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
sometimes
I
like
just
freak
out
and
wake
up
thinking
someone
is
watching
me
but
there
is
like
nothing
there
.
And
other
times
I
wake
up
because
my
body
does
that
fake
fall
thing
in
bed
.
Don
’
t
know
if
that
has
ever
happened
to
you
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
I
know
that
feeling
far
too
well
the
fake
fall
thingy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
’
s
weird
So
random
[sskarz]
i
can
only
lucid
dream
nightmares
😭
i
swear
those
feel
way
too
real
compared
to
every
other
dream
can
you
lucid
dream
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lucid
dreams
is
kind
of
rare
for
me
,
I
have
experienced
it
like
once
or
twice
where
I
am
like
I
know
I
am
in
a
dream
but
won
’
t
wake
up
.
Kinda
creepy
But
it
happens
[sskarz]
wait
are
you
maybe
talking
about
sleep
paralysis
👀
wait
no
sleep
paralysis
happens
when
you
wake
up
...
i
think
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
sure
Sleep
paralysis
is
when
you
can
’
t
move
knowing
that
you
are
in
a
dream
and
need
to
wake
up
Something
like
that
[sskarz]
ah
I
'
ve
only
experienced
that
like
once
and
it
was
at
Keppel
ironically
*
the
real
nightmare
*
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wait
I
think
I
remember
you
telling
me
about
being
at
keppels
nurses
office
[sskarz]
oh
so
I
did
tell
you
?
yeah
it
was
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
at
our
old
house
that
one
time
you
came
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
my
memory
is
fading
:
spinny
:
[prabipyakurel]
Mines
been
fading
buddy
,
it
’
s
okay
[sskarz]
see
this
is
the
exact
reason
why
i
wanted
that
memory
super
power
from
that
tiktok
i
sent
you
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
for
sure
I
remember
the
most
random
thing
from
somewhere
Like
I
swear
my
cousins
house
in
Nepal
I
can
clearly
visualize
that
their
bathroom
had
blue
and
white
tiles
and
I
said
that
last
time
they
called
and
they
were
like
“
oh
okay
”.
[sskarz]
woah
that
'
s
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
weird
and
when
I
left
Nepal
I
was
like
6
[sskarz]
that
'
s
insane
!
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
call
myself
that
everyday
🤣
[sskarz]

be
a
little
insane
to
think
farther
or

like
that
👍

born
here

️
I
think
you
might
be
the
first
Nepali
person
that
I
have
talked
to
in
Nepali
over
text
.
Aside
from
my
parents
of
course
.
[sskarz]
oh
you
text
your
parents
in
Nepali
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
occasionally
[sskarz]
ah
that
'
s
cool
,
this
was
also
my
first
time
commiting
an
entire
conversation
in
text
in
Nepali
❤
️
so
I
was
trying
to
sound
out
the
words
and
type
them
out
the
entire
time
😅
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
do
that
and
it
sometimes
auto
corrects
into
a
whole
another
word
[sskarz]
yeah
autocorrect
can
be
a
nightmare
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
it
’
s
really
good
,
I
need
to
hear
you
speak
and
next
time
we
see
each
other
I
will
start
in
Nepali
👍
(
2
)
[sskarz]
omg
i
saw
spanish
and
i
panicked
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
ik
it
’
s
because
when
I
took
Spanish
in
he
,
everyone
that
spoke
Spanish
with
I
would
switch
back
and
forth
You
wanna
try
Spanish
[sskarz]
oh
god
no
[prabipyakurel]
How
well
do
u
know
?
[sskarz]
yo
soy

[sskarz]

dinner
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

what
you
said
?

i
still
have
it
in
me
I
can
understand
spanish
,
but
its
tough
for
me
to
speak
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yo

Paletas
Yea
I
have
the
problem
too
Dw
I
am
not
fluent
I
can
like
speak
broken
Spanish
which
I
will
probably
forget
once
in
college
[sskarz]
you
ate
rice
and
eggs
with
a
popsicle
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
Omg
hey
[sskarz]
ok
ok
so
i
still
remember
a
bit
didn
'
t
you

4
years
of

?
[prabipyakurel]

re

[prabipyakurel]
Mines

incorporating
different

'
s

👍
I
wish
I
could
do
that
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
try
,
it
’
s
like
a
mix
Who

Nepali
and
a
good
one

'
t
forget
any
spanish
[prabipyakurel]
We

will
be
quite
interesting
🧐
Do
you
know
how
to
write
and
read
in
Nepali
?
[sskarz]
I
used
to
when
I
was
a
small
child
,
I
was
in
a
Nepali
school
but
as
a
little
brat
,
I
chose
not
to
keep
learning
[prabipyakurel]
A
Nepali
school
?
[sskarz]
yeah
here
in
the
US
my
parents
enrolled
me
in
one
[prabipyakurel]
Ah
no
worries
,
it
’
s
alright
[sskarz]
so
like
I
know
some
of
the
letters
👍
but
yeah
I
wish
I
kept
learning
[prabipyakurel]
I
Didn
’
t
know
that
wow
Yea
when
my
grandpa
came
he
taught
us
the
alphabets
and
we
can
write
like
a
few
words
or
so
[sskarz]
are
you
fluent
in
writing
and
reading
in
Nepali
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
used
to
,
I
finished
half
of
first
grade
there
,
but
then
I
got
used
to
everything
here
and
it
became
worse
and
worse
I
can
get
reading
,
it
takes
some
time
tho
[sskarz]
oh
thats
cool
!
👍
I
'
m
praying
that
some
big
tech
company
comes
out
with
a
live
translating
lens
that
can
read
it
lol
otherwise
its
uh
...

not
possible
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Don

possible
for
you

got
your
Microsoft
thingy

I
'
ve
been
waiting
on
a
sunset
,
Bills
on
my
mindset
I
can
'
t
deny
they
'
re
getting
high
Higher
than
my
income
,
income
'
s
bread
crumbs
I
'
ve
been
trying
to
survive
The
glow
that
sun
gets
right
around
sunset
helps
me
to
realize
This
i
...

[sskarz]
hey
good
morning
!
☀
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
just
woke
up
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
been
awake
,
was
in
the
shower
Like
last
night
I
was
talking
to
you
and
then
I
was
like
slowly
falling
asleep
so
I
said
good
night
before
I
passed
out
and
left
you
hanging
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
glad
the
sleep
came
easily
tho
👍
Hope
it
wasn
’
t
too
late
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
wasn
’
t
.
I
usually
have
to
like
sit
in
bed
for
an
hour
or
2
before
falling
asleep
[sskarz]
O
rip
👍
I
’
ve
been
trying
my
friends
sleep
schedule
of
sleeping
at
6
am
and
waking
up
at
like
1
pm
afternoon
Just
to
see
what
it
’
s
like
Haven
’
t
been
able
to
get
past
4
am
without
literally
falling
apart
lol
Last
night
I
got
to
2
am
but
no
luck
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
do
that
,
it
is
most
likely
gonna
mess
you
up
You
slept
at
2
last
night
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
but
I
passed
out
pretty
quick
just
trying
new
things
while
I
can
,
can
’
t
try
it
while
in
semester
lol
tho
I
’
m
most
definitely
a
morning
person
I
’
m
coming
to
find
out
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
me
too
,
I
find
it
easier
to
get
work
done
in
the
mornings
than
night
Unless
I
am
like
out
at
a
party
or
something
,
then
late
is
okay
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
here
Can
’
t
say
the
same
for
my
peers
tho
lol
got
any
plans
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
not
really
,
probably
going
to
watch
a
tv
show
.
But
you
have
a
big
day
today
huh
?
[sskarz]
it
’
s
gonna
be
a
fun
day
started
the
day
with
a
2
hour
gym
session
but
I
just
realized
I
need
to
get
some
groceries
and
tools
so
gonna
be
doing
that
👍
Ooo
Pakistani
drama
?
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
I
have
never
gone
to
the
gym
,
I
feel
like
I
don
'
t
need
it
.
But
I
will
probably
start
in
college
.
Take
advantage
of
the
money
I
pay
for
Berkeley
.
💯
No
this
is
a
hindi
show
,
its
like
a
comedy
type
show
,
to
binge
watch
.
[sskarz]
You
should
!
It
’
s
not
just
weightlifting
either
,
tons
of
stuff
to
get
active
👍
Helps
me
mentally
and
physically
so
it
’
s
a
no
brainer
for
me
Oh
what
’
s
the
name
?
[prabipyakurel]
MHm
yea
for
sure
,
watch
me
not
know
how
to
use
anything
🤣
Tarak
Metha
Ka
Oltha
Chashma
Its
such
a
long
name
[sskarz]
Dw
it
’
s
not
complicated
at
all
hahaha
Oooo
okay
[prabipyakurel]
yea
you
probably
have
never
seen
it
[sskarz]
Ngl
I
’
m
not
too
familiar
with
Hindi
shows
these
days
[prabipyakurel]
this
has
been
running
for
13
years
i
believe
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
watch
Aapka
colours
anymore
💀
[prabipyakurel]
you
shoudl
recognize
some
characters
if
you
watch
indian
stuff
growing
up
[sskarz]
Yeah
probably
seen
it
somewhere
unlocked
a
core
memory
with
this
tv
station
name
lol
[prabipyakurel]
this
thing
damn
yea
those
childhood
shows
with
too
many
drama
i
swear
indian
movies
and
shows
have
so
much
dumb
transitions
and
are
so
dumb
[sskarz]
Ohhh
it
feels
familiar
[prabipyakurel]
if
you
have
ever
watched
them
,
they
be
sooo
dramatic
mhm
[sskarz]
Fr
😂
[prabipyakurel]
This
is
why
I
watch
pakistani
dramas
more
at
least
they
arent
this
dramatic
You
dont
watch
any
hindi
shows
rn
?
[sskarz]
Not
at
the
moment
,
I
usually
just
watch
stuff
with
my
mom
whenever
she
is
I
used
to
back
when
I
was
a
kid
but
definitely
not
near
that
frequency
nowadays
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
see
isee
[sskarz]
tbh
now
that
I
think
about
it
,
I
haven
’
t
really
binged
a
show
in
a
really
long
time
Idk
why
[prabipyakurel]
thats
all
i
do
when
I
am
too
lazy
to
indulge
myself
in
anything
new
no
it
happens
SO
what
are
you
doing
rn
?
[sskarz]
I
just
came
back
home
from
the
gym
like
20
mins
ago
and
took
a
shower
so
…
I
’
m
about
to
figure
that
out
now
Oh
wait
nvm
I
did
say
groceries
and
tools
so
there
we
go
And
probably
have
lunch
somewhere
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
[sskarz]
yeah
everything
is
kind
of
in
the
air
rn
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
days
I
have
to
really
think
about
what
I
can
do
for
the
day
and
some
days
I
am
like
"
how
am
i
gonna
get
everything
done
today
"
[sskarz]
especially
during
summer
time
,
gotten
so
used
to
just
doing
assignments
and
studying
hard
for
the
past
couple
months
and
now
I
’
m
like
,
hmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
RIGHT
,
I
feel
like
I
did
nothing
productive
and
feel
useless
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
i
swear
like
everyday
in
the
summer
[sskarz]
Yeahhhh
Actually
I
was
feeling
like
that
a
lot
a
week
ago
And
so
I
’
m
trying
something
new
out
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
teach
little
kids
too
no
?
[sskarz]
Yup
,
and
I
’
m
secretary
for
the
biggest
club
in
CSULA
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
hey
congrats
!!!!
[sskarz]
so
usually
I
would
be
swarmed
with
work
but
they
went
easy
on
me
this
week
😅
Thanks
!
So
it
’
s
just
a
slow
week
,
im
sure
they
will
give
me
like
20
million
tasks
and
meetings
next
week
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
prepare
yourself
over
the
weekend
I
guess
[sskarz]
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
which
club
is
it
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
called
ACM
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Associates
for
Computing
Machinery
I
believe
is
what
it
stands
for
we
help
students
land
internships
and
we
host
lots
and
lots
of
events
👍
[prabipyakurel]
lol
went
snooping
[sskarz]
I
just
wanted
to
have
some
leadership
on
the
resume
so
I
decided
to
run
for
secretary
and
won
Haha
yup
there
we
go
[prabipyakurel]
found
it
,
thats
pretty
cool
,
i
had
a
guess
it
would
be
something
technical
I
think
I
saw
this
that
one
time
I
visited
Cal
State
LA
for
on
the
spot
admissions
[sskarz]
yup
you
know
me
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
yeah
it
’
s
a
pretty
good
chance
It
’
s
a
national
club
but
we
host
just
one
part
of
it
You
might
have
an
ACM
at
Berkeley
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
my
first
time
,
they
invited
me
and
told
me
they
would
tell
me
if
I
got
in
there
and
my
dad
dropped
me
off
and
went
to
work
thinking
it
was
going
to
take
a
while
and
it
took
me
30
min
to
go
around
to
find
where
they
were
doing
the
thing
.
Then
I
called
him
and
he
was
kinda
mad
.
will
check
on
that
[sskarz]
Ahhh
your
dad
definitely
wasn
’
t
expecting
it
to
be
done
so
soon
haha
Are
you
thinking
of
joining
any
clubs
first
year
at
Berkeley
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
he
was
okay
imma
drop
you
off
at
the
parking
lot
,
just
done
get
kidnapped
and
tell
me
when
you
are
done
,
he
had
just
got
to
work
.
I
havent
found
any
yet
,
but
maybe
campus
ambassaors
(
the
ones
the
give
school
tours
)
or
residential
hall
assistants
.
Other
than
that
I
will
probably
see
what
clubs
they
have
at
orientation
.
[sskarz]
You
definitely
should
!
It
’
s
really
easy
to
meet
new
people
and
make
some
friends
in
your
major
circle
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
That
’
s
how
I
met
some
of
my
buddies
over
here
lol
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
do
you
have
high
school
friends
at
csula
?
[sskarz]
Ah
I
would
say
no
but
Now
I
do
lol
[prabipyakurel]
oh
nice
nice
,
yea
I
have
a
lot
,
when
I
come
to
LA
I
will
be
visiting
there
often
,
hopefully
,
and
maybe
I
will
run
into
you
.
👍
[sskarz]
One
of
my
closest
friends
just
graduated
from
Keppel
and
he
’
s
coming
to
my
campus
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
thats
good
[sskarz]
Oh
definitely
let
me
know
when
you
’
re
here
and
we
can
meet
up
👍
❤
️
One
of
the
best
things
about
college
Is
having
that
fresh
start
mentality
Maybe
that
’
s
why
I
like
college
more
tbh
you
ever
have
those
peers
in
highschool
you
really
didn
’
t
like
being
around
But
was
forced
to
since
it
’
s
a
high
school
?
✅
It
’
s
like
that
never
exists
in
college
and
it
’
s
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
very
specific
ones
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
Same
here
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
there
was
this
one
girl
...
so
in
english
we
would
have
like
seminar
about
a
book
,
and
we
would
sit
in
a
big
circle
and
talk
and
ask
questions
,
but
our
teacher
always
told
us
if
we
shared
like
twice
to
step
out
and
give
others
a
chance
.
But
this
one
girl
would
like
answer
the
question
and
would
take
30
minutes
.
Dude
and
she
was
in
my
AP
lit
and
AP
lang
class
,
I
would
like
hate
her
,
I
got
an
F
because
I
didn
'
t
get
a
chance
to
speak
.
I
was
like
donw
with
her
,
I
wanted
to
seriously
go
up
to
her
and
be
like
"
shut
up
dammit
"
i
fr
wanted
to
to
do
this
😂
[sskarz]
Wtf
that
’
s
insane
As
a
teacher
how
do
you
not
stop
that
That
’
s
basically
talking
for
more
than
twice
length
😭
[prabipyakurel]
the
teacher
did
,
thats
the
wierd
part
like
she
would
go
on
and
on
,
and
it
doesnt
even
become
relevant
,
its
like
she
is
giving
a
summary
of
the
book
.
So
yea
I
understand
when
you
say
we
were
forced
to
be
around
people
in
high
school
.
[sskarz]
The
way
I
would
’
ve
started
coughing
increasingly
louder
as
she
would
continue
on
the
seminar
Just
to
piss
her
off
lol
I
mean
how
is
that
fair
[prabipyakurel]
yea
people
were
doing
that
,
there
were
peolpe
making
like
eye
contacts
to
each
other
and
rolling
their
eyes
dude
my
friend
donny
was
sitting
next
to
me
and
he
just
would
not
stop
laughing
,
he
was
like
"
well
at
least
we
dont
have
to
speak
"
i
wanted
to
give
up
on
life
at
that
moment
[sskarz]
My
brother
in
Christ
my
grade
depends
on
this
😭
[prabipyakurel]
ik
omg
i
was
explaining
how
this
will
negatively
impact
out
grades
it
was
our
god
damn
finals
speak
twice
to
get
full
points
and
ask
a
question
[sskarz]
WTF
OH
NAH
I
would
NEVER
let
her
speak
for
that
long
😤
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
after
she
was
done
someone
immediately
jumped
in
and
started
talking

She

spending
more
than
I

unexpectedly
[prabipyakurel]
Wow

Yes

I

lol
I
was
at
a
birthday
party
.
[sskarz]
oh

!
yeah
when
I
woke
up
,
I
checked
the
time
and
my
heart
just
dropped
😅
😂
I
hadn
'
t
had
lunch
or
dinner
so
I
just
went
and
had
a
meal
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh

at
least
you
got
you
sleep
tho
.
[sskarz]
yeah
,
desparately
needed
it
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
will
be
up
for
the
night
now
[sskarz]
yeah
...
that
'
s
a
problem
[prabipyakurel]
Was
it
difficult
to
put
that
thing
together
?
Like
from
a
scale
of
1
-
10
for
you
[sskarz]
the
thing
was
,
the
build
itself
wasn
'
t
that
difficult
it
was
the
fact
that
i
had
made
one
crucial
hindsight
that
caused
the
entire
thing
to
take
way
longer
than
it
should
'
ve
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
wow
,
yea
those
wires
were
probably
a
headache
huh
[sskarz]
oh
my
those
wires
give
me
nightmares

NanaseDizzy

[prabipyakurel]
Day

mares
😅
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
basically
i
mean
,
do
you
want
to
know
what
went
so
awry
?
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry
it
just
clicked
and
I
was
like
technically
he
sleep
during
the
day
?
Explain
in
non
technical
terms
[sskarz]
🤣
its
not
that
technical
💀
so
basically
I
forgot
...
my
screwdriver
kit
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
forgot
the
tools
to
build
🪦
rip
🤣
[sskarz]
I
prepared
for
like
weeks
and
I
forgot
the
ONE
THING
you
need
to
actually
put
the
thing
together
💀
😂
my
god
the
amount
of
stupidity
I
felt
was
incredible
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
but
it
’
s
okay
,
it
was
your
first
time
Good
job
on
that
[sskarz]
that
'
s
the
thing
...
it
'
s
not
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
worry
I
feel
that
completing
my
daily
tasks
😭
[sskarz]
i
have
no
idea
how
i
forgot
to
bring
them
relatable
so
like
forgetting
my
screwdriving
kit
it
took
us
an
extra
5
HOURS
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
did
you
not
have
it
at
home
?
[sskarz]
just
to
do
that
,
because
I
was
chasing
wild
geese
to
put
it
short
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
…
[sskarz]
you
do
not
want
to
see
the
organization
for
our
metal
tools
💀
😂
in
the
end
,
we
went
to
best
buy
and
bought
a
kit
,
only
for
my
dad
to
call
me
later
that
night
to
tell
me
where
it
actually
was
and
the
thing
was
,
you
might
be
thinking
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
actually
hilarious
[sskarz]
"
oh
so
stupid
why
didn
'
t
you
call
him
sooner
"
[prabipyakurel]
Let
me
guess
U
forgot
💀
[sskarz]
it
was
like
midnight
at
Greece
for
them
,
so
I
didn
'
t
want
to
call
them
during
the
middle
of
the
night
honestly
not
too
far
off
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
it
happens
So
are
you
just
up
right
now
,

don
’
t
feel
sleepy
or
anything
So
at
the
birthday
party
these
2
kids
took
frosting
and
put
it
on
each
other
and
it
was
the
cutest
thing
It
was
quite
messy
tho
[sskarz]
unfortunately
no
,
so
I
think
this
might
be
the
time
to
take
sleeping
pills
awwwwwww
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
try
closing
them
eyes
[sskarz]

,
I

red
velvet
and

[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
u
ever

like
red
velvet
is
just
chocolate
but
red
but
it
tastes
better
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
what
I
am
saying
But
when
I
say
that
to
anyone
else
,
they
be
like
I
don
’
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
Read
my
mind
[sskarz]
bro
they
are
the
ones
that
are
tripping
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

velvet
clearly

[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[sskarz]

so
invigorated
but
that
'
s
not
a
good
thing
:/
FR
ME
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
i
thought
this
was
funny
to
keep
in
mind
Why
do
you
not
feel
well
or
is
it
because
you
have
too
much
energy
and
don
’
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
[sskarz]
yeah
,
like
at
this
time
normally
i
would
usually
be
woozy
and
be
in
bed
👍
but
rn
,
i
could
legitamtely
go
workout
for
a
good
3
hours
type
of
energy
[prabipyakurel]
Not
a
bad
idea
Jk
jk
[sskarz]
the
gym
is
closed
😭
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
just
run
up
and
down
the
stairs
Until
u
drop
[sskarz]
i
mean
true
,
but
my
doggo
is
downstairs
and
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
so
i
don
'
t
want
to
disturb
him
might
have
to
just
do
some
pushups
or
something
,
cuz
its
looking
like
i
might
need
to
take
some
nyquill
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
then
yes
don
’
t
disturb
him
Why
don
’
t
you
drink
something
warm
like
tea
Maybe
that
will
make
you
fall
asleep
I
would
day
coffee
but
it
does
the
opposite
[sskarz]
not
a
bad
idea
👍
yeah
😅
aren
'
t
you
sleepy
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
,
took
an
extra
long
nap
during
the
day
and
after
the
eating
and
watching
people
dance
,
I
am
still
awake
:
[sskarz]
oh
dang
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
You
know
that
thing
you
were
putting
together
,
yea
I
thought
the
colorful
thing
was
really
cool
Sorry
don
’
t
know
the
name
of
it
[sskarz]
ohhhh
you
mean
the
LEDs
?
yeah
they
'
re
super
cool
and
controllable
too
i
was
thinking
of
putting
a
small
funko
pop
inside
the
PC
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yea
the
monitor
case
I
think
[sskarz]
but
idk
what
to
put
in
it
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
[sskarz]
any
ideas
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
create
a
Sanskar
bobble
head
and
put
it
in
there
[sskarz]
oof
that
sounds
way
too
self
centered
haha
i
was
thinking
more
like
superhero
vibes
or
villain
[prabipyakurel]
Mmm
maybe
you
can
put
loki
,
thors
brother
I
don
’
t
watch
marvel
but
he
is
really
cute
[sskarz]
oooooh
and
then
do
like
all
green
for
the
LEDs
to
match
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yea
Is
it
a
one
time
thing
or
can
you
change
it
over
and
over
again
?
[sskarz]
i
can
change
it
whenever
i
want
no
payment
required
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
then
go
for
it
[sskarz]
this
one
looks
cool
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
that
I
so
cute
I
love
his
character
[sskarz]
do
you
not
like
marvel
out
of
curiosity
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
just
always
watched
dc
Probably
why
,
but
I
have
watched
Spider
-
Man
Because
lol
he
is
cute
💯
[sskarz]
oh
have
you
watched
the
new
batman
movie
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
[sskarz]

i
guess
not
so
new
since
it
came
out
like
last
year
really
?
its
a
banger
of
a
movie
if
you
like
batman
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
o
don
’
t
really
watch
superhero
movies
,
I
think
I
have
only
watched
Thor
,
and
aqua
man
Yea
other
than
that
the
flash
series
,
green
arrow
series
,
supergirl
series
Yea
those
are
it
[sskarz]
ohhh
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
have
a
really
funny
story
If
you
are
there
in
that
situation
you
probably
would
have
slapped
me
😆
So
…
[sskarz]
oh
now
im
intrigued
haha
[prabipyakurel]
In
like
the
5th
grade
,
we
had
brought
snacks
since
it
was
the
last
week
of
school
and
back
then
I
didn
’
t
now
like
dc
or
marvel
other
than
Superman
.
And
my
teacher
had
put
on
the
justice
league
,
and
I
was
sitting
with
3
boys
(
all
nerds
that
were
into
that
thing
)
and
there
was
this
thing
about
aqua
man
and
he
came
out
of
the
the
water
,
and
I
turned
around
to
my
table
and
asked
“
is
that
thanos
?”.
Food
was
thrown
and
words
were
said
.
😭
[sskarz]
LMAO
AINT
NO
WAYYYYYYYY
Omg
that
means
you
’
ve
never
watched
infinity
war
or
endgame
from
marvel
:
O
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
and
my
friend
Donny
that
i
was
talking
about
he
stopped
eating
put
down
everything
and
slammed
the
table
and
said
,
“
prabi
,
thanks
is
bald
and
purple
,
aqua
man
had
long
hair
and
tattoos
”
and
I
was
still
confused
My
brother
put
those
on
and
I
was
supposed
to
watch
it
and
I
fell
asleep
💀
😂
[sskarz]
LOLOLOLOLOL
I
can
’
t
believe
that
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
I
watched
when
they
ran
together
and
I
was
out
the
next
second
[sskarz]
like
when
they
came
out
of
the
portals
to
fight
together
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
was
probably
it
Life
happens
[sskarz]
You
’
re
probably
the
first
person
I
have
ever
known
to
sleep
during
that
part
💀
Yeah
if
it
’
s
not
your
cup
of
tea
it
is
what
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
Me
too
,
I
am
just
built
like
that
Now
horror
movies
,
I
got
my
eyes
wide
open
for
them
I
wouldn
’
t
miss
a
scene
[sskarz]
Ahhh
I
see
I
see
Speaking
of
horror
movies
I
saw
that
a
new
paranormal
activity
is
coming
out
soon
[prabipyakurel]
👀
[sskarz]
have
you
watched
those
movies
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
[sskarz]
Ah
so
the
general
premise
is
basically
haunted
structures
,
but
you
view
the
story
through
like
video
cameras
[prabipyakurel]
Oooo
video
cameras
are
sooo
fun
[sskarz]
It
’
s
pretty
cool
and
it
scared
me
hard
when
I
was
a
little
kid
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
sooo
interesting
Yea
I
mean
when
we
were
little
ghosts
were
the
things
our
parents
told
us
to
scare
us
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
There
are
scenes
in
those
movies
where
it
’
ll
just
be
a
still
shot
of
a
hallway
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Taken
by
a
video
camera
For
like
30
seconds
straight
And
something
very
very
*
subtle
*
happens
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
the
build
up
sometimes
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
creepy
[prabipyakurel]
Relatable
and
you
have
to
like
squint
to
find
it
[sskarz]
Yeahhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
watched
the
Netflix
documentary
on
the
Cecil
hotel
You
would
like
it
[sskarz]
Oh
no
I
haven
’
t
[prabipyakurel]
Look
it
up
Really
interesting
[sskarz]
hold
on
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
its
taking
a
while
because
i
have
to
sign
into
netflix
and
i
forgot
the
password
💀
so
give
me
a
moment
👍
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
ok
[sskarz]
is
it
this
one
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yes
[sskarz]
ok
imma
put
this
on
my
watchlist
,
actually
sounds
really
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
based
on
true
story
[sskarz]
the
best
kind
of
stories
also
i
just
love
documentaries
in
general
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
there
are
crazy
thing
happening
around
the
world
Yea
documentaries
are
interesting
[sskarz]
ok
so
this
might
be
a
dumb
question
but
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
?
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
no
,
well
I
feel
like
people
that
have
gone
away
show
signs
but
not
in
like
a
👻
way
.
Do
you
?
[sskarz]
like
I
choose
not
to
believe
it
[prabipyakurel]
Not
the
way
it
shows
on
horror
movies
at
least
[sskarz]
yeah
I
have
had
my
handful
of
cases
of
"
ghost
"
like
encounters
[prabipyakurel]
But
does
it
ever
scare
you
to
walk
downstairs
after
everyone
is
asleep
or
be
able
in
the
house
.
[sskarz]
but
I
just
gaslight
myself
into
thinking
it
was
by
some
physical
causae
nah
not
really
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
really
?
[sskarz]
yeah
,
super
weird
cases
[prabipyakurel]
Like
recently
or
like
a
while
back
[sskarz]
actually
funny
story
well
not
so
funny
for
me
because
it
was
really
really
weird
and
kind
of
creepy
so
yesterday
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
it
’
s
okay
[sskarz]
back
when
my
friends
and
i
were
working
on
the
computer
we
brought
the
computer
back
upstairs
to
work
on
it
,
and
thats
when
it
all
booted
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
so
imagine
this
,
it
was
like
around
2
am
and
we
were
so
tired
,
they
were
going
to
go
drive
back
home
and
i
had
to
clean
downstairs
.
When
we
all
started
creeping
downstairs
silently
(
because
we
didn
'
t
want
to
disturb
my
sister
or
make
any
noise
),
we
heard
a
noise
and
we
all
stopped
dead
in
our
tracks
on
the
stairs
down
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
feeling
💀
[sskarz]
and
it
came
from
the
kitchen
,
so
i
thought
someone
had
come
into
our
house
or
break
in
or
something
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Probably
pulled
out
your
dog
huh
[sskarz]
so
i
had
to
go
tip
toe
my
way
to
the
living
room
which
connected
to
the
kitchen
in
the
same
room
and
all
of
a
sudden
,
i
hear
a
bhajan
playing
just
out
of
nowhere
it
starts
up
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
turn
back
and
i
see
my
friends
behind
me
like
super
confused
mind
you
its
completely
dark
down
here
and
apparently
for
literally
0
reason
my
Alexa
got
started
by
something
,
and
started
playing
a
bhajan
now
you
might
be
thinking
"
that
'
s
probably
a
scheduled
event
"
[prabipyakurel]
Lmao
😂
[sskarz]
like
on
the
alexa
which
NO
who
the
hell
is
going
to
do
puja
in
the
middle
of
the
night
[prabipyakurel]
The
ghosts
Jk
jk
[sskarz]
and
i
checked
in
the
app
,
no
where
there
did
it
say
to
start
playing
a
bhajan
[prabipyakurel]
…
[sskarz]
my
friends
just
started
saying
like
,
"
oh
nah
god
playing
with
us
"
and
so
they
quickly
left
,
i
turned
on
the
lights
,
and
nothing
had
changed
in
the
room
just
super
super
weird
and
creepy
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
lol
a
bhajan
tho
[sskarz]
im
dead
asf
💀
yeah
super
weird
[prabipyakurel]
Your
friend
were
probably
freaking
out
[sskarz]
they
started
creeped
out
[prabipyakurel]
Why
didn
’
t
you
turn
on
the
lights
on
your
way
down
[sskarz]
but
then
we
all
started
laughing
because
we
thought
someone
broke
in
and
needed
to
check
*
stealthily
*
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
just
made
scary
noises
and
scared
people
even
more
That
’
s
fun
[sskarz]
you
are
my
worst
nightmare
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
I
see
[sskarz]
the
way
i
would
'
ve
just
fell
down
the
stairs
if
i
heard
like
a
*
whisper
*
in
my
ear
😂

that
to
my
brother
,
when
we

downstairs
alone
I

him
or

up
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
I
have
been
dying
to
scare
someone
for
good
for
a
long
time
[sskarz]

of
,
we

and
chews
the
heart
of
the
mango
works
everytime
[prabipyakurel]

take
the
heart
of
the
mango
and
eat
it
over
the
sink
[sskarz]

good
to

[prabipyakurel]
i
just
cut
both
the
sides

Oh

Hahaha
His
paintings

[sskarz]
hahaaaaaaaaaaaaa
*
looks
at
my
computer
*

**
essentials
**
[prabipyakurel]

of
furniture
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

?
Yup

here
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
i
love
to
put
things
together
i
just
need
instructions
that
are
clear
of
course
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
sometimes
I
forget
to
read
the
manual
and
then
it
comes
out
all
wrong
💀
but
the
satisfaction
of
building
it
correctly
without
the
manual
is
too
great
so
I
like
to
try
*
and
eventually
fail
*
[prabipyakurel]
oh
that
has
happened
sooo
much
🤣
i
have
disassembled
so
many
things
nah
you
good
,
you
are
fine
,
you
built
an
entire
computer
so
[sskarz]
Hey
have
you
watched
the
show
How
to
Get
Away
with
Murder
on
Netflix
?
[prabipyakurel]
NO
oh
wow
,
i
searched
it
up
,
it
sounds
really
good
tho
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
a
thriller
murder
mystery
So
like
every
episode
there
’
s
a
new
case
for
murder
,
and
these
lawyers
have
to
basically
try
and
deduct
who
was
the
murderer
in
that
episode
My
cousin
introduced
me
to
it
,
and
it
sounded
like
something
you
may
be
interested
in
[prabipyakurel]
i
will
definelty
check
it
out
thanks
[sskarz]
Yeah
np
I
haven
’
t
watched
it
either
so
I
’
m
gonna
start
it
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

will
start
when
I
am
done
with
the
pakistani
show
I
started
yesterday
[sskarz]
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
um
random
question
:
what
are
your
thoughts
on
spiders
?
[sskarz]
I
like
to
put
them
down
the
sink
drain
😅
[prabipyakurel]
but
are
you
like
scared
of
them
[sskarz]
Not
really
[prabipyakurel]
I
freak
out
,
like
even
a
picture
is
enough
[sskarz]
I
just
squish
them
if
they
’
re
in
my
house
[prabipyakurel]
arghhhhh
i
run
and
find
someone
[sskarz]
Hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
A
pretty
good
method
of
killing
them
is
also
just
grabbing
the
vaccuum
And
just
suck
them
up
Works
like
a
charm
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
no
,
if
there
is
a
spider
in
my
house
,
I
am
not
getting
anything
,
I
will
simply
just
move
out
of
the
house
💀
[sskarz]
Have
you
seen
the
adorable
spider
?
[prabipyakurel]
...
no
[sskarz]
would
you
like
to
see
it
?
It
’
s
not
real
it
’
s
just
an
animation
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
am
good
[sskarz]
Hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
is
is
like
cartoon
[sskarz]
Yeah
basically
[prabipyakurel]
nah
i
searched
it
up
and
it
was
just
zoomed
in
spider
pics
[sskarz]
see
it
’
s
the
adorable
spider
I
’
ll
delete
it
in
case
you
still
hate
it
💀
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
no
,
please
dont
show
those
pics
again
[sskarz]
Gotcha
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
like
i
closed
the
discord
app
and
had
to
open
it
again
[sskarz]
😂
I
’
m
sorry
I
’
m
sorry
it
was
just
too
good
to
pass
up
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
its
okay
,
yea
when
i
ask
anyone
this
question
I
tell
them
in
advance
to
stay
away
from
pics
like
any
other
bug
is
fine
but
spider
,
noooooooooooo
And
for
the
record
,
that
thing
was
not
ADORABLE
it
was
hidious
[sskarz]
💀
fair
fair
it
’
s
name
was
Lucas
😂
It
was
actually
a
scientific
experiment
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont
care
what
its
name
was
,
lol
spider
is
still
spider
[sskarz]
it
was
supposedly
made
to
cure
Arachnaphovia
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
am
pretty
sure
i
have
that
and
that
experiment
clearly
failed
[sskarz]
now
that
you
’
ve
seen
it
I
’
m
guessing
it
doesn
’
t
work
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
don
’
t
worry
,
I
will
not
show
you
another
one
I
promise
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
is
there
any
bug
you
are
scared
of
?
[sskarz]
Hmmmmm
I
mean
if
it
’
s
not
squishable
,
then
yeah
Ok
like
,
crickets
I
’
m
not
scared
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
those
are
like
weird
you
just
use
a
broom
and
lead
them
out
[sskarz]
But
they
make
me
jump
if
they
try
to
jump
away
from
me
when
I
try
to
kill
them
And
it
’
s
annoying
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
that
feeling
is
pretty
annoying
[sskarz]
but
other
than
that
…
I
can
’
t
really
think
of
any
If
squishable
,
then
it
’
s
all
good
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
i
wish
i
could
squish
a
bug
or
kill
it
i
dont
even
have
that
in
me
[sskarz]
takes
some
courage
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
but
what
are
you
doing
at
the
moment
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
still
at
my
cousins
house
My
cousin
just
made
me
have
this
dish
where
it
’
s
like
mango
drenched
in
something
spicy
My
stomach
is
burning
so
hard
It
was
so
spicy
[prabipyakurel]
this
thing
=
[sskarz]
No
no
no
Lemme
take
a
picture
of
it
This
Idk
what
it
’
s
called
But
my
god
my
mouth
was
burning
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
that
is
just
aachar
it
looks
so
good
i
think
its
meant
to
be
spicy
[sskarz]
It
was
way
more
spicy
than
typical
aachar
trust
me
I
know
but
like
this
was
a
different
beast
💀
I
have
a
pretty
decent
spice
tolerance
and
this
almost
killed
me
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
i
love
trying
deadly
spicy
things
[sskarz]
I
think
they
may
have
screwed
up
the
ratio
with
sweet
and
spicy
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
maybe
maybe
[sskarz]
Oh
couldn
’
t
be
me
💀
[prabipyakurel]
congrats
!
you
'
re
not
dead
yet
[sskarz]
I
tried
the
ghost
pepper
chip
challenge
thing
and
that
scarred
me
It
was
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
that
I
would
not
do
,
I
need
spice
with
flavour
,
not
just
spice
[sskarz]
It
tasted
terrible
Yeah
same
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
and
why
did
you
do
that
,
was
it
with
friends
or
you
just
woke
up
and
was
like
,
let
me
do
this
?
[sskarz]
It
was
with
friends
yeah
I
lost
a
bet
Back
in
high
school
And
I
didn
’
t
have
milk
either
so
I
literally
felt
like
I
was
burning
from
inside
out
for
the
entire
day
and
the
next
day
I
felt
like
garbage
lol
would
not
recommend
unless
you
have
milk
or
ice
cream
on
standby
[prabipyakurel]
damn
cant
even
imagine
yea
I
wont
do
those
things
,
there
ia
a
difference
between
enjoying
spicy
food
and
doing
a
challenge
[sskarz]
yeah
it
’
s
best
to
stay
away
from
those
things
Now
something
really
spicy
I
enjoy
is
a
good
howlin
rays
sandwich
👍
[prabipyakurel]
but
that
aachar
seriously
looked
bomb
[sskarz]
it
’
s
deadly
💀
👍
[prabipyakurel]
What
is
your
favorite
kind
of
chips
?
[sskarz]
Either
Funyuns
or
hot
Cheetos
I
go
back
and
forth
depending
on
the
mood
wbu
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
those
are
amazing
,
i
personally
love
Cheetos
fries
but
second
is
hot
Cheetos
[sskarz]
Hot
Cheetos
fries
are
so
good
[prabipyakurel]
they
are
like
so
awesome
i
can
finish
an
entire
bag
in
one
sitting
[sskarz]
Saaaaaame
Put
a
good
show
on
and
that
thing
is
gone
by
the
first
episode
[prabipyakurel]
spicy
chips
are
way
better
than
normal
chips
yep
,
before
it
even
starts
[sskarz]
Yes
except
for
Funyuns
I
think
the
base
Funyuns
taste
better
than
the
spicy
variant
[prabipyakurel]
if
we
are
watching
a
movie
and
that
thing
is
in
front
of
me
,
it
will
be
done
by
the
time
we
choose
something
to
watch
🤣
debatable
based
on
the
mood
have
you
ever
tried
street
elote
?
[sskarz]
YEAAAAA
elote
is
BOMB
love
getting
it
from
the
street
vendors
[prabipyakurel]
yea
in
high
school
,
this
one
dude
used
to
sell
those
and
a
bunchhhh
of
chips
and
they
were
like
awesome
[sskarz]
there
’
s
quite
a
few
people
close
by
the
10
freeway
exits
that
have
them
and
sometimes
I
like
to
stop
by
and
get
one
[prabipyakurel]
his
name
was
juan
and
he
would
always
be
there
[sskarz]
Oh
awesomeeee
[prabipyakurel]
yea
they
are
like
kind
of
everywhere
[sskarz]
just
too
good
Makes
a
bit
of
a
mess
but
it
’
s
worth
it
[prabipyakurel]
sooo
worth
it
,
who
cares
about
the
mess
🔥
do
you
like
it
in
a
cup
or
on
a
stick
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
more
fun
on
a
stick
imo
easier
to
eat
too
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
when
we
go
out
with
mom
I
usually
get
the
cup
but
at
school
I
would
alternate
now
i
cant
stop
thinking
about
spicy
foods
maybe
gonna
make
myself
spicy
pani
puri
tomorrow
[sskarz]
Oh
hell
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
you
like
pani
puri
too
?
[sskarz]
I
can
’
t
think
of
more
food
or

a
while

Now

[sskarz]

be
this
local
place
called
Lampost
,
but
then
they
stopped
serving
a
special
food
saddens
me
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
never

that
place
,
but
pizza
is
good
from
a
lot
of
places
to
be
honest
[sskarz]

to
be
the
king

large
pizzas

tasted
crazy
good
Dominos

is
too
good
to
pass
up
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
Costco

good
as
well
,
cheap
too
[prabipyakurel]
yea
big
too
have
you
been
to
blaze
?
or
pizza
studio
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
it
’
s
been
a
while
since
I
’
ve
been
to
blaze
The
last
time
I
went
was
Pi
day
For
the
$
3
.
14
pizza
The
line
was
not
worth
it
tho
,
it
took
so
long
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
blaze
is
small
but
tasty
true
true
[sskarz]
The
pizza
itself
was
really
good
Just
standing
in
that
line
for
close
to
an
hour
was
not
ideal
lol
And
it
was
raining
that
day
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
that
part
sucks
rain
is
fun
,
its
fun
to
go
out
in
the
rain
i
got
scolded
by
my
teacher
back
in
may
for
opening
her
door
and
going
into
the
rain
when
there
was
lightning
too
.
you
ever
try
that
?
[sskarz]
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yes
if
and
only
if
I
literally
have
no
responsibilities
or
anything
That
actually
reminds
me
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
i
guess
[sskarz]
Back
in
Rome
,
my
sister
and
I
were
eating
at
a
restaurant
,
and
soon
after
we
finished
,
a
thunderstorm
started
[prabipyakurel]
oof
,
did
you
go
out
?
[sskarz]
And
there
were
no
taxis
available
or
in
sight
,
they
all
wanted
to
avoid
the
storm
[prabipyakurel]
bruh
[sskarz]
So
we
had
to
run
and
walk
like
3
miles
back
in
the
heavy
rain
It
was
so
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
thats
when
they
would
make
the
most
money
,
dumb
taxi
drivers
[sskarz]
and
it
was
during
a
time
that
my
eyes
were
still
extremely
sensitive
to
water
Since
I
had
my
surgery
a
week
prior
So
my
eyes
were
burning
the
entire
run
back
to
the
hotel
One
of
the
worst
travel
memories
ever
so
like
in
those
cases
,
oh
I
can
’
t
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
that
would
suck
[sskarz]
But
if
it
was
back
home
and
I
was
feeling
it
,
then
yeah
why
not
it
’
s
fun
to
get
wet
[prabipyakurel]
that
must
have
been
scary
[sskarz]
it
just
hurt
a
lot
lol
You
like
dancing
in
the
rain
or
just
like
jumping
in
puddles
?
[prabipyakurel]
sorry
that
must
have
been
kinda
painful
[sskarz]
No
need
to
be
sorry
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
no
i
like
literally
just
running
and
jumping
in
the
rain
not
just
puddles
like
I
am
willing
to
stay
drenched
for
the
entire
day
[sskarz]
Ah
I
get
you
I
’
m
more
of
a
,
sit
by
the
fireplace
with
a
good
book
and
hot
chocolate
with
lofi
music
in
the
background
while
a
storm
wavers
over
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
my
jam
👍
[prabipyakurel]
me
when
its
raining
😂
Yea
I
ask
my
friends
and
they
are
like
"
nooo
,
its
dirty
and
musty
"
but
it
feels
sooo
good
to
just
stand
in
the
rain
[sskarz]
It
is
fun
I
’
ll
give
you
that
👍
I
can
’
t
be
in
the
rain
for
too
long
tho
.
I
get
sick
easily
[prabipyakurel]
ahhh
yea
,
then
yea
you
shouldnt
be
out
in
the
rain
but
like
a
little
bit
is
okay
just
dont
sleep
out
there
you
know
[sskarz]
Sounds
like
a
good
plan
👍
[prabipyakurel]
that
seems
pretty
cozy
tho
,
with
hot
chocolate
too
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
You
have
any
books
you
’
re
reading
I
’
m
currently
reading
Game
of
Thrones
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
no
,
I
don
'
t
really
read
books
for
fun
,
I
don
'
t
really
like
reading
too
much
,
I
only
do
that
when
I
have
to
read
it
or
it
is
some
mystery
and
thriller
.
Not
too
much
of
a
book
worm
[sskarz]
Ah
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
,
sparknotes
got
me
through
my
entire
high
school
career
.
[sskarz]
That
’
s
facts
💯
👏
Spark
notes
saved
my
life
in
English
class
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Everytime
I
don
'
t
enjoy
reading
but
I
Loooooove
writing
.
Like
essays
or
anything
,
especially
on
pen
and
paper
is
like
I
can
do
.
[sskarz]
Have
you
tried
writing
novels
or
stories
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
not
novels
,
I
think
some
stories
I
have
written
for
like
small
assignment
or
competitions
,
but
most
were
like
biographies
and
information
based
.
I
wrote
one
on
stephen
Hawkings
for
a
essay
competition
,
I
lost
but
it
was
really
good
.
[sskarz]
ah
so
like
nonfiction
writing
gotcha
👍
That
’
s
really
cool
I
guess
we
’
re
opposites
in
that
regard
[prabipyakurel]
You
dont
like
writing
?
[sskarz]
No
I
do
,
I
used
to
write
small
novels
❤
️
Fiction
ones
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
thats
so
cool
,
you
still
have
access
to
them
[sskarz]
Probably
not
,
I
had
them
hosted
on
a
website
with
an
old
email
that
I
deprecated
I
doubt
I
could
still
access
them
I
’
m
a
big
fan
of
fiction
media
,
and
I
liked
writing
and
reading
them
too
not
so
much
nonfiction
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
thats
pretty
cool
,
well
if
you
have
any
,
i
would
love
to
read
them
.
completely
understand
[sskarz]
Now
that
you
’
ve
reminded
me
,
maybe
it
’
s
possible
but
it
’
s
a
long
shot
[prabipyakurel]
Ita
ok
,
only
if
you
can
access
them
.
[sskarz]
I
used
to
work
on
this
one
story
for
like
a
year
,
I
completed
near
100
pages
of
the
book
It
’
s
out
there
somewhere
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
am
sure
it
was
really
good
.
[sskarz]
not
published
but
somewhere
in
that
websites
database
Oh
probably
not
at
all
I
thought
it
was
a
masterpiece
as
a
kid
,
but
as
a
kid
you
don
’
t
really
know
what
good
writing
is
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
when
we
were
younger
our
minds
were
more
creative
,
and
you
as
a
kid
,
I
am
certain
that
the
piece
you
wrote
was
brilliant
.
[sskarz]
oh
it
was
nothing
like
that
incredible
haha
,
you
give
me
too
much
credit
it
was
just
like
one
of
those
curiosity
phases
i
try
and
explore
different
fields
all
the
time
and
that
'
s
when
i
did
that
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
yea
i
see
[sskarz]
even
if
the
writing
wasn
'
t
that
great
,
the
premise
was
pretty
cool
can
i
tell
you
a
little
about
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
yea
for
sure
you
never
have
to
ask
[sskarz]
well
had
to
make
sure
you
were
still
interested
lol
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
100
%
i
am
interested

[sskarz]
This
is
from
what
I
remember
from
some
years
ago
The
setting
was
a
mystical
place
where
people
could
harness
the
powers
of
the
planets
,
as
the
universe
revolved
around
their
world
,
their
lives
were
destined
to
revolve
space
and
the
universe
around
them
.
There
were
colonies
of
different
planets
like
Mercury
,
Earth
,
Saturn
,
etc
.
that
all
had
different
ideologies
about
how
the
world
functions
.
Many
of
the
conflicts
in
that
society
occurred
because
of
conflicting
ideas
between
colonies
,
and
would
result
in
turmoil
for
both
sides
.
So
,
an
order
was
formed
,
The
Planetary
Order
,
which
harnessed
the
power
of
the
Sun
,
and
there
were
only
5
individuals
that
could
wield
this
power
.
They
were
exceptional
,
right
from
birth
,
seen
as
gods
and
as
the
absolute
right
.
Anyone
that
dared
to
oppose
them
were
considered
outcasts
,
never
to
be
taken
seriously
,
and
always
viewed
as
a
threat
.
The
story
revolved
around
a
man
that
was
falsely
accused
(
this
was
not
known
yet
in
the
beginning
)
of
violating
the
Planetary
Order
(
basically
the
government
),
of
supposedly
murdering
a
family
from
the
Mars
Colony
.
This
man
was
completely
innocent
,
but
was
framed
by
someone
else
seeing
him
at
the
crime
scene
.
He
was
brought
upon
the
Planetary
Order
'
s
Court
,
and
deemed
sentence
to
death
to
eternity
.
It
seemed
that
this
man
'
s
fate
was
sealed
,
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
possibly
do
to
escape
from
the
chains
that
binded
him
to
the
Court
'
s
ground
.
As
the
guillotine
came
down
,
an
explosion
happened
,
the
court
was
attacked
by
a
mysterious
group
of
people
.
See
,
there
weren
'
t
just
the
planets
in
the
solar
system
that
could
give
powers
,
and
it
wasn
'
t
a
star
either
,
rather
the
space
that
fills
the
rest
of
the
distance
between
planets
and
stars
and
galaxies
.
The
Void
itself
,
which
was
infamous
for
denying
government
power
and
always
seeked
righteousness
in
the
free
will
.
The
man
is
then
taken
by
The
Void
,
and
together
with
that
group
of
people
,
he
seeks
to
take
revenge
upon
the
Planetory
Order
,
and
seek
the
man
that
framed
him
.
sorry
if
its
a
bit
long
,
this
is
just
the
synopsis
of
what
the
story
is
about
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
that
was
soooooo
good
,
that
was
like
interesting
from
the
beginnning
to
the
end
.
I
would
have
loved
to
read
this
if
it
was
a
story
.
❤
️
It
is
amazing
that
you
wrote
about
things
like
this
when
you
were
little
.
[sskarz]
awwww
thank
you
!!!
I
wish
I
still
had
the
story
files
,
I
was
super
passionate
about
that
for
like
a
year
[prabipyakurel]
Why
don
'
t
you
continue
the
story
now
?
[sskarz]
well
...
I
'
d
have
to
find
where
I
stored
all
that
writing
somewhere
or
start
from
scratch
[prabipyakurel]
Like
continue
from
how
you
remember
and
just
write
,
lets
the
words
flow
with
your
imagination
and
wisdom
.
[sskarz]
I
definitely
could
,
but
I
remember
hitting
a
lot
of
writing
blocks
I
always
suffered
with
that
inconsistency
of
creativity
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
but
the
fact
that
you
explained
the
summary
so
well
in
a
couple
of
minutes
was
amazing
.
I
would
read
that
book
if
this
was
the
summary
published
.

❤

[sskarz]
that
means
a
lot
to
me
,
thank
you
for
the
kind
words
😭
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
It
happens
,
but
you
are
like
a
pretty
strong
writer
,
you
can
go
places
with
this
story
.
Don
'
t
even
mention
it
,
it
was
written
in
a
very
nice
way
,
I
was
intrigued
by
it
from
the
beginning
.
[sskarz]
I
remember
having
a
lot
of
fun
writing
that
story
I
wanted
it
to
be
hundreds
of
pages
long
but
uh
,
yeah
its
somewhere
in
the
internet
now
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
all
the
power
and
court
and
rivalry
,
those
were
soo
interesting
,
but
wow
,
i
was
like
waiting
for
a
while
and
it
was
like
amazing
.
I
am
not
bluffing
,
like
seriously
.
[sskarz]
thank
you
!!!
[prabipyakurel]
Well
if
you
ever
find
it
,
be
sure
you
send
it
over
.
💯
[sskarz]
i
always
liked
the
idea
of
a
protaganist
against
the
world
kind
of
concept
you
'
re
the
first
person
I
'
d
show
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
those
books
are
always
interesting
.
[sskarz]
i
had
the
story
set
for
the
protaganist
to
be
filled
with
rage
during
the
beginning
of
the
story
,
but
slowly
change
his
mentality
as
he
gets
closer
and
closer
to
getting
revenge
against
his
framer
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
you
had
this
planned
out
huh
.
[sskarz]
from
being
petty
and
vengeful
,
to
being
the
bigger
person
and
not
continuing
the
cycle
yeah
I
had
writing
notes
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wanted
to
flesh
out
his
character
to
be
interesting
and
to
prove
that
people
can
change
👍
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
Got
the
mint
chocolate
chip
😋
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
,
that
looks
so
good
right
now
we
just
ran
out
of
ice
cream
yesterday
lol
Good
Afternoon
though
!
[sskarz]
NOOOO
rip
😭
good
afternoon
!
i
just
came
back
from
doing
a
bunch
of
work
and
having
lunch
so
im
chillin
now
wbu
[prabipyakurel]
Cleaning
room
and
figuring
out
what
I
need
to
take
and
what
I
can
leave
here
.
[sskarz]
when
are
you
leaving
for
Berkely
?
[prabipyakurel]
August
15th
[sskarz]
Oh
wow
so
you
only
have
a
month
and
some
days
left
it
must
be
so
nervewracking
to
get
closer
to
that
day
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
It
makes
me
sad
when
I
think
about
it
,
I
wan
'
t
to
leave
and
like
study
but
at
the
same
time
,
I
am
sad
to
leave
everything
behind
.
Like
just
the
thought
of
going
into
the
dorm
and
staying
with
roommates
and
not
seeing
family
everyday
is
really
depressing
,
and
I
just
try
not
to
think
about
it
yet
because
then
I
start
crying
.
😭
[sskarz]
awwww
I
'
m
not
sure
for
what
I
can
say
,
that
just
sounds
really
hard
to
deal
with
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
I
think
that
this
is
gods
plan
and
I
will
just
go
along
with
it
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Life
happens
for
its
reasons
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
and
I
will
be
back
for
the
summer
,
so
I
think
that
is
something
[sskarz]
it
comes
around
real
fast
just
like
highschool
those
days
went
by
really
really
quick
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
,
honestly
you
are
right
,
time
flies
by
fast
and
people
keep
telling
me
that
these
4
years
(
or
3
)
are
going
to
fly
by
really
fast
,
but
I
don
'
t
know
.
Maybe
once
I
start
getting
used
to
it
,
It
won
'
t
feel
as
sad
anymore
.
[sskarz]
new
adventure
,
new
friends
,
new
hobbies
,
it
all
comes
in
at
once
so
once
you
start
to
learn
how
to
juggle
all
that
❤
️
it
kind
of
just
goes
by
at

that
'
s
how
it
feels
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
for
sure
,
it
will
be
a
new
experience
for
sure
.
💯
Yea
looking
back
at
high
school
when
I
used
to
think
about
how
great
it
would
be
to
go
to
Berkeley
and
study
there
,
and
the
closer
it
gets
,
the
more
reality
hits
me
.
But
it
is
what
it
is
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
going
to
your
dream
uni
how
awesome
is
that
!
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
I
guess
so
.
Yea
there
are
certainly
positive
outlooks
on
this
experience
too
.
[sskarz]
you
will
certainly
see
them
once
you
start
your
uni
journey
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
thank
you
!
I
helps
talking
to
someone
about
it
honestly
.

'
m

helping
you
:)
❤

[prabipyakurel]
So
are
you
just
resting
now
?
[sskarz]
I
'
m
kinda
just
sitting
in
a
voice
call
with
some
of
my
buddies
,
and
they
'
re
playing
something
and
I
'
m
just
here
staring
at
my
monitor
so
resting
,
but
also
bored
,
but
also
idk
what
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
you
are
on
a
voice
call
,
i
hope
I
am
not
disturbing
lol
.
[sskarz]
in
no
shape
or
form
dw
about
it
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
pretty
boring
[sskarz]
i
was
trying
to
customize
my
desktop
screen
and
i
got
pretty
far
but
it
took
so
much
out
of
me
mentally
i
don
'
t
like
coding
when
im
not
in
the
mood
:/
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
in
the
bright
side
,
you
did
something
.
Yea
its
alright
,
sometimes
just
resting
and
thinking
about
nothing
helps
.
[sskarz]
i
actually
read
something
about
how
boredom
is
good
for
the
mind
it
was
like
a
whole
scientific
article
,
forgot
where
i
read
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
boredom
is
good
for
mind
?
lol
time
to
be
more
bored
than
[sskarz]
but
essentially
,
its
cleanses
your
mind
from
constantly
needing
to
satisfy
your
dopamine
receptors
in
your
head
[prabipyakurel]
Very
interesting
[sskarz]
and
with
the
coming
generation
and
times
,
attention
span
and
that
constant
feeding
of
dopamine
to
the
brain
is
causing
a
lot
of
issues
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
yea
the
upcoming
generation
is
going
to
be
a
lot
to
deal
with
[sskarz]
*
i
meant
our
generation
but
ya
essentially
that
too
💀*
[prabipyakurel]
OH
lol
[sskarz]
with
like
tiktok
and
shorter
form
content
being
fed
constantly
that
kind
of
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
thats
true
thats
true
yea
social
media
has
changed
a
lot
[sskarz]
yep
,
i
'
m
getting
pretty
exhausted
from
the
amount
of
social
media
outlets
and
just
general
necessity
of
it
on
iphone
there
is
this
like
screen
time
tracker
that
checks
how
long
you
use
your
phone
on
average
across
a
week
and
then
sends
a
report
,
so
I
'
ve
been
using
that
to
slowly
reduce
that
as
much
as
I
can
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
,
like
looking
back
at
when
we
were
little
and
how
we
werent
too
into
all
this
social
media
,
life
was
wayyy
more
peaceful
too
.
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
message
pops
up
at
the
end
of
every
week
and
sometimes
its
like
wow
[sskarz]
how
much
is
your
average
?
mine
used
to
be
around
6
hours
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
my
brother
is
playing
a
live
game
on
my
phone
i
will
tell
you
in
like
20
min
lol
sorry
[sskarz]
haha
no
worries
[prabipyakurel]
but
thats
not
too
bad
[sskarz]
good
luck
on
his
game
💯
👍
that
'
s
like
1
/
4
of
the
day
if
you
really
think
about
it
,
that
'
s
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
yea
but
I
am
sure
others
have
it
way
more
.
[sskarz]
true
true
i
'
ve
got
it
reduced
down
to
average
5
hours
an
hour
at
a
time
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
see
,
getting
better
and
better
I
think
its
because
we
have
gotten
so
used
to
having
our
phones
around
,
that
its
tempting
to
just
open
it
and
have
a
short
look
at
it
.
[sskarz]
yeahhhhhh
what
'
s
your
plan
for
the
rest
of
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
i
am
going
to
eat
maggi
again
today
,
and
make
pani
puri
later
near
dinner
time
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
the
pani
puri
sounds
bomb
ngl
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
It
will
taste
good
.
[sskarz]
it
can
'
t
be
that
hard
to
make
pani
puri
,
i
'
ve
never
tried
so
i
can
'
t
say
[prabipyakurel]
not
too
hard
,
its
just
I
never
get
the
amount
of
salt
right
and
I
usually
put
like
less
salt
in
every
food
i
make
.
You
have
never
made
pani
puri
?
[sskarz]
nope
[prabipyakurel]
lol
that
needs
to
be
on
your
bucket
list
it
is
really
fun
The
puri
is
like
remade
that
you
need
to
fry
,
and
the
make
the
potato
stuffing
and
mint
and
cilantro
flavoured
water
[sskarz]
ah
so
its
actually
pretty
easy
👍
i
juts
searched
up
a
recipe
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
got
a
lot
of
recipes
from
mamu
and
just
search
up
a
video
to
guide
me
through
it
but
you
can
do
it
[sskarz]
tru
,
will
have
to
give
it
a
try
sometime
👍
random
question
do
you
listen
to
any
podcasts
[prabipyakurel]
Um
not
really
,
the
only
time
I
listened
to
one
was
in
my
gov
class
I
dont
really
what
to
listen
to
[sskarz]
gov
class
?
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
?
ap
government
class
in
high
school
lol
[sskarz]
yeah
i
like
to
listen
to
a
couple
what
kind
of
podcast
was
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
um
some
presidential
one
I
dont
remember
[sskarz]
oh
probably
boring
[prabipyakurel]
ye
not
too
interesting
,
I
had
to
listen
to
it
and
fill
out
a
worksheet
.
[sskarz]
ughhhhhh
worksheets
high
school
memories
flood
back
💀
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
,
usually
I
love
writing
but
not
answering
questions
ffrom
videos
or
podcasts
What
do
you
usually
listen
to
?
[sskarz]
i
love
writing
if
its
not
tied
to
an
assignment
and
i
feel
forced
to
do
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
usually
just
a
group
of
people
talking
about
stuff
like
idk
how
to
categorize
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
[sskarz]
there
were
some
informational
ones
i
used
to
listen
to
one
of
them
was
like
this
psychological
podcast
that
explained
different
behaviors
and
disorders
every
episode
and
that
one
was
pretty
interesting
,
but
at
some
point
it
was
a
bit
much
[prabipyakurel]
That
seems
pretty
interesting
yea
psychology
is
kind
of
interesting
[sskarz]
i
enjoyed
that
subject
back
in
highschool
was
genuinely
interested
in
that
class
so
that
podcast
kinda
seemed
naturally
interesting
,
but
it
went
into
so
much
detail
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
had
planned
on
taking
that
in
high
school
but
I
had
7th
period
and
the
only
space
available
was
0
period
and
my
counselor
looked
at
me
and
went
,
"
you
really
want
8
classes
senior
year
",
and
then
i
let
it
go
.
💀
[sskarz]
oh
nah
💀
miss
me
with
8
classes
during
senior
year
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
i
had
it
picked
over
the
summer
and
dropped
it
last
second
[sskarz]
during
senior
year
,
i
had
like
5
classes
i
had
no
more
interest
at
that
point
to
take
more
classes
,
espeically
since
junior
and
sophomore
years
were
filled
with
AP
courses
senioritis
hit
hard
😭
[prabipyakurel]
yep
that
happened
to
a
lot
of
people
honeslty
senior
year
was
very
depressing
but
fun
I
dont
know
how
to
describe
it
,
but
the
close
we
got
to
finishing
it
got
weirder
and
weirder
[sskarz]
*
back
in
my
day
*...

basements
and
watch
shows
and
do
homework
lol
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow

avoiding
any
social
interaction
😂

times
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO

"

year
and
a
half
ago
maybe
11
"
now
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
you
are
pretty
tall
[sskarz]
yeah
the
tallest
in
my
family
i
think
i
got
it
from
my
great
grandfather
because
he
was
pretty
tall
[prabipyakurel]
must
be
special
Ahhhhhh
the
genes
[sskarz]
oh
nah
,
im
the
guy
that
takes
stuff
from
the
high
shelves
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
thats
my
brother
,
i
just
climb
on
the
kitchen
countertops
when
I
need
to
get
something
from
high
shelves
.
when
you
'
re
too
short
[sskarz]
who
needs
stools
when
you
have
the
human
stool
😂
[prabipyakurel]
literally
me
everyday
[sskarz]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
and
I
dont
know
if
I
have
ever
told
you
this
,
but
when
I
drive
I
move
my
seat
up
soo
close
to
the
front
that
if
I
get
out
and
not
move
the
seat
back
,
no
one
can
get
in
.
[sskarz]
omg
its
the
oppsite
for
me
i
have
to
lean
the
seat
usually
all
the
way
back
because
more
than
half
my
height
is
from
my
legs
and
then
whenever
my
parents
try
to
drive
my
car
,
they
have
to
move
it
back
up
and
its
always
just
a
constant
battle
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
thats
not
bad
,
If
i
move
up
the
accelerator
is
too
close
to
my
feet
and
if
I
move
back
I
can
'
t
reach
the
breaks
.
[sskarz]
the
goldilocks
of
car
chair
placement
haha
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
makes
me
so
mad
sometimes
😂
[sskarz]
if
my
parents
move
the
seat
up
,
im
like
crunched
up
in
the
seat
and
my
legs
hit
the
dashboard
💀
[prabipyakurel]
oof
Tall
man
driving
-
Tall
[sskarz]
literally
meeeeeeeeeeee
[prabipyakurel]
lol
the
person
behind
you
probably
wont
get
so
much
leg
space
huh
?
[sskarz]
i
try
to
give
as
much
as
I
can
usually
its
comfortable
for
them
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
i
see
[sskarz]
just
depends
on
the
car
im
driving
lol
[prabipyakurel]

Lol
last
time
I
went
to
the
doctors
they
told
me
I

5
feet
and
I
went
2
weeks
ago
and
the
nurse
was
like
,
height
=

[sskarz]

other
doctor

straight
lied

still
got
a
few
years
left
for
growth
[prabipyakurel]
according
to
my
brother
they
accidently
added
a
little
more
to
my
height
[sskarz]
Nah

dislike
being
short

you
wish
to
be
taller
[prabipyakurel]

I
am
fine
with
it
,
it
feels
okay
to
be
tiny
❤
️
before
people
would
be
kind
of
mean
and
I
used
to
wish
I
grew

little
more

I
want
to
do
something
It
’
s
canceling
out
[prabipyakurel]
lol
sometimes
its
dead
boring
ngl
[sskarz]
exactly
might
have
to
watch
that
Cecil
hotel
documentary
lol
[prabipyakurel]
omg
watch
it
you
know
that
hotel
is
located
in
downtown
LA

open
i
think
[sskarz]
Me
and
the
homies
about
to
go
ghost
hunting
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Would
be
a
cool
tourist
location
[prabipyakurel]
right
tourist
location
with
the
number
of
murders
and
deaths
there
,
I
dont
think
tourisy
attraction
is
the
right
name
If
you
know
richard
ramirez
,
the
killer
,
yea
he
used
to
stay
on
the
14th
floor
[sskarz]
Oh
Hmmm
yeah
that
’
s
true
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
go
check
it
out
but
personally
there
are
homeless
and
sketchy
people
in
that
area
and
I
would
probably
go
with
someone
Hey

you
'
ll
be
well
prepared

👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
now
leaving
is
the
hard
part
[sskarz]
you
remember
that
cousin
I
was
talking
about
yesterday
?
I
went
to
their
house
to
have
momo
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yea
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
basically
when
I
was
in
middle
school
,
he
actually
graduated
from
high
school
and
got
into
UCSD
[prabipyakurel]
OH
wow
,
san
diego
[sskarz]
I
remember
bawling
my
eyes
out
the
day
of
his
departure
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
how
old
were
you
?
[sskarz]
a
core
memory
just
unlocked
for
me
lol
I
was
like
around
11
or
12
I
'
d
say
somewhere
in
that
range
[prabipyakurel]
wow
okay
well
you
spent
so
much
time
around
him
,
it
probably
made
you
sad
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
it
was
horrible
but
it
was
good
too
finally
got
my
own
room
after
12
years
of
my
life
lol
[prabipyakurel]
you
were
like
waiting
for
that
to
happen
lol
[sskarz]
hahahaha
who
doesn
'
t
want
their
own
room
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
know
how
that
feels
[sskarz]
especially
as
a
kid
you
used
to
share
a
room
with
your
brother
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
I
remember
your
old
house
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
way
smaller
everything
was
smaller
,
now
when
we
go
there
it
still
feels
like
home
but
after
he
came
back
,
did
you
2
share
again
?
[sskarz]
oh
nah
by
the
time
he
came
back
,
we
moved
into
the
house
I
live
in
today
so
we
had
a
guest
room
he
stayed
in
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
where
did
you
guys
live
previously
?
I
see
[sskarz]
like
5
minutes
from
where
we
live
right
now
[prabipyakurel]
oh
thats
not
too
bad
[sskarz]
idk
what
those
houses
are
called
but
its
like
a
row
of
houses
behind
a
major
gate
well
it
was
an
apartment
i
think
im
not
sure
,
im
not
really
knowledgable
about
types
of
houses
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
it
was
like
a
condo
something
like
this
i
suppose
[sskarz]
yeah
its
something
like
that
actually
i
can
go
on
google
earth
and
show
you
exactly
what
it
looked
like
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
sure
sorry
for
being
nosey
lol
[sskarz]
no
way
you
'
re
not
nosy
at
all
im
the
one
that
is
trying
to
show
you
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
but
thanks
'
[sskarz]
im
like
struggling
to
find
this
house
hold
on
[prabipyakurel]
you
dont
have
like
the
address
[sskarz]
i
remember
the
address
,
but
like
it
just
drops
me
into
the
middle
of
an
intersection
for
some
reason
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
so
im
trying
to
find
my
way
there
as
if
i
would
drive
there
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
'
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh
im
just
dumb
i
got
my
address
wrong
😂
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[sskarz]
it
was
like
right
here
i
was
like
the
2nd
house
to
the
end
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
it
was
nice
,
i
remember
seeing
these
types
of
houses
[sskarz]
yeah
it
was
nice
tho
that
house
was
haunted
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
why
,
did
you
feel
someone
was
there
?
[sskarz]
had
a
lot
of
weird
interactions
with
like
random
door
openings
,
creaks
from
stairs
or
downstairs
when
no
one
is
home
,
ghost
steps
and
i
had
a
bunch
of
weird
dreams
there
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
nah
it
scared
the
crap
out
of
me
[prabipyakurel]
dreams
it
might
have
been
because
you
watched
or
thought
too
deeply
about
those
things
yea
i
understand
you
were
little
when
I
was
young
,
I
would
shut
off
the
lights
so
fast
and
run
to
sleep
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
confirmation
bias
was
probably
a
huge
contributor
to
those
experiences
lol
you
were
afraid
of
the
dark
?
[prabipyakurel]
for
sure
when
I
was
little
yea
[sskarz]
im
guessing
not
anymore
now
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
was
eating
pani
puri
and
dropped
it
all
over
myself
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhh
noooooo
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
,
now
I
can
come
downstairs
in
the
dark
and
look
for
suspicious
things
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
easily
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
have
you
ever
done
the
ouija
board
?
[prabipyakurel]
IT
'
S
TIME
TO
PLAY
ngl
always
wanted
to
try
u
?
I
never
believed
that
thing
was
real
[sskarz]
i
have
a
couple
times
there
was
this
wild
time
when
i
had
a
nepali
party
going
on
and
some
of
my
friends
wanted
to
play
the
game
so
we
made
the
game
on
like
a
piece
of
paper
[prabipyakurel]
on
paper
lol
[sskarz]
and
it
answered
a
lot
of
questions
yeah
i
think
so
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
this
was
a
long
time
ago
,
it
could
'
ve
been
something
else
but
I
'
m
pretty
sure
it
was
on
paper
💀
listen
listen
I
couldn
'
t
sleep
that
night
I
was
so
scared
haha
[prabipyakurel]
lol
was
it
recent
,
or
a
while
back
I
understand
if
you
were
little
[sskarz]
it
was
a
couple
years
back
like
when
I
was
15
or
16
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
did
you
have
like
nightmares
after
or
were
you
like
just
scared
?
[sskarz]
nah
I
was
just
scared
[prabipyakurel]
You
ever
tell
your
parents
you
were
scared
?
like
when
you
feel
scared
[sskarz]
nah
[prabipyakurel]
me
neither
[sskarz]
I
mean
my
parents
are
the
type
to
listen
to
that
,
and
then
just
start
laughing
which
I
totally
understand
now
but
as
a
kid
,
my
god
that
wouldn
'
t
have
made
anything
better
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
all
parents
do
that
they
be
like
"
there
is
nothing
there
,
oh
its
gonna
eat
you
,
its
gonna
take
you
away
"
Never
made
me
feel
more
assured
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
I
would
totally
do
that
as
a
parent
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
be
like
,
"
stop
being
a
kid
,
deal
with
it
"
it
makes
sense
the
more
you
grow
up
about
the
things
our
parents
told
us
when
we
were
little
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
i
used
to
think
so
differently
back
then
what
maturity
actually
does
is
wild
[prabipyakurel]
yea
right
but
we
need
to
play
the
ouija
board
together
sometime
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
im
downnnnnnnn
❤
️
and
in
the
dark
with
a
flashlight
to
the
chin
[prabipyakurel]
We
also
need
to
go
bungee
jumping
,
six
flags
,
skydiving
and
so
many
do
more
dangerous
things
.
[sskarz]
give
me
the
time
and
the
place
,
I
'
m
down
there
aren
'
t
many
people
that
are
willing
to
do
such
things
[prabipyakurel]
as
soon
as
i
get
some
time
a
peace
in
life
,
definitely
❤
️
which
is
why
I
am
so
glad
that
you
are
willing
[sskarz]
of
course
!
been
waiting
for
a
person
to
be
willing
to
try
these
things
out
:)
❤
️
you
just
let
me
know
when
you
'
re
ready
[prabipyakurel]
seriously
people
be
scared
when
you
mention
these
things
and
they
havent
even
tried
it
[sskarz]
frrrrrrrrrrr
i
have
a
friend
that
is
scared
of
Knotts
Berry
'
s
Farm
and
I
'
m
like
bruh
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
not
been
there
,
but
the
rides
dont
even
seem
scary
[sskarz]
they
'
re
a
total
push
over
[prabipyakurel]
they
look
like
the
beginner
version
of
six
flags
[sskarz]
they
are
fun
,
but
they
'
re
like
the
elementary
to
middle
school
levels
of
rides
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
[sskarz]
and
then
you
promote
to
six
flags
,
where
its
like
high
school
and
college
level
rides
and
voila
,
you
'
ve
graduated
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
how
you
explain
it
quite
interesting
[sskarz]
and
then
I
guess
masters
and
PHD
come
in
the
forms
of
bungee
jumping
and
sky
diving
ok
i
have
a
question
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
when
you
'
re
like
studying
50
terms
of
something
,
like
lets
say
political
terms
how
do
you
try
and
remember
those
50
terms
and
their
definition
what
method
do
you
use
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
take
a
line
sheet
of
paper
that
I
split
in
half
and
write
the
rod
on
one
side
and
definition
on
the
other
,
say
them
line
by
line
at
least
10
times
each
,
and
soon
start
covering
one
side
of
the
paper
and
see
if
I
can
say
definition
just
looking
at
the
word
and
vice
versa
.
HBU
?
[sskarz]
ohhhh
so
you
take
it
a
very
literal
way
of
memorization
that
'
s
cool
because
I
do
it
totally
differrent
[prabipyakurel]
You
Don
'
t
Even
Know
-
Saturday
Night
Live
how
do
you
think
i
passed
spanish
buddy
???
DO
you
use
flashcards
?
[sskarz]
cuz
u
just
a
genius
buddy
:)
So
I
try
and
associate
certain
terms
to
a
term
or
something
physical
I
'
m
very
familiar
with
[prabipyakurel]
ahhh
yes
i
have
been
told
to
try
that
,
never
tried
it
[sskarz]
so
like
lets
say
the
word
is
government
,
and
the
definition
is
blah
blah
blah
,
I
try
and
remember
government
and
relate
it
to
something
like
Planetary
Order
which
I
created
idk
helps
a
lot
to
remember
these
things
by
association
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
creative
mind
,
I
could
never
.
[sskarz]
I
used
to
do
quizlet
setups
tho
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
just
lock
myself
in
a
room
and
need
to
be
able
reading
it
over
and
over
again
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
do
that
anymore
,
it
would
drive
my
brain
to
boredom
[prabipyakurel]
quizlet
is
fun
,
thats
how
i
memorized
most
of
the
27
amendments
and
50
states
and
capital
[sskarz]
💀
so
like
this
one
time
back
in
my
middle
school
,
I
had
a
chemistry
class
and
he
never
gave
us
extra
credit
for
anything
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
on
the
final
week
,
he
said
if
you
can
memorize
the
entirety
of
the
periodic
table
in
order
and
give
me
the
symbols
in
2
days
,
he
would
give
just
a
few
points
more
on
our
final
so
for
the
next
2
days
,
i
sat
down
and
did
association
on
every
single
element
,
and
memorized
the
periodic
table
song
haha
[prabipyakurel]
dont
tell
me
you
memorized
the
table
[sskarz]
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
class
to
do
that
💀
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
compliment
by
the
way
[sskarz]
with
pride
😤
I
'
ve
never
understood
how
"
nerd
"
is
supposed
to
be
an
insult
I
'
m
quite
literally
the
ultimate
nerd
[prabipyakurel]
i
relate
to
that
since
middle
school
I
was
the
one
asian
that
didnt
look
asian
but
was
called
smart
I
felt
like
the
dumbest
person
,
all
i
did
was
my
work
[sskarz]
"
you
'
re
a
nerd
"
ok
but
like
I
will
always
be
smarter
than
you
so
like
.......
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
gotta
show
them
up
with
the
skills
of
a
hard
working
nerd
😤
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[sskarz]
when
I
was
a
kid
,
I
had
a
couple
guys
that
tried
to
bully
me
by
calling
me
names
and
stuff
,
but
I
'
d
always
fire
back
at
them
and
eventually
they
left
me
alone
after
middle
school
[prabipyakurel]
omg

had
smiliar
experience

to
get
my
dog
outside
and
take
care
of
him
went
back
for
a
nap
tho
,
feeling
pretty
good
👍

wow
,
is
that
when
he
needs
to
go
out
usually
?
[sskarz]
if
he
'
s
inside
yeah
,
usually
he
wakes
up
around
that
time
and
I
need
to
let
him
do
his
potty
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
,
you
take
care
of
your
dog
so
well
👍
My
neighbors
on
the
other
hand
leave
their
dogs
outside
even
thought
the
winter
and
they
like
bark
and
whine
all
night
.
[sskarz]
he
'
s
my
little
brother
so
ofc
lol
awwwww
[prabipyakurel]
thats
so
sweet
[sskarz]
sometimes
bear
does
bark
saying
he
wants
to
be
inside
,
but
I
only
bring
him
in
if
its
too
hot
/
cold
out
or
fireworks
otherwise
he
gets
spoiled
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
that
makes
sense
,
dogs
scare
me
but
it
makes
me
sad
when
i
see
people
mistreat
them
.
[sskarz]
yeah
they
deserve
the
best
of
the
best
❤
️
have
you
ever
wanted
a
pet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
when
I
was
younger
I
wanted
a
dog
because
I
was
fine
around
them
but
now
that
I
freak
out
near
them
.
If
i
were
to
get
a
pet
I
would
get
a
pomeranian
because
they
are
like
the
fluffiest
dogs
or
like
bunnies
.
In
nepal
,
my
dad
had
brought
me
like
5
bunnies
,
and
all
of
them
had
a
tragic
death
and
we
lost
them
quickly
.
[sskarz]
awwww
I
'
m
sorry
to
hear
that
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
was
like
4
,
but
i
remember
one
ran
away
,
the
other
fell
off
a
roof
,
and
the
rest
,
god
knows
where
they
went
[sskarz]
oh
wow
i
guess
they
'
re
relatively
hard
to
maintain
[prabipyakurel]
for
me
at
least
i
think
i
let
them
free
lol
it
was
probably
my
bad
[sskarz]
you
were
pretty
young
so
it
must
be
hard
to
remember
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
like
i
am
like
forgetting
so
many
important
things
randomly
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
remember
anything
before
being
5
years
old
,
its
like
i
gained
consciousness
at
that
age
😅
life
happens
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep
did
you
always
have
a
dog
or
did
you
have
a
different
pet
before
bear
?
[sskarz]
I
did
have
another
dog
before
bear
,
his
name
was
Mickey
and
he
was
a
pure
GSD
[prabipyakurel]
aww
how
you
pick
these
names
they
are
so
adorable
[sskarz]
Well
my
dad
had
another
dog
before
my
Mickey
,
and
his
first
dog
was
named
Mickey
but
that
passed
away
when
my
dad
was
in
his
early
20s
so
then
he
got
another
dog
when
I
was
around
6
years
old
and
we
had
Mickey
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
sorry
to
hear
that
[sskarz]
and
then
he
passed
away
when
I
was
around
14
no
its
okay
,
its
only
good
memories
with
him
[prabipyakurel]
yea
just
remember
the
good
moments
[sskarz]
14
or
15
when
he
passed
,
I
remember
I
was
in
sophomore
year
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
[sskarz]
and
I
came
back
home
one
day
after
a
week
being
worried
about
what
happened
to
Mickey
since
he
went
to
the
hospital
and
then
I
saw
a
new
small
dog
,
but
I
never
saw
Mickey
afterwards
so
it
kind
of
clicked
with
me
Bear
is
now
around
5
years
old
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
thats
nice
that
BIG
dog
is
5
excuse
me
[sskarz]
yeah
at
like
8
months
he
was
already
big
[prabipyakurel]
Or
maybe
i
am
just
dumb
but
i
thought
he
was
older
[sskarz]
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
a
pic
of
when
he
was
really
young
[prabipyakurel]
omg
i
love
baby
german
Shepherd
[sskarz]
In
the
meantime
,
here
’
s
a
pic
I
took
yesterday
when
I
let
him
inside
[prabipyakurel]
he
looks
like
he
is
having
such
a
good
nap
[sskarz]
Here
’
s
a
pic
I
took
after
a
week
of
having
him
❤
️
yeah
there
'
s
was
a
fan
next
to
him
that
was
just
blowing
on
his
face
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
that
is
so
adorable
,
I
would
hug
the
baby
one
like
i
dont
care
if
it
comps
on
me
,
I
would
just
hug
it
so
tightly
[sskarz]
that
cute
aggression
part
of
the
brain
😂
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Now
thats
life
😂
[sskarz]
yeah
he
was
adorable
but
he
only
stayed
like
that
for
like
a
month
before
he
just
exponentially
grew
in
size
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
by
his
first
birthday
,
he
was
already
as
tall
as
he
is
today
[prabipyakurel]
thats
really
fast
[sskarz]
yep
its
always
like
this
with
big
dog
breeds
except
my
friend
bijesh
,
he
has
a
tiny
golden
retriever
[prabipyakurel]
that
dudes
dog
was
not
tiny
I
remember
this
one
time
we
were
picking
up
something
from
their
first
thing
in
the
morning
,
and
omg
that
thing
sprinted
down
when
the
door
was
opened
for
us
[sskarz]
you
should
see
what
an
average
or
even
slightly
bigger
golden
retrievers
are
😂
[prabipyakurel]
cant
even
imagine
[sskarz]
awwwww
i
love
it
when
he
does
that
he
lays
down
for
belly
rubs
everytime
i
see
him
cutest
boi
ever
[prabipyakurel]
💀
this
is
the
type
of
person
I
am
look
cute
but
oh
when
a
dog
stares
at
me
in
a
suspicious
way
,
i
dont
care
of
that
dog
doesnt
bite
,
I
am
running
[sskarz]
but
he
just
wants
to
lick
you
[prabipyakurel]
or
bite
💀💀
who
knows
?
[sskarz]
nahhh
bijesh
'
s
dog
never
bites
unless
he
'
s
trying
to
play
[prabipyakurel]
thats
what
I
was
told
when
I
refused
to
go
in
through
the
front
door
that
morning
😂
[sskarz]
my
dog
tho
.....
yeah
you
have
a
fair
point
with
him
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
imma
need
to
have
someone
near
me
with
that
one
[sskarz]
even
I
can
'
t
stop
him
if
he
tries
to
go
for
somebody
💀
he
overpowers
me
if
he
tries
to
jump
on
me
with
full
force
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
cant
imagine
if
he
was
going
for
an
intruder
and
not
a
family
member
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lets
not
encounter
him
imma
be
that
intruder
,
he
gonna
look
at
me
and
be
like
oh
tiny
human
,
easy
💀
[sskarz]
you
just
have
to
be
around
him
for
long
enough
to
the
point
that
he
recognizes
you
👍
he
gets
a
lot
friendlier
especially
if
you
speak
Nepali
he
understands
it
all
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
speaking
to
that
dog
in
english
ever
again
nepali
it
is
[sskarz]
LOL
just
speak
nepali
,
give
him
treats
and
he
'
s
your
best
friend
[prabipyakurel]
anyway
,
you
were
explaining
your
bullying
incident
yesterday
,
and
I
totally
forgot
to
get
back
to
you
on
that
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
well
i
don
'
t
really
have
like
a
full
on
story
from
my
history
with
being
a
victim
of
bullying
it
never
affected
me
personally
like
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
oh
really
,
yea
you
were
strong
then
,
I
have
been
like
called
names
,
and
been
hated
on
for
no
reason
by
very
specific
people
.
[sskarz]
if
someone
ever
tried
to
call
me
names
or
even
physically
push
me
or
something
,
i
'
d
either
ignore
them
or
respond
with
a
remark
of
some
sort
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
a
pretty
good
strategy
[sskarz]
i
'
m
sorry
to
hear
that
,
i
know
im
not
like
the
average
person
dealing
with
bullying
and
it
does
affect
people
a
lot
i
hope
it
doesn
'
t
affect
you
at
all
oh
but
there
was
one
story
which
i
found
pretty
cool
back
when
i
was
in
elementary
school
[prabipyakurel]
lets
hear
it
[sskarz]
this
one
time
i
had
a
friend
named
Pablo
and
he
was
a
pretty
short
kid
and
he
used
to
get
bullied
by
these
group
of
dudes
that
were
bigger
and
taller
than
him
,
like
the
upperclassmen
.
anywho
one
day
I
was
just
walking
with
him
and
these
dudes
tried
to
instigate
something
with
Pablo
by
pushing
him
slightly
and
calling
him
some
dirty
stuff
and
we
were
on
the
playground
during
recess
.
at
some
point
,
for
some
reason
,
i
just
walked
up
to
one
of
the
guys
that
kept
harassing
him
and
straight
punched
him
in
the
face
,
and
then
i
took
pablo
and
left
.
apparently
,
shortly
after
I
found
out
that
I
actually
broke
a
part
of
his
nose
,
but
I
explained
the
situation
and
I
only
got
detention
for
about
2
days
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
you
are
a
really
good
friend
first
of
all
,
and
wow
you
were
quite
a
fighter
[sskarz]
they
never
tried
with
pablo
,
instead
i
was
the
one
that
they
kept
going
at
but
again
it
never
bothered
me
and
i
stopped
physically
dealing
with
them
[prabipyakurel]
he
probably
deserved
to
have
his
nose
broken
[sskarz]
me
fr
fr
oh
100
%
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
a
complete
douchebag
[prabipyakurel]
That
seemed
mean
honestly
I
have
been
in
your
friends
situation
and
it
went
on
for
a
while
too
yea
like
back
in
6th
and
7th
grade
there
were
these
boys
who
would
call
me
indian
,
and
i
had
told
them
many
times
that
I
am
not
indian
.
THen
they
would
start
talking
about
how
I
dont
belong
here
and
should
go
back
to
my
county
.
Just
brutal
,
I
would
be
crying
and
they
would
just
be
laughing
.
It
got
to
the
point
where
like
I
didn
'
t
want
to
come
to
school
because
I
would
see
them
.
But
in
8th
grade
we
were
good
and
they
stopped
doing
those
tasks
,
probably
because
i
had
answers
to
homework
and
stuff
.
But
yea
they
even
like
threw
dirt
on
my
face
and
stuff
like
that
.
As
memorable
as
middle
school
was
there
were
so
many
other
things
that
happened
that
still
makes
me
wonder
,
why
I
didnt
have
it
in
me
to
tell
anyone
or
say
anything
back
to
them
.
[sskarz]
oh
wow
,
I
'
m
sorry
you
had
to
deal
with
that
❤
️
people
like
that
just
don
'
t
make
sense
to
me
if
you
ever
experience
something
like
that
,
always
stand
up
for
yourself
,
if
not
then
have
someone
else
stand
up
for
you
,
otherwise
they
never
stop
❤
️
from
my
experience
[prabipyakurel]
And
yea
we
went
to
different
high
school
and
after
I
got
insta
one
of
them
requested
to
follow
me
,
so
i
was
like
its
been
a
while
,
lets
forgive
them
.
[sskarz]
that
'
s
nice
of
you
,
personally
if
i
had
experienced
what
you
went
through
,
no
way
in
hell
[prabipyakurel]
yea
my
best
friend
did
that
,
she
had
instagram
in
like
6th
grade
and
I
told
her
,
I
actually
cried
to
her
,
and
then
she
searched
his
name
,
and
messaged
him
directly
.
👍
[sskarz]
that
'
s
good
,
but
physical
confrontation
will
always
triumph
over
them
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
I
see
them
again
,
no
matter
how
much
they
apologized
,
what
they
did
will
kind
of
stay
with
me
[sskarz]
now
i
probably
got
lucky
,
since
i
used
to
taunt
alot
of
them
that
tried
to
harass
me
,
which
could
'
ve
ended
poorly
but
thank
god
they
weren
'
t
maniacs
yeah
I
can
imagine
so
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
thats
good
,
it
was
good
of
you
to
be
able
to
talkback
to
them
I
always
thought
they
were
gonna
blame
something
on
me
and
I
would
get
in
trouble
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
they
never
have
the
balls
to
do
anything
usually
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
older
I
got
I
realized
it
was
a
them
problem
not
me
💯
[sskarz]
i
mean
if
u
think
about
it
,
you
'
re
gonna
be
way
more
successful
than
them
in
the
future
,
and
that
'
s
how
i
always
thought
about
it
yk
?
like
eh
,
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
they
are
just
some
pebble
in
the
road
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
are
right
,
I
always
had
that
thought
on
the
back
of
my
head
[sskarz]
they
are
tiny
compared
to
our
real
ambitions
💯
[prabipyakurel]
100
%
true
mhm
for
sure
,
and
now
I
am
able
to
talk
back
to
someone
when
they
say
something
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
i
haven
'
t
watched
that
show
in
so
long
i
can
'
t
even
remember
the
name
but
i
used
to
watch
it
alongside
spongebob
[prabipyakurel]
the
sheep
one
,
what
show
is
that
wait
is
that
a
sheep
[sskarz]
all
i
knew
it
by
was
the
show
right
after
spongebob
stopped
airing
for
the
day
on
nickleodeon
yeah
its
a
sheep
[prabipyakurel]
lol
got
a
bit
confused
right
there
i
never
watched
spongebob
growing
up
my
go
to
was
tom
and
jerry
and
arthur
[sskarz]
:
O
oh
tom
and
jerry
is
a
banger
loved
that
show
too
i
'
d
say
80
%
of
the
shows
i
watched
as
a
kid
was
spongebob
to
the
point
there
was
a
time
in
my
life
where
i
had
memorized
every
single
episode
in
every
season
because
we
only
had
nickleodeon
on
cable
for
kids
shows
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
how
about
now
?
[sskarz]
its
foggy
,
but
if
i
saw
the
title
and
maybe
the
first
minute
i
'
d
probably
remember
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
we
had
just
the
normal
cable
and
stuck
to
PBS
kids
shows
[sskarz]
like
up
to
season
5
i
remember
the
clearest
ah
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
im
managing
some
of
my
finances
and
doing
some
work
i
backlogged
some
weeks
ago
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
not
really
💀
actually
quite
boring
and
too
much
math
[prabipyakurel]
math
is
painful
sometimes
its
good
math
but
mostly
its
bad
math
[sskarz]
i
loved
it
until
they
started
introducing
the
alphabet
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
why
did
they
do
that
i
thought
math
was
just
numbers
[sskarz]
fr
and
then
the
greek
alphabet
got
involved
and
im
like
why
😂
[prabipyakurel]
makes
no
sense
[sskarz]
physics
changed
me
forever
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
god
,
physics
was
scary
[sskarz]
rotational
physics
had
me
stressing
like
nothing
before
back
in
high
school
i
had
a
really
hard
ass
teacher
and
like
half
the
class
failed
[prabipyakurel]
that
looks
like
some
alien
language
lol
[sskarz]
i
ended
with
a
miracle
B
in
the
AP
Physics
class
never
again
[prabipyakurel]
b
isnt
bad
yea
I
am
done
with
physics
[sskarz]
only
1
person
got
an
A
and
like
6
people
got
a
B
💀
that
teacher
wanted
people
to
fail
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
that
one
person
💀
[sskarz]
he
was

he
did
sports
on
the
side
too
[prabipyakurel]
yea
my
gpa

just
average
damn
,
that
must
have
been
hard
to
manage
hats
off
to
that
dude
[sskarz]
right
?
i
was
always
in
awe
of
his
work
ethic
same

average
among
the
others
that
had
like
a
4
.
80
thank
you
Yea
and
I
would
have
had
a
4
.
50
but
there
was
this
English
assignment
that
dropped
my
grade
to
a
B
Its
crazy
,
but
watch
its
probably
gonna
drop
when
I
got
to
college
[sskarz]
hold
on
parents
calling
me
,
i
'
ll
brb
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
okay
im
back
had
some
food
in
the
meantime
[prabipyakurel]
are
you
having
brunch
?
[sskarz]
yeah
basically
,
but
it
was
like
a
snack
[prabipyakurel]
oh
nice
[sskarz]
had
some
protein
yogurt
and
some
chicken
[prabipyakurel]
seems
pretty
good
greek
yogurt
?
[sskarz]
i
got
a
call
from
my
parents
,
and
apparently
they
read
their
return
date
wrong
from
vacation
,
was
originally
the
18th
,
but
its
the
21st
now
so
yippeeeeee
more
me
time
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
[sskarz]
nah
its
a
different
brand
👍
[prabipyakurel]
thats
still
a
while
[sskarz]
yeah
a
week
and
3
days
[prabipyakurel]
you
can
do
a
lot
of
things
in
a
week
and
3
days
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
unfortunately
im
an
introvert
so
its
probably
gonna
be
spent
at
home
with
the
AC
on
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
sometimes
the
breeze
hits
our
house
so
we
leave
the
backyard
gate
open
[sskarz]
ah
nice
that
doesn
'
t
mean
someone
could
just
stroll
on
in
right
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
we
have
2
doors
,
one
is
a
metal
one
outside
and
the
second
is
glass
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
i
do
the
same
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
someone
strolled
in
like
hi
,
can
i
come
in
[sskarz]
omg
i
love
this
guy
'
s
jokes
💀
oh
hell
naw
💀
[prabipyakurel]
did
i
tell
you
about
the
incident
where
my
parents
thought
we
got
kidnapped
[sskarz]
no
????????
but
am
interested
[prabipyakurel]
So
i
think
it
was
like
2
weeks
ago
like
around
2
pm
the
power
went
out
on
this
house
and
our
neighbors
And
with
no
internet
,
the
ring
camera
all
around
stopped
working
,
the
wifi
was
no
longer
here
,
and
data
decided
to
give
up
.
We
couldnt
call
anyone
or
text
or
message
anyone
neither
could
we
receive
any
calls
and
then
my
dad
tried
several
times
from
work
to
chek
what
was
wrong
with
the
camera
THey
thought
someone
broke
in
and
broke
the
camera
too
My
mom
left
work
in
an
emergency
and
thought
someone
broke
in
but
thankfully
the
power
came
back
as
she
was
on
her
way
and
I
got
scolded
first
then
they
understood
It
was
kinda
hilarious
but
they
were
like
panicking
,
so
I
felt
bad
for
them
.
😂
yea
that
pretty
much
sums
up
everything
[sskarz]
omg
that
'
s
scary
tho
as
a
parent
i
would
'
ve
been
panicking
[prabipyakurel]
yea
we
were
kinda
assuming
one
of
them
were
gonna
come
home
to
check
[sskarz]
that
is
pretty
terrifying
even
from
your
perspective
tho
i
would
'
ve
grabbed
some
kind
of
weapon
just
in
case
i
was
about
to
get
robbed
or
something
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
and
our
neighborhood
is
quiet
,
no
one
is
out
on
sthe
streets
or
anyting
during
the
day
lol
yea
we
just
locked
our
doors
if
anything
we
were
going
to
take
a
walk
to
the
south
el
monte
city
hall
down
the
street
and
as
if
we
can
make
a
call
.
that
was
like
our
only
option
[sskarz]
ah
that
makes
sense
yeah
I
would
'
ve
gone
to
the
nearest
gas
station
or
something
to
ask
to
make
a
call
but
idk
with
the
power
gone
,
maybe
that
wouldn
'
t
have
worked
[prabipyakurel]
yea
maybe
maybe
,
how
you
guys
charge
tesla
with
the
power
gone
?
I
don
'
t
know
if
this
is
a
dumb
question
.
[sskarz]
well
we
have
a
backup
power
source
,
but
we
wouldn
'
t
charge
the
tesla
at
home
since
I
'
m
not
sure
it
can
support
charging
the
car
with
the
backup
generator
in
that
case
,
if
we
have
some
miles
left
,
then
we
would
just
drive
down
to
the
nearest
super
charger
and
charge
there
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
I
see
[sskarz]
and
if
that
didn
'
t
work
,
then
we
also
have
gas
cars
to
use
just
in
case
they
are
all
dead
in
battery
,
which
the
chance
of
that
happening
is
basically
0
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
thats
sounds
good
[sskarz]
we
haven
'
t
had
a
power
outage
in
a
while
tho
,
if
we
do
then
its
usually
my
room
💀
sometimes
i
use
a
bit
too
much
power
than
intended
and
then
shuts
off
in
the
breaker
[prabipyakurel]
lol
just
your
room
[sskarz]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
rip
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
a
computer
that
takes
around
850
Watts
on
its
own
,
then
an
entire
AC
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
[sskarz]
that
doesn
'
t
include
the
house
AC
,
literally
just
an
AC
unit
yeah
so
if
i
keep
both
on
for
a
very
long
time
and
both
are
at
full
use
,
it
can
shut
down
the
entire
room
its
happened
like
twice
in
the
last
4
years
so
its
not
a
big
issue
but
its
there
lol
[prabipyakurel]
thats
crazy
lol
[sskarz]
so
what
are
you
doing
rn
?
[prabipyakurel]
About
to
have
lunch
rn
,
need
to
go
plate

.
[sskarz]

'
re
you
having
?
[prabipyakurel]
than
i
will
probably
be
bored
[sskarz]
the
summertime
classic
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]

my
parents

to
me
spending
even
more
money
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol

to
best

again
[sskarz]
Amazon

’
s
Amazon
day

[sskarz]
and
then
tech
is
usually
on
crazy
sales
[prabipyakurel]
amazon
day
[sskarz]
and
I
like
to
look
at
the
deals
Now
then
it
hit
me
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
bought
all
my
pc
components
before
this
,
and
then
I
checked
the
price
of
everything
during
this
sale
I
could
’
ve
saved
like
300
dollars
[prabipyakurel]
could
have
but
you
didnt
💀
💀
[sskarz]
and
then
I
looked
at
tech
I
wanted
to
upgrade
😅
oops
there
goes
800
bucks
[prabipyakurel]
yep
,
you
were
probably
like

GOOD
EXPLANATION

bucks
worth
[sskarz]
so
like
this
product
Was
originally
800
dollars
BUT
it
went
on
sale
FOR
380
so
I
got
2
[prabipyakurel]
so
what
about
the
remaining
$
40
and
why

get
2
of
the
same
thing
?
[sskarz]
Taxes
Uh
[prabipyakurel]

💀
[sskarz]
so

could
have
a
friend

gonna
be
lonely
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
u
just
gotta
get
it

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
have
disabled
Amazon
from
my
web
browser
for
the
next
5
months
💀

too
dangerous
[prabipyakurel]
yea

keep
it
away
from
you
like
away
away
its
like
covid
for
you
[sskarz]
but
like
the
deal

like
pretty
good
[prabipyakurel]
think
of
it
that
way
but
why
2
[sskarz]

it
just
makes
sense
trust
me
[prabipyakurel]
-
Inanimate
objects
dont
need
friends
they
can
be
lonely
👉
👈
[sskarz]
it
most
definitely
needed
a
friend
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[sskarz]
i
also
just
got
paid
so
like
worth
it
mhmm
[prabipyakurel]
might
as
well
get
a
friend
for
that
computer
you
put
together
the
other
day
right
,
spend
it
as
soon
as
you
get
it
thats
the
correct
way
to
live
life
genius
[sskarz]
seeeeee
exactlyyyyyyyy
well
this
was
after
i
put
my
money
into
savings
and
stuff
like
that
stuff
still
comes
first
this
is
just
what
i
had
left
over
to
spend
[prabipyakurel]
oh
okay
,
at
least
you
did
that
[sskarz]
u
gotta
be
financially
educated
(
amazon
is
my
weakness
)
[prabipyakurel]
keep
it
away
from
you
but
thats
also
me
when
my
dad
is
ordering
something
and
goes
do
you
have
anything
to
get
from
amazon
,
and
then
it
gets
fun
.
[sskarz]
hahahaha
so
much
fun
[prabipyakurel]
yep
just
add
it
to
his
cart
[sskarz]
exactly
its
even
worse
when
my
dad
and
i
go
to
any
hardware
store
we
go
there
for
like
one
thing
only
and
then
come
out
with
5
things
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
we
both
have
a
bad
relationship
with
shopping
tech
😂
if
we
see
something
on
sale
for
like
0
.
1
%
its
already
in
the
cart
[prabipyakurel]
0
.
1
%
[sskarz]
yes
[prabipyakurel]
I
do
that
with
food
yea
last
time
I
went
to
best
buy
because
my
dad
needed
something
I
was
dying
of
boredom
in
there
I
was
trying
to
take
pictures
of
me
from
the
phones
on
display
lol
😂
[sskarz]
omg
one
of
my
favorite
places
ever
(
my
wallet
will
never
recover
)
[prabipyakurel]
then
dont
go
in
there
,
tell
someone
to
get
what
you
need
for
you
[sskarz]
but
see
that
'
s
no
fun
its
like
candyland
who
doesn
'
t
want
to
be
in
candyland
[prabipyakurel]
not
that
type
of
candyland
costco
and
grocery
stores
are
on
another
level
the
best
thing
I
found
at
best
buy
were
lego
sets
those
looked
pretty
interesting
[sskarz]
ironically
that
'
s
the
place
where
i
get
what
i
need
and
i
get
out
💀
don
'
t
tempt
me
with
the
lego
death
star
[prabipyakurel]
you
mean
you
dont
go
to
costco
,
and
start
from
the
first
isle
to
the
end
looking
for
things
you
can
possibly
get
[sskarz]
no
no
i
get
lost
for
a
good
bit
of
time
,
but
im
just
hyper
focused
on
getting
the
stuff
and
getting
out
👍
[prabipyakurel]
legos
are
pretty
fun
tho
[sskarz]
legos
are
super
funnnn
used
to
love
building
stuff
as
a
little
kid
[prabipyakurel]
yea
they
are
fun
until
you
get
2
small
ones
stuck
where
they
shouldn
'
t
be
and
you
got
no
nails
to
separate
them
[sskarz]
oh
no
the
3x2
small
pieces
that
are
stuck
together
forever
[prabipyakurel]
yea
those
omg
like
you
are
done
,
might
as
well
stop
trying
[sskarz]
yep
i
saw
someone
on
tiktok
use
oil
on
their
fingers
,
and
still
took
it
apart
they
had
superhuman
finger
grip
strength
[prabipyakurel]
wont
that
just
make
it
more
harder
thats
why
i
got
no
grip
[sskarz]
same
[prabipyakurel]
also
why
is
your
profile
picture
a
penguin
lifting
weights
?
i
was
just
wondering
[sskarz]
i
have
no
idea
i
just
thought
it
looked
cool
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
it
doesnt
look
bad
[sskarz]
like
a
little
penguin
doing
bench
press
just
looks
funny
to
me
its
also
the
little
penguin
from
adventure
time
gunter
was
his
name

👋
Hello
again
,
so
how
has
the
rest
of
your
day
been
like
,
you
know
aside
from
your
dangerous
amazon
shopping
spree
?
[sskarz]
well
do
you
want
the
long
answer
or
the
short
answer
,
or
a
list
of
pros
and
cons
[prabipyakurel]
lets
go
with
the
pros
and
cons
i
like
how
you
have
options
of
explaining
it
must
have
been
interesting
lol
[sskarz]
pros
:
just
had
dinner
my
dog
hugged
me
had
a
meeting
where
i
didn
'
t
have
to
do
much
cons
:
my
computer
literally
died
i
had
to
troubleshoot
it
for
4
hours
straight
and
I
'
ve
finally
gotten
to
a
stable
position
my
mental
health
is
dwindling
as
my
PC
dwindles
i
had
a
meeting
during
all
of
that
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
little
doggy
hug
,
the
meeting
seems
pretty
easy
,
what
did
you
have
for
dinner
?
time
to
get
your
computer
a
friend
I
guess
,
you
know
so
when
one
died
its
friend
can
replace
it
💀
[sskarz]
i
just
ordered
panda
express
,
i
had
no
time
nor
mental
sanity
to
make
something
at
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
but
aside
fom
jokes
I
hope
your
computer
is
fine
tho
,
computer
is
essential
for
you
especially
[sskarz]
its
uh
,
stable
somewhat
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Panda
express
is
awesome
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
what
is
your
favorite
from
panda
?
you
dont
eat
beef
do
you
?
[sskarz]
i
just
get
a
plate
with
chowmein
and
orange
chicken
very
rarely
if
ever
👍
[prabipyakurel]
ahh
yep
chowmein
is
good
,
orange
chicken
honestly
depends
on
the
mood
,
and
I
usually
get
shrimp
on
the
side
.
[sskarz]
never
tried
the
shrimp
tbh
,
panda
is
just
my
comfort
food
that
i
know
is
gonna
be
decent
and
something
i
need
in
a
pinch
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
and
you
have
NEVER
tried
shimp
,
like
at
all
,
or
just
from
panda
?
[sskarz]
i
ordered
delivery
,
it
went
from
a
14
dollar
meal
to
20
,
that
was
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
no
no
i
'
ve
never
had
shrimp
from
panda
i
have
had
shrimp
before
i
like
shrimp
lol
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
but
you
should
try
the
one
from
panda
,
its
the
best
thing
there
I
have
never
had
a
panda
meal
without
shrimp
[sskarz]
will
try
it
next
time
for
sure
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
me
too
,
its
awesome
[sskarz]
how
'
s
your
day
gone
so
far
[prabipyakurel]
um
well
our
parents
are
out
and
went
to
the
mandir
,
so
i
made
chicken
fried
rice
and
my
dad
brought
pizza
again
anyway
so
we
wont
stay
hungry
.
Um
other
than
that
I
studied
for
a
while
,
took
a
nap
,
and
watched
TV
.
Nothing
too
special
,
and
took
care
of
some
essentials
for
class
enrollment
[sskarz]
Nice
seems
like
a
peaceful
day
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
pretty
calm
[sskarz]
I
yearn
for
those
days
back
lol
Today
has
been
way
too
hectic
[prabipyakurel]
yea
these
are
probably
my
last
peaceful
days
too
[sskarz]
Nah
you
got
a
whole
month
left
You
should
take
it
easy
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
its
okay
it
happens
,
but
like
if
you
struggle
a
bit
right
now
,
you
will
be
at
ease
in
the
future
too
.
❤
️
Thanks
!
I
try
my
best
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
my
motto
in
life
fr
💯
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
,
sometimes
I
feel
like
I
don
'
t
like
even
know
what
I
am
doing
,
but
then
I
am
like
at
least
I
have
a
plan
and
an
aim
to
do
something
.
and
then
it
feels
better
.
[sskarz]
gotta
remember
who
actually
knows
what
they
'
re
doing
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
likely
,
not
a
lot
of
people
lol
if
you
have
some
sense
of
direction
,
already
ahead
of
everyone
else
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
like
thinking
of
it
that
way
,
like
looking
at
how
people
now
always
like
wonder
around
no
knowing
what
it
right
for
them
is
kind
of
sad
,
but
makes
me
feel
assured
that
I
have
some
sense
of
direction
in
life
.
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
i
saw
that
from
some
motivational
video
i
saw
on
youtube
like
some
years
ago
had
real
statistics
behind
it
as
well
[prabipyakurel]
oh
like
one
of
those
ted
talks
do
you
watch
ted
talks
?
[sskarz]
yeah
i
do
or
used
to
anyhow
[prabipyakurel]
yea
me
too
,
not
so
much
anymore
[sskarz]
idk
if
you
'
ve
watched
it
but
there
was
that
one
ted
talk
episode
where
a
guy
perfectly
describes
procrastination
and
how
it
works
in
the
brain
and
it
used
like
a
monkey
steering
a
ship
as
an
example
or
something
like
that
it
was
one
of
the
more
popular
episodes
[prabipyakurel]
OH
wow
,
maybe
i
have
not
seen
that
but
I
will
check
it
out
[sskarz]
yeah
its
pretty
insightful
for
how
it
works
but
explained
in
a
very
easy
to
understand
way
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
sometimes
like
you
need
to
hear
someone
explain
to
you
that
its
fine
to
be
behind
like
a
week
ago
I
was
talking
to
my
berkeley
academic
advisor
and
she
was
talking
to
like
a
group
of
people
including
me
and
was
like
"
its
okay
to
feel
lost
sometimes
and
feel
like
you
are
behind
,
but
you
have
to
look
back
at
how
much
you
have
progressed
"
and
that
hit
me
.
Now
I
take
my
time
instead
of
stressing
myself
out
,
somewhat
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
you
'
ve
got
a
really
smart
advisor
for
sure
100
%
agreed
with
that
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
i
'
m
having
more
issues
with
the
computer
,
just
encountered
another
crash
and
its
driving
me
nuts
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
shoot
,
yea
hopefully
you
can
get
it
fixed
.
maybe
call
your
dad
for
help
[sskarz]
nah
I
got
this
he
'
s
on
vacation
for
a
reason
[prabipyakurel]
thats
the
spirit
[sskarz]
I
don
'
t
wanna
bother
him
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
Well
good
luck
on
that
[sskarz]
thanks
!
i
'
m
gonna
need
it
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
sure
you
got
it
tho
,
you
are
like
a
pro
at
this
tech
thing
[sskarz]
i
thought
so
too
😂
🫠
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
are
,
dw
you
are
gonna
fix
it
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
eventually
[sskarz]
me
to
my
computer
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
yep
think
of
it
as
like
a
challenge
[sskarz]
a
very
expensive
challenge
that
i
pray
doesn
'
t
accidentally
blow
up
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
probably
you
everytime
something
techy
goes
wrong
this
is
why
you
get
it
a
friend
so
if
one
friend
blows
up
,
the
other
is
there
💀
[sskarz]
trust
me
,
the
800
dollars
didn
'
t
even
go
to
another
computer
💀
this
one
all
alone
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
well
lets
pray
it
doesnt
blow
up
then
be
careful
and
go
slow
dont
start
like
a
fire
or
something
in
the
process
either
[sskarz]
no
promises
;
D
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
your
room
in
a
hour
lol
[sskarz]
sounds
about
right
💀
[prabipyakurel]
if
i
hear
fire
truck
siren
around
the
area
i
will
know
where
they
are
going
.
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
i
'
ll
have
a
fire
signal
😂
[prabipyakurel]
but
in
the
meantime
,
go
for
it
.
I
don
'
t
wanna
disturb
you
.
I
will
talk
to
you
later
,
when
you
fix
your
computer
.
[sskarz]

the
moment

[sskarz]
hey
hey
!
good
afternoon
I
'
ve
finally
been
able
to
text
without
running
around
everywhere
since
the
morning
lol
how
did
your
class
picking
go
?
[prabipyakurel]
omg
its
been
a
day
.
I
had
a
small
breakdown
for
the
past
few
hours
but
now
things
are
looking
a
little
better
.
[sskarz]
oh
why
'
s
that
if
I
could
ask
?
are
you
okay
?
[prabipyakurel]
Shooting
your
head
Yea
,
I
am
okay
now
,
its
because
I
had
my
classes
chosen
and
my
enrollment
period
began
at
12
:
40
.
However
everyone
had
different
time
slots
and
those
that
had
the
time
from
9
:
00
to
11
:
00
,
they
picked
out
all
the
english
classes
and
social
science
classes
.
I
hate
the
UC
berkeley
system
right
now
.
[sskarz]
omg
what
?!
what
did
you
choose
for
your
classes
then
?
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
have
been
just
scrolling
to
find
a
physical
science
class
for
the
past
30
minutes
that
doesnt
mess
with
my
schedule
and
fits
the
time
.
Well
...
so
far
I
got
Math
,
History
(
not
the
most
interesting
),
and
Sociology
[sskarz]
okay
at
least
you
got
your
main
courses
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
its
okay
,
you
can
waitlist
and
wait
for
people
to
drop
,
but
also
at
least
this
isn
'
t
a
major
course
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
I
asked
and
the
english
can
be
taken
in
the
spring
semester
.
And
because
everyone
was
on
the
site
,
it
was
loading
so
much
,
I
wanted
to
throw
my
laptop
downstairs
.
I
even
sat
next
to
the
wifi
routers
for
it
to
load
faster
.
[sskarz]
awesome
!
just
switch
it
out
for
another
course
you
'
ll
have
to
take
in
spring
and
you
should
be
golden
still
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
,
yea
hopefully
.
👍
[sskarz]
unfortunately
this
stuff
can
suck
,
maybe
next
semester
you
can
get
into
early
enrollment
programs
?
I
'
m
pretty
sure
every
uni
has
them
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
hoping
they
do
that
,
I
was
mad
like
I
was
going
crazy
,
this
was
certainly
not
fair
.
And
I
just
talked
to
my
friend
that
is
also
going
to
Berkeley
and
she
has
to
redo
her
class
pick
entirely
.
😲
I
feel
bad
for
her
.
They
made
something
as
simple
as
picking
classes
so
difficult
.
\
[sskarz]
omg
wtf
that
'
s
insane
so
they
just
lucked
out
because
they
had
an
earlier
time
than
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
[sskarz]
that
'
s
just
bullshit
(
excuse
my
language
)
[prabipyakurel]
No
dw
I
was
cussing
all
morning
[sskarz]
I
would
throw
hands
too
wtf
[prabipyakurel]
Evil
,
if
they
opened
it
at
once
for
everyone
and
I
didnt
get
it
,
thats
on
me
,
but
there
were
no
openings
to
begin
with
.
likewise
[sskarz]
so
are
you
planning
on
sitting
in
waitlist
or
have
you
picked
out
your
last
class
yet
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
going
to
rely
on
waitlist
,
I
am
trying
to
pick
one
more
class
that
will
fufill
the
philosophy
or
physical
science
requirement
.
[sskarz]
have
you
got
a
class
in
mind
to
fulfill
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
I
find
one
and
think
its
good
,
the
seats
are
filled
.
searching
[sskarz]
I
see
...
I
'
ll
channel
all
of
my
energy
into
you
finding
that
class
🫡
[prabipyakurel]
I

probably
will
be
a
lot
of
writing
but
you
get
to
answer
the
important
questions
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I

"
what

s
for
dinner
"
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

?
that
is
even
more
stressful
lol
same
!
[prabipyakurel]
those
educational
high
school
memories
[sskarz]
i
had
like
the
best
english
teacher
back
then
we
had
like
seminars
to
discuss
the
book
themes
and
stuff
,
but
it
used
to
always
be
fun
because
even
our
teacher
would
join
in
the
conversation
actively
[prabipyakurel]
lol
me
too
,
i
follow
her
on
insta
now
so
...
[sskarz]
nice
!
english
teachers
are
usually
the
nicer
ones
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yea
omg
the
seminar
was
on
this
book
and
the
cruicible
when
that
one
girl
wouldnt
stop
talking
💀
Yea
they
are
amazing
!
💯
[sskarz]
you
know
i
never
asked
i
don
'
t
think
favorite
school
subject
?
[prabipyakurel]
English
Writing
to
be
specific
.
u
?
Government
too
.
[sskarz]
computer
science
probably
but
if
not
that
then
english
i
like
writing
essays
strangely
even
tho
my
grammar
is
terrible
💀
[prabipyakurel]
😅
[sskarz]
we
writer
buddies
i
should
'
ve
seen
that
one
coming
💀
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
we
should
create
a
story
together
mhm
lol
[sskarz]
yooooooo
i
'
d
be
so
down
but
what
kind
of
story
would
it
be
?
[prabipyakurel]
Horror
Or
some
adventure
one
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
actually
never
dabbled
in
reading
or
writing
horror
books
except
like
the
goosebumps
series
back
in
elementary
school
that
sounds
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
,
but
writing
in
fiction
is
pretty
interesting
,
it
can
be
taken
different
ways
.
[sskarz]
i
mean
it
doesn
'
t
have
to
be
supernatural
,
it
could
be
like
a
michael
myers
situation
fiction
horror
does
open
more
doors
tho
[prabipyakurel]
We
should
think
about
that
though
!
[sskarz]
do
you
have
experience
in
reading
or
writing
horror
books
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
tried
writing
but
I
lost
all
those
,
but
I
used
to
read
a
bunch
of
those
goosebump
series
and
short
horror
stories
.
I
used
to
pick
a
book
with
multiple
short
horror
stories
.
Like
it
was
quick
and
short
.
[sskarz]
i
feel
like
everyone
starts
with
the
goosebump
series
lol
have
you
read
IT
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
half
of
it
,
but
like
clowns
arent
scary
to
me
,
so
I
lost
interest
in
it
.
[sskarz]
oh
really
?
i
absolutely
hate
clowns
i
couldn
'
t
finish
that
book
because
it
was
1
.
spooky
2
.
1000
pages
so
...
what
are
you
scared
of
?
[prabipyakurel]
Spiders
[sskarz]
oh
true
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Like
if
i
put
a
clown
pic
,
will
you
get
scared
.
[sskarz]
not
really
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
but
like
if
u
see
one
,
you
will
get
scared
?
[sskarz]
unless
it
is
built
up
,
not
much
💀
i
would
be
creeped
out
for
sure
like
if
i
was
walking
a
road
just
barely
lit
up
with
broken
street
lights
and
i
saw
a
silhouette
of
a
clown
,
im
running
the
other
direction
like
see
how
its
built
up
with
the
settings
beforehand
,
that
scares
me
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
well
if
I
am
walking
with
you
I
will
save
you
[sskarz]
but
if
i
was
just
shown
a
picture
of
a
clown
its
like
eh
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
dw
i
got
u
from
spiders
so
we
'
re
a
perfect
team
😂
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
literally
talking
about
bringing
a
foam
spider
last
time
💀
[sskarz]
that
was
a
joke
💀
or
...
is
it
?
jk
jk
jk
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
i
was
kidding
too
,
foam
spider
wont
be
too
much
of
an
issue
[sskarz]
*
2
foam
spiders
*
now
it
sounds
like
a
good
idea
lmao
*
now
before
i
get
my
head
twisted
,
in
legal
terms
this
is
a
joke
*
ok
but
other
than
spiders
,
like
a
horror
element
that
scares
you
?
like
ghosts
,
dead
people
,
etc
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry
went
to
the
bathroom
real
quick
.
Um
other
than
that
,
like
if
someone
is
choking
on
food
,
idk
why
,
I
will
freeze
and
like
freak
out
.
Occasionally
large
bodies
of
water
,
and
being
alone
in
the
middle
.
[sskarz]
so
the
ocean
,
and
being
alone
in
the
middle
......
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
*
this
sounds
all
too
familiar
*
*
cough
*
submarine
*
cough
*
[prabipyakurel]
Right
exactly
,
being
stuck
too
deep
into
water
And
also
because
if
I
get
stuck
in
water
deeper
than
4
feet
,
I
wont
make
it
out
.
[sskarz]
💀
you
still
got
11
inches
of
head
room
[prabipyakurel]
Not
enough
You
can
swim
right
?
[sskarz]
so
how
about
like
a
stranded
ocean
story
where
the
characters
go
through
the
horrors
of
living
in
the
ocean
alone
without
anything
,
maybe
encounter
an
island
or
something
and
something
scary
lurks
there
yep
,
i
used
to
train
back
in
middle
school
days
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
that
,
it
is
eerie
Yea
my
swimming
is
bad
bad
[sskarz]
never
too
late
to
learn
!
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
only
be
in
the
water
if
I
can
at
least
tiptoe
on
the
pool
floor
[sskarz]
oh
easy
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
sometime
in
the
future
,
I
will
learn
.
Its
funny
because
my
dad
used
to
train
both
me
and
my
brother
,
but
then
I
was
just
always
scared
and
needed
someone
next
to
me
.
And
I
am
sure
I
would
still
freak
out
if
I
tried
now
too
.
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
you
won
'
t
drown
,
just
gotta
paddle
it
out
did
your
dad
ever
just
launch
you
into
like
an
8
ft
pool
?
[prabipyakurel]
OH
NAH
,
He
knew
I
couldn
'
t
get
past
5
feet
before
panicking
you
?
Is
that
how
you
learned
omg
[sskarz]
yep
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
gonna
try
if
I
am
ever
in
the
situation
.
[sskarz]
my
dad
literally
threw
me
in
repeatedly
i
got
gaslight
every
single
time
💀
[prabipyakurel]
I
hope
he
came
after
you
too
[sskarz]
after
i
struggled
for
a
bit
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
motto
of
my
life
lol
accurate
😂
[prabipyakurel]
WOW
thats
a
way
to
learn
Thats
cool
though
,
probably
the
first
time
I
have
heard
someone
learn
swimming
straight
from
8
feet
.
[sskarz]
haha
my
dad
did
the
same
thing
with
paragliding
have
i
told
you
the
story
?
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
no
but
I
am
interested
Go
on
...
[sskarz]
so
basically
,
this
was
when
the
new
movie
Transformers
3
came
out
,
and
as
you
know
,
i
love
seeing
big
robots
fighting
each
other
,
and
at
the
time
,
i
was
at
Nepal
,
and
the
movie
had
just
reached
the
theaters
in
Nepal
.
that
day
,
I
wanted
to
watch
the
movie
,
but
we
ended
up
scaling
a
large
mountain
for
paragliding
,
but
I
really
didn
'
t
want
to
do
it
and
everyone
else
wanted
to
.
so
at
the
peak
of
the
mountain
,
my
dad
told
me
that
i
could
watch
the
movie
right
after
paragliding
with
everyone
else
,
and
i
took
the
bet
needless
to
say
it
,
there
was
a
lot
of
screaming
and
i
was
scared
to
death
💀
I
did
get
to
watch
the
movie
the
same
day
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry
that
was
a
very
funny
story
,
how
old
were
you
at
the
time
?
[sskarz]
i
'
m
glad
it
was
funny
😂
👍
let
me
search
up
when
that
movie
came
out
2011
so
12
?
I
was
12
[prabipyakurel]
probably
12
i
am
assuming
[sskarz]
mathematically
yes
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
you
werent
a
baby
baby
,
but
I
can
understand
.
[sskarz]
it
was
like
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
feet
in
the
air
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
go
alone
,
or
with
someone
else
?
[sskarz]
and
i
was
scared
of
heights
at
the
time
i
was
attached
to
the
guy
that
flew
the
paraglider
so
he
steered
me
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
I
had
that
phase
too
,
I
used
be
scared
when
dad
would
drive
uphill
and
stuff
.
Ahhh
well
at
least
you
didn
'
t
go
alone
.
You
would
be
fine
doing
that
now
right
?
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
i
'
d
be
happy
to
go
paragliding
again
that
'
s
why
i
wanna
sky
dive
lol
im
not
scared
of
heights
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
dw
we
all
had
that
phase
,
paragliding
and
skydiving
look
so
fun
.
[sskarz]
right
!
idk
lots
of
my
fears
are
gone
because
my
dad
just
threw
me
into
the
danger
and
i
was
like
,
well
then
it
ain
'
t
that
bad
applies
to
like
everything
i
do
lol
what
are
your
biggest
fears
?
apart
from
spiders
[prabipyakurel]
um
...
I
have
always
been
scared
to
be
in
an
elevator
alone
[sskarz]
how
come
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
its
because
I
have
read
and
heard
many
stories
of
death
on
elevators
or
when
it
malfunctions
and
you
are
stuck
in
there
for
good
.
Maybe
I
am
being
overdramatic
,
but
I
would
rather
walk
up
a
bunch
of
stairs
than
take
it
alone
.
I
have
done
it
before
,
it
just
makes
my
heart
beat
faster
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
i
see
im
scared
more
of
that
little
gap
between
the
floor
and
the
elevator
,
always
thinking
im
gonna
drop
my
phone
in
that
small
gap
intrusive
thoughts
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
that
too
Have
you
ever
been
somewhere
for
the
first
time
and
you
automatically
think
about
what
can
go
wrong
?
[sskarz]
oh
easily
tho
i
try
not
to
think
too
much
on
it
for
me
its
like
thinking
of
where
the
exits
are
in
every
room
in
case
of
a
shooter
or
something
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
usually
look
for
exits
too
or
what
I
have
with
me
that
can
come
in
handy
in
case
something
happens
in
a
situation
.
But
other
than
spiders
,
drowning
,
someone
choking
,
elevators
,
and
large
bodies
of
water
,
I
dont
think
I
am
too
scared
of
anything
else
.
[sskarz]
and
those
are
somewhat
rare
so
that
'
s
good
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
well
,
i
'
m
going
to
head
to
bed
early
,
need
to
wake
up
early
tomorrow
to
be
a
good
teacher
hope
you
have
a
good
night

I

But

is
going
well
at
the
moment
,
nothing
too
good
and
nothing
too
bad
.
How
about
you
?
How
are
you
feeling
after
fixing
all
those
issues
?
[sskarz]
You

re

lol
,
seems

?
I
finally

normal
day
where
nothing

so
I
'
m
chillin
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
thats
nice
.
So
you
have
any
other
plans
for
the
week
?
[sskarz]
for
the
first
time
in
forever
,
not
really
apart
from
some
meetings
and
tiny
bits
of
work
,
nope
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
pretty
calm
.
Um
nothing
too
much
,
just
going
to
prepare
for
college
.
Get
a
headstart
on
reviewing
descriptions
for
some
subjects
.
[sskarz]
what
subjects
are
you
reviewing
for
?
and
which
book
are
you
going
to
start
with
for
english
[prabipyakurel]
I
forgot
most
of
Frankenstein
,
so
gonna
start
with
that
.
And
for
subjects
,
I
will
look
into
Sociology
,
the
terms
and
general
information
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
gonna
read
the
entire
book
?
or
like
sparknotes
it
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
I
am
sorry
for
leaving
you
hanging
.
I
was
looking
through
gmail
and
for
some
reason
couldn
’
t
access
some
accounts
for
books
and
stuff
.
Then
I
was
called
to
eat
and
completely
forgot
to
get
back
to
you
.
But
yea
I
am
obviously
going
to
spark
notes
it
for
rn
.
[sskarz]
Hey
no
you
’
re
fine
dw
about
it
,
you
got
stuff
to
do
and
prepare
for
👍.
Yeah
getting
a
good
overview
for
the
foundation
of
all
the
books
would
be
a
pretty
smart
move
,
considering
you
’
re
probably
going
to
be
writing
a
lot
about
themes
and
motifs
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
and
yea
I
appreciate
your
understanding
,
sometimes
I
have
a
bad
habit
of
starting
many
things
at
once
and
like
getting
everything
mixed
up
.
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
,
I
know
what
that
feels
like
😂
I
completely
understand
no
need
to
apologize
at
all
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
after
dinner
I
was
like
omg
I
literally
left
him
hanging
in
a
chat
,
I
was
like
he
is
probably
not
gonna
reply
anymore
.
😅
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
’
m
awake
so
I
’
m
able
to
lol
planning
on
staying
up
and
just
relaxing
tonight
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
Were
you
able
to
rest
today
?
[sskarz]
All
day
mhmmm
Felt
great
❤
️
you
’
re
on
the
study
grind
tho
,
are
you
feeling
confident
?
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
,
I
felt
pretty
confident
in
the
beginning
but
now
looking
at
everything
I
am
not
going
to
lie
,
I
feel
a
lot
more
scared
.
But
I
think
that
if
I
put
all
those
little
worries
behind
me
,
I
can
probably
pull
through
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
Try
not
to
overwhelm
yourself
,
take
it
step
by
step
,
or
class
by
class
and
I
assure
you
,
you
’
re
going
to
be
more
than
fine
❤
️
just
don
’
t
take
it
in
all
at
once
plus
you
’
ve
got
a
lot
of
time
ahead
of
you
so
don
’
t
try
to
cram
every
bit
of
syllabus
knowledge
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
!
Yes
definitely
I
will
be
taking
it
little
by
little
so
I
don
'
t
mess
up
anywhere
.
Its
just
that
feeling
that
hits
me
at
the
most
random
time
of
a
day
and
my
brain
goes
"
what
if
this
happens
?"
[sskarz]
yeah
I
get
you
,
it
’
s
hard
to
not
be
thinking
of
those
things
❤
️
this
is
where
that
positive
mentality
stuff
comes
into
play
big
time
lol
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
gonna
keep
that
in
mind
.
[sskarz]
it
really
goes
a
long
way
❤
️
idk
at
least
i
think
it
does
it
helped
me
a
lot
during
my
early
college
years
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
I
am
sure
it
does
,
my
teachers
mention
it
all
the
time
and
I
always
refused
to
believe
that
thinking
positive
will
fix
it
,
but
sometimes
that
helps
a
lot
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
listen
to
your
teachers
,
they
are
right
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
about
like
literally
everything
.
[sskarz]
pessimism
gets
you
nowhere
positive
thinking
at
least
gets
you
a
bit
more
confident
to
do
stuff
again
im
no
psychologist
but
im
just
trying
to
say
something
that
worked
for
me
❤
️
with
that
kind
of
overwhelming
pressure
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
no
psychologist
,
but
you
are
a
teacher
and
I
appreciate
your
positive
and
uplifting
words
and
advice
,
so
once
again
,
thank
you
Mr
.
Thapa
or
Mr
.
Sanskar
.
❤
️
😂
You
must
be
like
such
an
awesome
teacher
when
you
teach
your
students
too
.
[sskarz]
ahaaaaaaaaaa
i
hope
so
😭
[prabipyakurel]
You
[sskarz]
nah
u
giving
me
way
too
much
credit
[prabipyakurel]
But
really
it
takes
skills
to
teach
little
kids
and
you
do
it
as
a
student
[sskarz]
idk
what
to
say
,
im
speechless
lol
thanks
,
means
a
lot
❤
️
i
try
my
best
[prabipyakurel]
That
'
s
the
way
to
go
!
So
what
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
just
talking
with
some
of
my
buds
and
scrolling
through
instagram
👍
they
wanted
to
play
a
drawing
game
and
i
had
to
fight
for
my
life
to
say
no
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
seems
fun
,
you
draw
well
,
the
skribbl
game
that
we
played
,
you
drew
pretty
well
.
[sskarz]
oh

😂
you
don
'
t
have
to
force
the
compliments
💀
💀
i
suckkkkkkkkkkkk
[prabipyakurel]
Nah

was
decent
oh
trust
me
,
I
know
that
feeling
too
well
I

draw
more
than
stick
figures
[sskarz]
you
drew
way
better
than
me
you
'
re
good
💀
[prabipyakurel]
wdym
,
you
thought
the
socks
I
drew
were
air
pods
,
thats
how
badly
it
was
drawn
lol
.
[sskarz]
im
just
dumb
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
,
but
we
can
mutually
agree
that
drawing
is
not
our
thing
.
Well
I
am
about
to
head
to
bed
,
you
have
fun
with
your
friends

few
math
concepts
and
formulas
and
memorize
like

the
27
amendments
.
But
the
weather

depressing
and
too
hot
to

anything
too
energetic
.
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
No
I

Remember
it
filled
up
before
I
could
protect
myself
a
seat
💀
[sskarz]

have
a
memory
of
a
frog
😂
😅
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
no
it
happens
I
was
just
memorizing
it
because
I
was
bored
[sskarz]

started
memorizing
that
because
of
boredom
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
kinda
[sskarz]
damn
you
really
are
a
scholar
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Better
to
do
something
useful
💯
this
is
coming
from
the
dude
who
memorized
the
periodic
table
for
some
extra
credit
[sskarz]
but
it
was
for
extra
credit
💀
my
grade
went
from
a
98
to
a
99
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
wait
for
you
to
experience
dorming
with
someone
❤
️
i
hope
you
tell
me
your
stories
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
I
will
,
depending
on
who
I
am
with
I
am
sure
they
will
be
quite
interesting
And
I
have
the
habit
of
talking
in
my
sleep
too
,
we
shall
see
[sskarz]
at
least
you
'
re
not
grabbing
a
pillow
and
pretending
its
a
guitar
😂
oh
and
try
not
to
hit
yourself
if
you
sleep
walk
lol
[prabipyakurel]
😂
right
I
forgot
about
that
Thanks
for
the
advice
,
my
mom
thinks
I
will
walk
myself
out
of
the
building
and
get
kidnapped
.
💀
Hitting
myself
will
wake
me
up
at
least
[sskarz]
omg
nah
you
'
re
gonna
be
more
than
fine
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
at
most
I
will
fall
down
the
stairs
and
die
before
getting
out
of
the
building
sleepwalking
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
BTW
do
you
play
a
guitar
or
did
you
ever
?
Was
that
guitar
pillow
playing
thing
just
random
?
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
i
thought
i
was
ed
sheeran
with
it
god
no
,
as
a
kid
i
had
no
interest
in
guitars
i
liked
playing
the
drumset
way
more
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
I
remember
when
you
had
a
drumset
in
your
room
the
first
time
we
came
around
,
I
think
.
[sskarz]
yeah
your
brother
really
wanted
to
play
on
it
haha
[prabipyakurel]
You
ever
started
hitting
your
cousin
because
you
thought
you
were
playing
the
drums
?
[sskarz]
you
have
such
good
memory
i
envy
you
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
seems
fun
[sskarz]
omg
i
wish
,
it
would
be
so
funny
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
the
most
useless
things
sometimes
ngl
[sskarz]
my
memory
99
%
of
the
time
i
got
into
drums
after
watching
the
blue
man
group
in
vegas
that
'
s
where
it
all
started
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
What
age
did
you
first
go
to
vegas
?
[sskarz]
my
first
time
was
probably
10
or
12
years
old
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okay
,
not
tooooo
young
to
be
at
vegas
.
But
yea
you
played
the
drums
really
well
from
what
I
remember
.
[sskarz]
thanks
!
definitely
too
young
for
vegas
haha
😂
i
'
d
just
stay
at
the
resorts
and
swim
in
the
lazy
pools
good
times
👍
wbu
?
when
was
your
first
time
in
vegas
?
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
what
we
did
,
I
think
I
was
also
around
like
13
or
14
and
my
brother
was
like
9
and
my
other
cousin
was
also
9
,
and
after
we
all
had
dinner
,
they
put
my
cousisns
grandparents
,
me
and
my
cousins
in
the
hotel
room
and
went
,
"
okay
we
will
be
back
"
We
just
woke
up
next
morning
,
there
was
literally
no
point
in
taking
us
lol
.
Also
got
told
to
get
out
of
most
places
that
we
followed
our
cousins
and
parents
into
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
,
gambling
and
stuff
everywhere
i
'
d
always
get
kicked
out
of
all
the
casinos
haha
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
its
better
to
wait
a
few
years
before
going
there
,
honestly
I
dont
see
a
point
to
go
anytime
soon
.
[sskarz]
there
'
s
no
real
point
to
go
to
vegas
unless
you
got
like
a
show
to
watch
or
you
'
re
over
21
yeah
i
agree
100
%
i
'
m
going
again
this
year
,
and
just
like
last
times
,
gonna
be
staying
at
the
resort
and
doing
nothing
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
with
family
or
like
solo
.
[sskarz]
family
i
kinda
have
to
go
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
I
am
sure
they
wont
kick
you
out
of
the
casino
at
least
you
are
pretty
tall
right
.
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
even
then
,
i
don
'
t
wanna
be
near
casinos
willingly
i
'
m
not
that
big
of
a
fan
of
that
kind
of
social
space
[prabipyakurel]
True
true
,
they
all
stare
at
you
[sskarz]
i
'
d
rather
stay
home
and
enjoy
a
show
alone
than
going
to
vegas
[prabipyakurel]
Too
social
right
there
Sounds
like
me
.
[sskarz]
we
fr
the
same
💀
❤
️
yeah
the
introvert
in
me
could
never
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
when
people
ask
me
if
I
am
an
introvert
I
am
like
well
yes
but
if
I
am
just
around
people
I
like
,
I
can
be
an
extrovert
,
idk
if
you
have
ever
felt
that
way
?
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
100
%
i
have
like
a
social
battery
where
if
im
with
my
friends
or
family
that
i
'
m
familiar
with
i
can
be
very
social
but
every
battery
eventually
runs
out
and
then
i
'
m
just
out
💀
[prabipyakurel]
RIGHT
!!!
Yea
and
be
wierd
all
you
want
,
and
then
there
are
people
that
you
are
with
where
you
are
like
yea
I
dont
have
energy
for
this
.
Hey
but
since
you
are
going
to
vegas
you
should
do
the
zipline
and
skyjump
.
[sskarz]
there
'
s
a
zipline
and
skyjump
????
i
had
no
idea
!
sounds
really
fun
,
have
you
done
it
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
zipline
has
always
been
there
last
time
I
went
everyone
refused
to
go
or
let
me
go
on
it
.
So
,
that
is
something
for
next
time
ig
.
[sskarz]
well
i
'
ll
keep
that
in
mind
for
the
time
i
go
this
year
haha
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[sskarz]
i
just
wish
there
were
things
to
do
there
,
maybe
i
'
ll
be
able
to
just
stay
home
with
bear
and
take
care
of
him
for
a
week
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
right
yea
time
with
that
dog
sounds
nice
.
[sskarz]
better
than
staying
in
a
hotel
while
everyone
else
goes
to
a
casino
lol
the
only
time
i
'
d
willingly
go
to
vegas
is
with
friends
after
im
21
but
till
then
,
nahhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Correct
.
Its
going
to
be
a
while
.
3
years
or
so
You
turning
20
this
year
?
Confused
here
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
you
'
re
18
,
sometimes
i
forget
that
lol
yeah
I
'
m
turning
20
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
thats
cool
,
well
you
just
got
like
a
year
after
october
then
.
[sskarz]
im
not
looking
crazy
forward
towards
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
me
too
,
I
am
still
really
immature
and
childish
[sskarz]
who
wants
to
be
super
mature
in
life
,
its
boring
being
mature
is
good
for
like
serious
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
some
people
out
there
living
the
best
modern
life
and
I
am
like
I
am
happy
with
a
bag
of
chips
and
chocolate
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
REAL
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
just
need
to
be
serious
for
serious
things
only
Have
you
been
in
a
situation
where
you
are
not
supposed
to
laugh
and
you
really
can
'
t
control
it
?
[sskarz]
too
many
times
than
i
can
count
[prabipyakurel]
Like
fr
parents
be
having
the
best
lectures
for
my
brother
sometimes
and
I
am
like
in
the
corner
about
to
burst
out
laughing
.
[sskarz]
hahahaha
i
can
'
t
laugh
to
my
parents
or
the
lecture
continues
💀
learned
that
lesson
way
long
ago
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
then
the
attention
it
towards
you
and
its
your
turn
.
[sskarz]
yup
Homer
disappears
into
a
hedge
when
my
parents
try
to
bring
me
in
the
conversation
when
someone
gets
in
trouble
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
I
am
like
I
am
not
a
part
of
this
.
😂
[sskarz]
you
just
know
its
boutta
be
so
much
worse
when
you
'
re
the
next
target
of
the
lecture
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
'
t
know
if
you
remember
those
nepali
functions
that
used
to
be
held
at
the
park
when
we
were
little
but
when
some
nepali
kid
was
getting
yelled
at
I
am
like
,
lets
not
repeat
that
mistake
in
front
of
my
parents
.
😂
ikr
they
come
for
all
of
us
when
one
makes
the
mistake
[sskarz]
oh
yeahhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
missing
my
childhood
rn
the
days
of
no
responsibilities
this
is
why
i
don
'
t
wanna
be
an
adult
💀
its
just
too
soon
[prabipyakurel]
I
wish
I
was
a
baby
again
just
licking
a
lollipop
[sskarz]
frrrrr
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Like
sitting
exactly
an
inch
in
front
of
the
TV
[sskarz]
and
not
having
to
know
how
to
calculate
theta
from
a
rotating
disc
that
'
s
going
1023990123
mph
the
lifeeeeee
💯
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
probably
some
computer
thing
lol
,
but
yea
life
was
so
simple
back
in
those
days
.
[sskarz]
*
physics
*
made
me
a
different
man
[prabipyakurel]
I
saw
disc
and
I
was
like
nah
something
related
to
computers
💀
Physics
was
never
my
thing
,
I
hated
it
,
all
the
math
included
.
[sskarz]
i
can
relate
so
hard
with
that
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
only
enjoyed
playing
with
wires
and
joining
wires
I
wasnt
supposed
to
.
[sskarz]
the
electrical
engineer
hmmmmmmm
i
could
never
i
'
d
probably
electrocute
myself
knowing
my
brain
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
about
that
too
,
but
If
I
get
electrocuted
oh
well
,
Learned
something
new
before
I
died
.
[sskarz]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
talked
to
u
about
that
being
electrocuted
by
lightning
or
jumping
off
a
cliff
thing
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
The
cliff
one
yes
,
but
lightning
one
no
.
I
mean
I
hope
you
were
alright
,
but
tell
me
lol
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhh
no
no
it
was
like
a
would
you
rather
kind
of
situation
but
you
know
what
,
this
is
perfect
timing
my
friend
just
gave
me
a
situation
and
i
'
m
curious
to
what
your
reaction
is
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
lets
say
you
'
re
transported
3
million
years
into
the
past
.
You
can
only
bring
1
object
and
1
person
with
you
,
and
whatever
is
on
your
body
/
clothes
.
What
are
you
bringing
?
to
survive
obviously
the
object
must
be
from
this
time
(
2023
),
and
the
person
must
be
alive
today
[prabipyakurel]
give
me
a
min
[sskarz]
fs
think
about
it
its
a
hard
question
imo
lol
[prabipyakurel]
wait
I
am
just
living
in
the
past
but
can
bring
one
thing
fom
this
era
right
?
[sskarz]
yes
so
like
a
cell
phone
,
a
flame
thrower
,
etc
[prabipyakurel]
Object
=
Phone
,
person
=
Elon
musk
[sskarz]
oh
what
'
s
your
reasoning
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
phone
is
like
a
necessity
,
you
can
search
for
stuff
and
I
guess
be
able
to
get
more
resources
out
of
it
.
Elon
musk
because
dude
is
Big
brain
and
will
probably
be
easy
to
work
with
to
help
survive
or
improve
and
advance
better
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
you
sure
you
'
re
going
to
have
service
3
million
years
in
the
past
?
[prabipyakurel]
Object
water
Lol
that
was
probably
hard
to
find
[sskarz]
Object
:
Lighter
Person
:
My
dad
either
my
dad
or
bear
grylls
lol
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lighter
is
pretty
clever
,
and
your
dad
is
smart
,
great
choices
.
[sskarz]
i
chose
my
dad
so
i
wouldn
'
t
get
lonely
or
go
insane
lol
plus
he
'
s
pretty
resourceful
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
,
yea
a
familiar
face
might
be
better
.
[sskarz]
and
the
lighter
because
fire
is
enough
to
scare
away
most
predators
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
good
survival
instincts
,
I
would
have
died
with
the
dumb
cellphone
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
you
just
didn
'
t
think
about
it
for
too
long
💀
i
sat
and
talked
to
my
friend
about
it
for
like
30
minutes
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
can
be
that
too
lol
Wow
30
min
,
what
an
intellectual
conversation
that
must
have
been
.
[sskarz]
oh
god
no
we
started
derailing
quickly
we
started
deconstructing
the
definition
of
an
object
to
squeeze
out
the
most
insane
things
to
bring
ultimately
,
my
friend
chose
a
planet
the
size
of
mars
to
implode
and
he
worked
his
way
to
define
it
as
an
"
object
"
it
was
most
certaintly
not
an
intellectual
conversation
,
more
so
how
much
can
you
get
away
with
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
him
he
will
be
the
next
Elon
musk
😂
💀
[sskarz]
elon
musk
is
a
smart
business
man
,
idk
how
he
would
do
in
a
scenario
being
in
the
past
tho
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
yea
there
is
that
but
he
is
like
always
coming
up
with
crazy
inventions
and
ways
to
advance
the
world
[sskarz]
true
idk
i
'
m
on
the
fence
with
that
guy
i
appreciate
his
efforts
towards
a
better
future
for
the
human
race
,
at
the
same
time
he
has
some
nasty
practices
that
i
can
'
t
support
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
have
heard
things
about
the
dude
too
.
[sskarz]
like
he
directly
receives
materials
to
build
his
cars
and
products
from
mines
worked
by
children
and
stuff
which
isn
'
t
like
directly
his
fault
but
supporting
that
kind
of
stuff
idk
also
just
some
questionable
decisions
on
the
business
side
of
things
,
and
his
political
views
that
i
don
'
t
agree
with
[prabipyakurel]
True
true
,
some
people
dont
care
about
the
process
as
long
as
they
are
successful
too
.
👍
Yea
for
sure
[sskarz]
i
mean
at
least
he
'
s
better
than
bezos
💀
that
guy
is
a
whole
other
entire

how
his
company
works
with
his
employees
working
god
awful
conditions
and
not
giving
proper
pay
/
time
off
also
he
has
a
lot
of
bad
relationship
issues
one
of
the
worst
CEOs
for
sure
also
very
egotistical
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
I
never
knew
this
[sskarz]
anywho
,
in
short
not
a
lot
of
good
billionairs
out

[prabipyakurel]

s

[prabipyakurel]
😂
What
are
your
thoughts
on
pink
lemonade
?
[sskarz]
my
literal
go
to
drink
to
any
restaraunt
its
just
lemonade
or
a
variation
of
lemonade
[prabipyakurel]
Lemonade
is
just
simple
and
great
[sskarz]
like
the
strawberry
acai
from
starbucks
used
to
be
my
favorite
drink
there
and
its
available
everywhere
,
best
part
lol
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Should
probably
try
that
,
I
have
tried
the
pink
drink
and
it
’
s
okay
.
Starbucks
is
the
most
beautiful
place
that
could
exist
.
😂
[sskarz]
the
pink
drink
i
think
is
with
coconut
milk
which
is
why
it
doesn
'
t
really
taste
like
lemonade
what
'
s
your
go
to
drink
there
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
isn
’
t
too
great
but
not
bad
.
Caramel
crunch
Frappuccino
I
have
tried
some
white
chocolate
one
too
and
it
wasn
’
t
too
bad
.
[sskarz]
oh
that
sounds
so
good
,
remind
me
to
try
it
tomorrow
haha
like
the
white
chocolate
mocha
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
remind
you
on
Wednesday
or
Tuesday
?
[sskarz]
........
i
forgot
💀
💀
its
already
tuesday
lmaoooooo
yeah
today
technically
haha
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
that
is
what
I
tried
[sskarz]
yeah
i
think
the
white
chocolate
mocha
is
alright
,
nothing
too
crazy
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Sure
i
will
remind
you
,
it
’
s
really
good
❤
️
[sskarz]
do
you
add
anything
to
it
or
just
the
base
version
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
just
how
it
comes
I
am
not
picky
with
the
barista
Though
almost
every
time
I
go
I
get
a
new
name
[sskarz]
oh
that
couldn
'
t
be
me
💀
💀
[prabipyakurel]
They
can
’
t
catch
my
name
[sskarz]
do
u
wanna
see
my
go
to
?
[prabipyakurel]
Let
’
s
see
it
[sskarz]
this
right
here
is
like
crack
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
those
little
things
on
the
bottom
[sskarz]
i
used
to
go
so
often
during
last
semester
that
they
started
to
recognize
me
by
my
order
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
you
told
me
to
get
this
for
you
I
am
just
telling
them
the
size
and
the
ones
in
bold
print
.
[sskarz]
LOL
i
don
'
t
blame
you
at
all
😂
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
like
oh
it
’
s
him
,
get
ready
.
💀
[sskarz]
i
only
order
that
online
,
having
to
explain
all
of
it
in
person
is
not
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
okay
okay
[sskarz]
if
not
that
order
,
i
go
with
the
matcha
tea
latte
with
cold
foam
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Matcha
is
alright
Not
a
big
fan
of
it
Just
the
flavor
matcha
on
anything
[sskarz]
ahhh
i
see
im
guessing
that
extends
to
green
tea
as
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
green
tea
I
don
’
t
know
,
it
tastes
off
for
me
.
I
am
just
a
lemon
tea
or
Indian
tea
type
of
person
for
tea
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fair
lol
👍

starbucks

Pretty

yep
[sskarz]
its
nice
and
simple
compared
to
some
other
infrastructures
[prabipyakurel]
ikr

its
not
hard
to
use
either
,
simple
to
see
grades
and
easy
quiz
format
too
.
The
only
class
I

lol
👍
Wyd

[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
finished
all
10
modules
of
the
prep
course
,
and
just
finished
playing
a
game
of
battleship
with
my
brother
,
and
now
I
am
either
going
to
sit
bored
or
make
something
.
[sskarz]
:
O
I
haven
’
t
heard
of
that
game
in
years
!
did
u
beat
him
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
he
sunk
all
5
of
my
ships
before
I
did
his
.
Pretty
depressing
,
but
we
played
that
after
like
2
years
and
it
was
fun
.
[sskarz]
RIP
get
a
rematch
haha
got
some
childhood
memories
flooding
back
from
hearing
about
that
game
just
now
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
will
dont
worry
,
I
always
do
.
💯
[sskarz]
BEAT
HIM
UPPPPPPPPPPP
jk
jk
jk
do
you
get
competitive
with
your
brother
on
games
like
these
?
[prabipyakurel]
😂
Well
next
time
you
come
,
you
can
play
and
relive
those
memories
.
Not
too
competitive
,
but
a
good
amount
.
[sskarz]
bet
,
best
of
3
me
against
you
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[sskarz]
i
ask
because
my
sister
and
i
have
a
deathly
rivalry
when
we
play
connect
4
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
some
games
be
like
that
though
.
Like
it
feels
soooo
good
rubbing
the
celebration
of
defeat
on
someone
younger
than
you
.
💀
Yea
I
think
a
lot
of
older
siblings
do
that
.
[sskarz]
hahaha
couldn
'
t
be
me
,
im
the
youngest
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
dont
even
understand
how
good
that
feels
.
Its
like
something
you
can
brag
about
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
mention
their
failure
at
random
times
.
💀
[sskarz]
you
'
re
an
actual
menace
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
sister
be
doing
that
too
lmao
😂
my
rule
is
i
can
'
t
stop
until
i
end
on
a
win
so
then
i
can
always
get
back
at
them
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
and
especially
if
I
beat
someone
in
a
game
and
I
don
'
t
know
how
to
play
that
game
well
,
That
is
the
last
time
I
am
playing
against
that
person
.
I
shall
forever
remain
the
winner
.
😂
[sskarz]
Great
minds
think
Alike
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
think
about
that
too
,
oooo
when
I
beat
someone
I
am
like
"
we
are
not
doing
any
type
of
rematch
!"
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
especially
if
they
'
re
better
than
me
at
that
thing
like
i
have
a
friend
that
is
insanely
good
at
this
game
,
and
i
can
never
win
against
him
for
the
life
of
me
but
i
did
squeeze
out
a
win
when
he
handicapped
himself
💀
and
that
was
the
last
time
i
went
against
him
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
like
if
I
went
up
against
you
at
chess
or
something
and
by
some
miracle
I
beat
you
,
that
is
it
,
we
are
not
touching
chess
again
lol
.
[sskarz]
so
i
just
gotta
keep
winning
so
we
can
keep
playing
*
takes
notes
*
[prabipyakurel]
Correct
.
[sskarz]
im
super
washed
up
at
chess
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Which
game
was
it
that
you
beat
your
friend
in
?
[sskarz]
i
haven
'
t
played
in
a
while
,
all
that
knowledge
is
just
out
the
window
its
a
video
game
you
'
ve
probably
never
heard
of
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
but
you
have
been
good
at
it
,
you
won
'
t
forget
too
easily
.
Oh
video
game
,
i
probably
never
heard
of
.
Do
you
play
wordle
?
[sskarz]
yeah
!
i
had
a
tradition
with
my
friend
that
at
the
start
of
class
while
everyone
is
setting
up
,
we
'
d
compete
and
see
who
can
do
the
wordle
the
fastest
we
'
d
be
like
5
minutes
early
and
just
blitz
through
it
we
did
it
for
like
a
semester
straight
have
you
done
the
wordle
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
I
used
to
do
the
same
with
my
friends
.
And
i
had
this
one
friend
that
would
wait
till
someone
got
to
keep
his
streak
on
getting
it
on
the
first
try
.
Yep
,
u
?
[sskarz]
so
they
could
get
it
right
?
nah
im
doing
it
rn
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wait
no
i
havent
done
todays
,
that
was
yesterday
lets
see
who
gets
it
[sskarz]
bet
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
this
word
is
hard
💀
im
close
tho
did
u
get
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
On
the
last
one
welp
I
didn
'
t
get
it
.
[sskarz]
rip
im
still
thinking
hold
on
im
on
my
5th
guess
this
is
what
i
have
so
far
[prabipyakurel]
Those
word
choices
though
[sskarz]
wait
wah
i
just
guess
canoe
first
because
it
covers
most
vowels
and
then
fight
to
get
rid
of
common
consonants
[prabipyakurel]
Smart
smart
[sskarz]
usually
gives
me
a
good
direction
to
what
the
word
is
👍
im
so
lost
this
word
makes
no
sense
to
me
will
keep
trying
tho
wait
i
got
it
idk
how
that
didn
'
t
click
sooner
what
were
your
guesses
?
[prabipyakurel]
Good
job
[sskarz]
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
THAT
LAST
GUESS
😭
[prabipyakurel]
This
annoys
me
so
much
[sskarz]
you
had
a
1
in
2
chance
rip
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
That
was
fun
though
!
[sskarz]
i
haven
'
t
done
that
in
so
long
lol
did
u
know
there
'
s
also
a
chessle
the
wordle
version
of
chess
[prabipyakurel]
OOO
interesting
[sskarz]
and
there
is
a
really
cool
version
called
mathle
i
think
its
like
you
have
to
guess
the
equation
and
output
requires
a
lot
of
thought
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
I
know
what
that
game
is
,
my
friend
tony
would
open
it
up
,
look
at
me
knowing
I
didn
'
t
know
how
to
play
,
and
went
you
wanna
try
.
[sskarz]
you
have
the
most
thought
out
of
the
both
of
us
you
got
this
👍
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
that
is
literally
you
,
you
should
see
some
dumb
moves
I
make
when
playing
games
.
[sskarz]
but
that
'
s
with
games
that
'
s
like
nothing
💀
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
no
brain
cells
and
don
'
t
know
what
I
did
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
,
i
should
'
ve
mentioned
its
based
on
'
openings
'
in
chess
the
first
few
moves
in
a
chess
game
always
have
some
kind
of
name
and
you
have
to
guess
the
first
few
moves
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
I
will
not
go
back
to
try
that
,
I
am
going
to
stick
to
playing
SODOKU
.
😂
[sskarz]
i
still
don
'
t
know
how
to
play
sudoku
it
looks
so
complicated
the
numbers
be
scaring
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
its
simple
[sskarz]
its
like
adding
numbers
or
something
like
that
i
have
no
idea
[prabipyakurel]
Um
so
basically
you
have
a
grid
where
you
need
to
put
numbers
from
1
-
9
vertically
and
horizontally
,
but
cant
put
the
same
number
if
it
has
already
been
in
that
row
.
Like
here
there
are
9
boxes
and
within
each
boxes
,
each
number
is
only
there
once
.
And
if
you
see
the
vertical
and
horizontal
rows
all
of
them
range
from
1
-
9
but
dont
repeat
numbers
in
the
same
row
.
[sskarz]
does
it
only
apply
for
the
3x3
boxes
or
the
entire
9x9
box
[prabipyakurel]
3x3
You
can
try
it
on
the
app
,
I
learned
red
it
that
way
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
ok
that
is
acutally
simpler
than
what
i
thought
it
was
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
you
must
be
a
pro
at
it
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
worry
If
I
can
play
,
you
can
master
it
.
No
just
play
for
fun
,
it
makes
you
think
sometimes
.
[sskarz]
gotta
flex
that
brain
fr
[prabipyakurel]
lol
imagine
going
up
to
someone
and
going
hi
nice
to
meet
you
I
play
SODOKU
for
fun
,
I
swear
that
person
is
gonna
walk
in
the
opposite
direction
.
[sskarz]
hey
i
think
its
pretty
cool
that
you
play
sudoku
❤
️
if
you
like
doing
it
,
then
that
'
s
awesome
pretty
much
my
outlook
on
that
kind
of
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
means
a
lot
.
[sskarz]
yeah
of
course
👍
i
don
'
t
diss
on
people
'
s
hobbies
,
like
if
you
like
doing
something
,
as
long
as
its
not
illegal
or
ethically
/
morally
wrong
,
then
that
'
s
all
good
lol
what
do
you
think
?
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
yes
I
couldn
'
t
have
agreed
with
you
more
,
I
respect
people
for
the
talent
they
have
,
I
believe
that
no
talent
is
too
small
.
However
,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
world
that
make
fun
of
people
for
some
hobbies
and
I
personally
don
'
t
like
those
people
.
❤
️
I
mean
they
worked
hard
on
getting
to
a
certain
point
and
who
are
we
to
judge
them
.
[sskarz]
exactly
👍
hobbies
define
what
people
enjoy
and
that
'
s
what
makes
us
unique
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
its
like
how
you
play
the
drums
and
chess
and
it
is
something
that
you
enjoy
.
I
respect
you
for
that
,
don
'
t
ever
listen
to
what
anyone
else
says
,
someone
always
has
something
negative
to
say
in
my
opinion
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
oh
dw
,
plenty
of
people
be
saying
negative
stuff
behind
your
back
,
but
never
take
mind
to
what
they
say
❤
️
if
you
enjoy
what
you
do
and
its
what
makes
you
you
,
then
who
'
s
to
say
what
makes
you
as
a
person
right
i
mean
this
as
in
a
general
sense
,
not
literally
just
to
be
clear
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
understand
.
[sskarz]
yeah
those
that
diss
your
hobbies
,
get
em
out
they
'
re
weird
to
be
dissing
someone
based
off
what
they
like
doing
💯
[prabipyakurel]
For
real
some
people
out
there
with
no
talent
be
hating
on
other
people
'
s
ability
.
[sskarz]
they
just
mad
they
don
'
t
have
their
own
[prabipyakurel]
lol
true
true
[sskarz]
anyway
,
did
you
get
that
rematch
with
your
brother
?
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
,
not
today
,
he
isnt
up
for
it
,
I
will
get
it
though
!
[sskarz]
aw
damn
,
you
'
ll
get
him
next
time
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
been
meaning
to
play
some
online
chess
with
him
,
gonna
message
him
later
i
love
his
enthusiasm
for
that
game
and
i
would
like
for
him
to
keep
going
into
high
school
with
that
fire
🔥
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
he
likes
playing
chess
too
,
yea
you
should
play
with
him
,
he
would
love
to
play
with
someone
on
the
same
skill
set
.
[sskarz]
oho
?
he
'
s
on
my
skill
set
now
?
jk
jk
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
mean
someone
better
than
me
at
least
,
nah
he
is
probably
not
at
your
level
yet
lol
[sskarz]
not
yet
but
he
could
easily
surpass
,
he
'
s
got
a
great
mindset
❤
️
i
hope
he
joins
a
chess
club
or
makes
one
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
one
in
SG
so
if
he
goes
there
I
will
tell
him
to
join
.
[sskarz]
is
that
where
he
plans
to
attend
for
high
school
?
[prabipyakurel]
At
the
moment
yes
,
but
if
addresses
and
stuff
dont
work
out
then
it
might
be
mountain
view
.
[sskarz]
as
long
as
you
have
someone
living
in
that
area
,
you
should
be
fine
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
.
[sskarz]
or
get
one
of
those
approval
things
i
forget
how
those
work
but
yeah
,
he
should
be
fine
👍
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
,
hopefully
you
enjoyed
that
starbucks
drink
but
for
right
now
,
imma
go
make
some
food
and
take
a
shower
.
I
will
talk
you
later
.
[sskarz]
gotcha
,
I
'
ll
talk
to
you
later
!
bai
bai
👋
👋
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
Hey
,
good
afternoon
!
How
is
your
day
going
so
far
?
[sskarz]
hey
!
sorry
I
took
a
really
long
nap
and
I
just
woke
up
,
day
'
s
been
pretty
chill
so
far
how
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
no
worries
,
glad
you
slept
well
.
I
have
been
completing
some
videos
I
need
to
watch
before
starting
to
dorm
,
so
just
doing
that
and
getting
it
out
of
the
way
.
You
doing
anything
right
now
?
[sskarz]
Oh
nice
!
The
day
creeps
closer
and
closer
lol
I
’
m
just
in
bed
watching
TikTok
’
s
,
I
feel
so
lazy
👍
I
have
stuff
to
do
but
I
just
am
not
in
the
mood
to
do
them
lol
wbu
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
that
happens
so
many
times
,
when
you
have
stuff
to
do
but
decide
not
to
do
them
.
Teaching
brother
to
make
chowmein
They
are
fr
giving
me
a
lesson
on
alcohol
measurements
and
I
am
like
18
.
Dying
right
now
.
[sskarz]
💀
💀
That
’
s
actually
hilarious
Oooooh
hope
he
does
well
it
really
be
one
of
those
days
😂
To
be
honest
,
I
didn
’
t
know
this
stuff
Not
like
the
specifics
[prabipyakurel]
Looking
pretty
good
,
we
are
going
to
try
it
later
with
our
parents
.
[sskarz]
He
’
s
got
it
for
sure
👍
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
am
not
paying
attention
,
I
am
picking
whatever
to
finish
this
thing
[sskarz]
that
’
s
an
honest
mood
[prabipyakurel]
Its
like
online
classes
all
over
again
just
play
the
video
on
a
split
screen
and
do
my
thing
on
the
other
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
they
make
us
do
those
things
like
every
semester
At
this
point
I
’
ve
just
memorized
all
the
answers
from
the
previous
times
I
’
ve
taken
them
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
yea
sometimes
some
things
seem
like
they
are
on
repeat
and
you
know
what
will
happen
next
everytime
.
[sskarz]
the
definition
of
a
pattern
😂
[prabipyakurel]
right
[sskarz]
You
feeling
anymore
ready
for
the
big
move
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
still
taking
time
to
process
that
its
actually
going
to
happen
omg
imagine
I
die
tomorrow
and
it
doesnt
end
up
happening
[sskarz]
please
don
’
t
think
that
❤
️
That
’
s
not
healthy
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
ik
ik
,
but
sometimes
I
can
convince
myself
that
its
in
the
same
state
,
nothing
too
big
,
and
sometimes
my
brain
is
like
you
are
not
going
to
survive
there
alone
.
[sskarz]
You
got
the
angel
and
devil
on
the
shoulder
kind
of
situation
[prabipyakurel]
fr
[sskarz]
you
know
realistically
I
think
it
may
take
some
time
for
you
to
adjust
to
the
new
lifestyle
but
everyone
eventually
does
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
once
I
get
there
,
I
will
understand
that
its
not
as
bad
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
just
homesickness
I
think
is
what
might
be
difficult
,
how
far
is
Berkeley
from
here
?
[prabipyakurel]
7
hours
,
on
drive
.
[sskarz]
Oh
jeez
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
That
’
s
like
San
Francisco
drive
that
’
s
nuts
I
never
thought
it
was
that
far
[prabipyakurel]
Berkleley
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
oakland
side
bridge
.
[sskarz]
Ohhhhh
North
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
While
San
Francisco
is
on
the
opposite
.
I
think
so
,
yes
!
[sskarz]
I
see
Dang
that
drive
is
gonna
feel
like
a
slog
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Are
you
motion
sick
like
in
long
drives
or
on
planes
?
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
,
we
are
going
to
SF
saturday
to
check
out
the
school
and
with
this
weather
,
I
can
already
imagine
the
car
ride
there
.
Not
planes
,
havent
been
on
too
many
plane
rides
to
feel
those
,
but
car
rides
,
when
I
was
little
I
could
not
be
in
a
car
or
a
bus
,
like
I
felt
sick
and
threw
up
instantly
.
When
I
was
in
Nepal
and
we
needed
to
go
somewhere
on
taxi
or
bus
,
I
needed
medication
to
not
throw
up
.
Not
as
bad
now
,
but
sometimes
it
still
feels
bad
on
long
drives
.
[sskarz]
Oh
I
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
definitely
keep
some
of
that
medication
on
hand
Me
not
so
much
It
depends
on
who
’
s
driving
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
dont
use
it
anymore
,
but
I
just
fall
asleep
if
I
feel
sick
.
[sskarz]
If
the
driver
does
sharp
breaks
or
like
sharp
turns
every
time
then
I
get
sick
very
easily
But
if
they
drive
relatively
normal
and
smooth
,
it
’
s
no
problem
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
those
are
terrible
especially
on
curvy
roads
.
Yea
its
easier
to
be
with
someone
who
drives
smooth
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
you
know
how
some
people
only
break
right
before
they
hit
the
car
in
front
Instead
of
rolling
it
to
a
stop
Those
people
make
me
sick
so
easily
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
always
avoid
those
,
I
am
a
new
driver
and
stop
very
slowly
and
far
away
,
like
to
the
point
where
my
dad
shakes
his
head
and
goes
,
"
an
entire
car
can
fit
in
the
space
"
😂
[sskarz]
Hahahaha
I
get
that
I
used
to
do
the
same
but
I
’
ve
gotten
a
lot
more
confident
over
the
years
How
long
have
you
had
your
license
for
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
got
it
on
halloween
last
year
,
I
specifically
remember
because
I
told
my
instructor
,
"
thank
you
,
and
happy
halloween
"
💀
Yea
hopefully
I
get
used
to
driving
a
little
more
normally
.
[sskarz]
Please
tell
me
you
did
the
test
with
a
costume
on
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
to
nervous
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
,
I
forgot
it
was
Halloween
midway
through
the
test
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
would
’
ve
been
so
funny
Was
your
instructor
nice
?
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
yes
he
was
actually
and
I
remember
I
did
this
turn
a
bit
too
fast
and
his
phone
fell
into
that
little
space
behind
the
seat
belt
buckle
area
and
I
was
like
"
oh
no
,
this
is
it
,
I
am
done
!"
I
kept
saying
sorry
and
he
was
like
no
worries
,
keep
going
.
He
eventually
got
it
out
in
a
while
and
was
not
too
mad
about
it
.
OOOO
the
first
instructor
that
I
had
he
was
all
grumpy
and
scary
and
was
kind
of
mean
.
I
also
forgot
a
speed
bump
and
that
was
my
first
mistake
with
him
,
he
gave
up
after
I
have
more
than
15
mistakes
.
[sskarz]
Ohhhhh
damn
💀
Hahaha
you
hit
the
swerve
a
little
too
hard
😂
do
you
drive
with
both
hands
on
the
wheel
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
Do
you
?
Or
are
you
those
that
put
one
hand
down
,
and
only
use
one
to
drive
.
[sskarz]
Yep
that
’
s
me
My
arms
are
pretty
long
so
having
both
out
on
a
hinge
tires
my
arms
out
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
lol
it
scares
me
when
someone
drives
like
that
,
honestly
wish
I
had
it
in
me
to
do
that
but
there
is
time
.
Right
,
I
am
tiny
and
have
short
arms
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
everyone
gets
to
that
point
👍
Well
you
can
just
put
the
seat
up
further
and
achieve
the
same
effect
,
I
have
my
left
arm
driving
at
7
or
8
position
usually
Not
professional
advice
btw
💀
😂
It
’
s
most
definitely
better
to
have
both
hands
on
the
wheel
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
with
how
much
my
seat
already
had
to
move
forward
,
I
really
cannot
move
it
any
closer
to
the
wheel
.
😂
[sskarz]
Now
I
really
wanna
see
you
drive
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
should
be
in
a
car
with
me
,
you
will
be
in
the
back
and
will
have
to
like
pull
yourself
forward
to
talk
to
me
face
to
face
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
so
that
’
s
something
I
definitely
need
to
see
haha
I
usually
have
my
seat
leaned
to
the
max
setting
so
I
wonder
what
that
would
look
like
[prabipyakurel]
Someday
,
not
anytime
soon
,
but
someday
we
can
go
on
a
short
drive
.
❤
️
Oh
my
god
its
like
the
opposite
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
being
5
’
10
”
has
its
nuances
I
still
look
short
in
the
seat
tho
,
my
legs
are
just
too
long
😂
[prabipyakurel]
One
more
inch
and
you
will
officially
be
a
feet
taller
than
me
.
[sskarz]
My
genetics
going
on
overdrive
rn
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[sskarz]
Maybe
I
just
need
to
drink
more
milk
🤔
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
what
all
nepali
mothers
say
,
never
worked
for
me
though
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
actually
just
a
straight
up
lie
lol
Bone
density
doesn
’
t
have
anything
to
do
with
increasing
your
height
Unless
you
cut
open
your
leg
and
put
metal
rods
between
your
bones
and
extend
that
length
Which
I
still
can
’
t
wrap
my
head
around
why
someone
would
want
to
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
Why
would
anyone
want
to
do
that
?
lol
here
is
a
picture
of
me
standing
with
my
friend
that
is
6
feet
,
and
we
used
to
be
the
same
height
in
middle
school
.
It
is
sad
lmao
.😂
😂
[sskarz]
You
look
drunk
💀
Hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Nahhhh
dont
look
at
me
Picture
was
taken
weirdly
,
I
was
turning
around
[sskarz]
It
’
s
pretty
funny
But
it
do
be
like
that
I
had
a
friend
I
was
taller
than
in
middle
school
and
now
he
’
s
like
6
’
3
”
Like
a
damn
giant
[prabipyakurel]
yea
anyone
above
six
,
I
wont
even
try
looking
at
them
.
exaclty
every
other
person
I
meet
.
😂
[sskarz]
U
can
get
those
like
ultra
length
shoes
where
they
just
stack
crazy
amounts
of
height
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
When
the
sky
falls
you
’
ll
be
one
of
the
last
ones
fr
[prabipyakurel]
gonna
start
wearing
these
.
💀
[sskarz]
The
next
big
purchase
boutta
be
a
life
changer
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
[sskarz]
😂
It
just
reminds
me
of
this
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
aot
any
friends
that
are
like
wayyyyyyy
shorter
than
you
.
like
you
look
down
on
them
literally
?
[sskarz]
🫵
😂
JK
JK
JK
uh
Yeah
I
actually
do
I
have
a
friend
that
’
s
actually
4
’
9
”
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okay
okay
,
wow
4
"
9
[sskarz]
Yep
She
’
s
like
you
but
she
’
s
feisty
😂
She
snaps
back
so
fast
if
you
even
mention
her
height
💀
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
a
very
relatable
feeling
Feels
good
to
get
back
at
the
other
person
sometimes
[sskarz]
Yeah
sometimes
she
reminds
me
of
an
angry
chihuahua
the
way
she
talks
shit
💀
She
’
s
funny
tho
I
’
ll
give
her
that
But
that
’
s
about
it
for
my
short
friends
👍
[prabipyakurel]
An
angry
chihuahua
😭😂
[sskarz]
If
you
ever
met
her
you
would
instantly
understand
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
love
meeting
someone
the
same
height
as
me
and
talking
about
those
other
tall
people
[sskarz]
“
The
giants
that
roam
amongst
us
”
I
wish
you
watched
attack
on
titan
,
you
would
get
that
reference
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
god
,
my
brother
would
watch
that
soo
much
,
a
lot
of
my
friends
and
one
of
my
teachers
too
,
she
was
giving
away
attack
on
titan
posters
to
anyone
that
wanted
one
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
a
great
show
,
some
of
the
best
story
telling
of
our
generation
probably
the
most
popular
anime
in
the
entire
world
[prabipyakurel]
this
thing
right
?
Yea
I
have
heard
.
Thats
how
I
be
seeing
everyone
around
me
ngl
.
💀
[sskarz]
That
is
one
of
the
titans
yes
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
I
think
that
there
are
also
red
ones
if
I
am
not
wrong
.
[sskarz]
Uhhhhhh
technically
You
’
d
just
have
to
watch
to
understand
but
it
is
an
anime
soooooo
idk
if
you
will
lol
it
do
be
peak
story
telling
tho
I
’
ll
say
that
much
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
anime
,
if
,
then
maybe
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
so
I
’
ll
take
that
as
a
never
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Kind
of
I
will
read
a
description
of
the
thing
though
[sskarz]
The
story
is
ending
this
year
I
believe
ironically
👍
[prabipyakurel]
okay
did
it
[sskarz]
After
like
a
decade
of
airing
it
Only
like
4
seasons
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
people
talka
about
it
a
lot
,
seems
to
be
watched
by
many
.
[sskarz]
Yep
For
good
reason
I
’
d
say
That
’
s
the
first
episode
in
a
nutshell
[prabipyakurel]
Plot
seems
pretty
interesting
,
It
would
be
nice
if
they
made
an
actual
show
with
people
.
Damn
[sskarz]
Trust
me
this
can
only
work
in
animation
Again
a
very
good
reason
behind
that
as
well
lol
[prabipyakurel]
oh
I
see
but
yea
after
a
year
of
my
friends
using
random
memes
from
this
anime
,
I
got
to
know
that
it
was
called
attack
on
titans
.
[sskarz]
Well
at
least
you
got
the
name
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
,
something
is
better
than
nothing
lol
[sskarz]
ok
but
do
you
just
not
like
anime
,
or
all
animation
in
general
?
Just
curious
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
maybe
animation
in
general
Or
just
the
concepts
of
anime
But
even
when
I
tried
watching
the
1st
episode
of
nauto
with
my
brother
,
I
just
kinda
tuned
out
.
[sskarz]
Naruto
is
uh
kinda
mid
im
ngl
I
loved
it
as
a
kid
but
when
I
look
back
at
it
It
was
good
just
not
like
the
greatest
like
people
say
it
is
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
show
seems
kind
weird
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
not
that
it
’
s
weird
,
it
just
take
a
while
for
it
to
really
go
Idk
tho
u
might
think
the
premise
of
the
show
is
weird
which
I
can
understand
where
you
’
re
coming
from
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
maybe
,
or
maybe
its
because
I
don
'
t
give
my
time
to
understand
an
amine
and
when
I
watch
the
first
episode
and
am
not
interested
,
I
assume
I
will
not
be
interested
through
out
the
rest
of
the
episodes
.
[sskarz]
That
’
s
fair
lol
I
do
the
same
with
like
every
show
👍
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
was
randomly
looking
through
insta
and
saw
this
,
I
need
to
save
this
in
case
I
come
across
a
bug
in
my
dorm
.
😂
[sskarz]
I
can
already
see
you
typing
out
this
email
in
the
future
💀
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
[sskarz]
At
least
being
some
form
of
bug
spray
And
a
gas
mask
[prabipyakurel]
Not
gonna
help
trust
me
,
I
am
jumping
out
the
window
.
[sskarz]
that
way
you
do
have
a
way
to
defend
yourself
💀
I
pray
your
dorm
mate
is
brave
enough
then
haha
🙏
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
praying
too
lol
or
someone
down
the
hallway
that
can
get
it
out
for
me
.
[sskarz]
does
the
fear
of
bugs
also
extend
to
like
those
kids
shows
where
the
main
character
is
like
a
bug
[prabipyakurel]
Uh
nah
not
cartoons
,
spiders
are
still
an
issue
but
other
bugs
are
fine
[sskarz]
Ohhh
ok
so
like
charlottes
web
is
a
no
go
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
Like
no
no
[sskarz]
aww
damn
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Like
spiders
are
like
a
no
no
forever
I
dont
even
care
if
its
dead
dead
,
I
am
not
going
to
be
anywhere
near
it
[sskarz]
If
you
were
asked
to
defeat
a
spider
with
nothing
but
your
hands
for
a
chance
of
1
trillion
dollars
Would
you
do
it
[prabipyakurel]
No
Never
u
?
[sskarz]
ofc
easiest
trillion
dollars
ever
lol
For
me
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
like
how
do
you
see
it
and
not
scream
like
it
has
8
legs
and
crawls
[sskarz]
it
’
s
a
tiny
spider
thing
Top
of
the
food
chain
[prabipyakurel]
Like
one
of
those
that
are
the
size
of
a
pushpin
,
that
is
enough
to
get
me
out
of
the
room
[sskarz]
Or
I
just
vacuum
then
and
they
just
get
squished
[prabipyakurel]
Can
do
that
either
I
would
literally
cry
in
a
corner
and
wait
for
someone
to
come
get
it
out
[sskarz]
Dang
you
have
pretty
crazy
arachnophobia
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
pretty
bad
[sskarz]
That
’
s
me
but
like
claustrophobia
I
can
’
t
stand
small
spaces
[prabipyakurel]
Like
not
even
for
a
small
while
what
if
you
are
playing
hide
and
seek
[sskarz]
No
I
can
but
man
I
really
don
’
t
like
it
My
go
to
is
usually
just
under
something
like
a
blanket
or
idk
can
’
t
hide
in
the
fridge
anymore
😂
[prabipyakurel]
aha
loser
,
tall
people
issues
😂
Mines
are
like
cabinets
or
under
the
bed
type
of
thing
[sskarz]
You
can
fit
in
cabinets
???
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
that
’
s
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Once
I
check
for
bugs
and
remove
the
stuff
[sskarz]
Ah
of
course
[prabipyakurel]
There
you
go
[sskarz]
I
’
m
ngl
This
might
be
one
of
the
quickest
days
I
’
ve
ever
experienced
I
can
’
t
believe
it
’
s
already
8
pm
My
mind
is
boggled
[prabipyakurel]
Some
days
are
like
this
[sskarz]
Can
’
t
do
this
again
💀
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
time
flies
by
fast
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
are
motivated
to
do
other
things
.
Like
this
one
time
I
had
math
homework
and
a
presentation
over
the
weekend
and
I
just
didn
'
t
have
it
in
me
to
start
on
math
,
and
I
looove
presentations
and
putting
slides
together
,
so
I
went
with
that
and
finished
like
10
-
15
slides
that
day
.
And
time
flew
by
fast
too
.
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
today
i
just
didn
'
t
want
to
do
anything
at
all
haven
'
t
felt
like
that
in
a
while
it
be
like
that
sometimes
i
guess
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
its
summer
too
,
so
some
days
are
like
dead
slow
and
other
days
are
like
what
did
I
even
do
today
?
[sskarz]
yep
you
get
it
👍
[prabipyakurel]
When
I
used
to
be
bored
sometimes
I
used
to
make
like
bracelets
with
crochets
,
I
dont
know
if
you
have
.
Miss
those
days
,
I
was
gonna
do
it
today
,
but
I
just
ended
up
not
doing
it
.
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
never
tried
making
a
bracelet
with
crochet
sounds
pretty
cool
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
pattern
is
pretty
fun
.
[sskarz]
when
did
you
learn
to
make
them
?
[prabipyakurel]
like
these
,
I
forgot
what
they
were
called
.
I
learned
them
at
my
elementary
school
'
s
afterschool
program
.
Then
got
one
of
my
own
little
mushrooms
and
hooks
and
tried
it
.
[sskarz]
oooooooh
that
looks
neat
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
only
know
one
pattern
but
it
takes
away
stress
sometimes
.
But
I
do
not
know
how
to
like
crochet
big
things
or
knit
like
that
.
[sskarz]
i
always
thought
knitting
was
complicated
looks
like
you
can
mess
up
so
easily
without
focus
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
makes
my
brain
hurt
too
,
the
mushroom
is
easy
tho
I
was
able
to
do
it
as
a
child
so
its
pretty
simple
.
[sskarz]
nice
!
well
I
'
m
about
to
go
head
out
for
dinner
and
head
to
bed
right
after
,
I
'
ll
talk
to
you
later
!
Good
night
!
🌙
💤
😴
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Hiiii

It

s
going
pretty
smoothly
,
it
isn
'
t
as
borning
as
yesterday
,
I
am
still
completing
my
alcohol
education
module
and
that
is
pretty
much
it
for
now
.
Also
that
boba
looked
so
good
,
I
wanted
one
so
bad
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
boba
was
perfect
for
how
hot
it
was
outside
👍
Nice
!!
How
much
do
you
have
left
?
I
’
m
doing
pretty
well
,
finished
a
lot
of
work
that
was
backlogged
and
then
got
boba
,
now
I
’
m
gonna
go
watch
a
movie
in
about
40
mins
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
say
about
80
%
done
with
the
1st
one
and
then
the
other
2
chapters
remain
.
Nice
nice
,
which
movie
are
you
going
to
watch
?
[sskarz]
Sheeeeeesh
she
’
s
a
scholar
I
’
m
gonna
go
watch
the
new
Mission
Impossible
movie
heard
it
was
amazing
so
I
gotta
check
it
out
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
interesting
.
Yea
people
say
its
cool
.
[sskarz]
Do
you
like
that
series
of
movies
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
nah
Um
I
have
never
watched
it
but
I
saw
that
they
did
the
bike
off
the
cliff
stunt
and
it
was
so
awesome
.
That
is
now
on
my
bucket
list
.
👍
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
crazy
that
Tom
cruise
does
his
own
insane
stunts
Like
hanging
off
the
side
of
a
plane
while
it
’
s
taking
off
Insane
[prabipyakurel]
Crazy
right
,
yea
he
makes
me
belive
I
can
do
those
things
,
but
hanging
off
the
plane
during
take
off
is
actually
insane
.
[sskarz]
Speaking
of
,
I
gotta
drive
to
the
theater
now
to
go
see
it
in
time
lol
,
I
’
ll
let
you
know
how
it
goes
!
Good
luck
on
your
courses
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
,
Have
fun
!!!
[sskarz]
So
the
AMC
I
’
m
at
just
had
the
fire
alarm
pulled
We
all
got
kicked
out
of
the
building
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
so
sorry
though
!
[sskarz]
Hahaha
nah
you
’
re
good
Super
unexpected
It
sucks
because
the
movie
was
getting
so
good
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
it
happened
in
the
middle
???
[sskarz]
Yeah
[prabipyakurel]
That
sucks
!
[sskarz]
Like
dead
in
the
middle
of
the
movie
during
a
chase
scene
[prabipyakurel]
lol
are
they
going
to
let
everyone
in
again
or
thats
it
?
[sskarz]
No
idea
[prabipyakurel]
U
still
waiting
outside
?
[sskarz]
This
is
like
worst
case
scenario
rn
,
I
had
a
meeting
planned
for
7
and
the
movie
would
’
ve
ended
on
that
hour
I
just
want
a
refund
now
and
come
back
later
lol
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
can
the
meeting
be
moved
or
no
?
[sskarz]
Unfortunately
it
’
s
a
mandatory
meeting
[prabipyakurel]
They
should
give
you
like
at
least
half
the
money
back
.
[sskarz]
And
I
have
to
attend
I
hope
I
get
the
full
refund
but
we
’
ll
see
🍀
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
maybe
they
will
let
you
in
soon
and
it
will
end
around
6
:
30
/
[sskarz]
No
chance
,
the
length
of
the
movie
wouldn
’
t
allow
it
to
end
on
time
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
Yea
then
its
probably
a
good
idea
to
head
home
and
come
back
tomorrow
.
You
can
watch
it
over
in
peace
.
[sskarz]
Haha
still
gotta
check
if
they
’
ll
even
give
me
a
refund
[prabipyakurel]
They
should
,
that
is
kinda
sad
.
[sskarz]
It
is
what
it
is
Happens
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Universal
rule
right
.
[sskarz]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
It
happens
sometimes
.
[sskarz]
Murphys
law
I
think
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Were
you
with
friends
?
[sskarz]
Nah
just
me
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
,
you
don
'
t
even
have
like
a
buddy
to
talk
to
outside
.
[sskarz]
Haha
I
joined
on
a
call
with
my
friends
and
they
’
re
all
laughing
rn
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
friends
to
that
,
you
laugh
first
and
then
ask
if
you
are
doing
ok
.
I

How

[prabipyakurel]
No

smooth
.
We

to
San
Francisco
tomorrow

so
I
was
just
packing
my
stuff

a
while

mint
ice
cream

,
that
was
good
!
👍
Hbu

[sskarz]

how
long
are
you
staying
there
for
?
I
don
'
t
even

if
I
can
fit
it
all
in
one
discord
message
lol
[prabipyakurel]
We
will
be
back
by
Monday
night
,
not
too
long
.
Give
it
a
try
.
[sskarz]
Well
I
'
ll
give
the
short
version
:
-
woke
up
,
went
to
the
gym
with
some
friends
and
took
2
hours
-
straight
out
from
there
,
went
to
return
at
least
a
dozen
amazon
packages
that
took
like
an
hour
and
a
half
-
got
to
work
and
practiced
for
the
course
tomorrow
-
3
different
meetings
back
to
back
with
my
club
and
everest
IT
stuff
-
went
to
the
movie
theater
to
get
my
refund
from
yesterday
-
at
the
same
time
,
had
to
go
do
a
gift
exchange
with
a
friend
and
got
food
with
them
-
went
back
to
my
house
and
then
to
my
uncle
'
s
house
for
momo
-
got
called
unexpectedly
to
go
back
home
and
fetch
an
item
and
drive
back
-
and
now
i
'
m
here
finally
home
its
been
quite
a
day
lol
also
is
this
for
vacation
or
for
work
?
[prabipyakurel]
We
are
just
going
to
visit
Berkeley
before
I
officially
move
there
for
good
,
maybe
meet
a
few
nepali
people
there
and
friends
that
are
already
there
.
That
was
quite
a
day
you
had
lol
.
You
ever
finish
that
movie
though
?
[sskarz]
that
'
s
good
!
are
you
going
to
be
visiting
your
dorm
as
well
?
got
the
refund
,
just
gotta
find
time
again
to
go
back
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Not
ready
yet
,
also
cant
go
inside
some
buildings
on
sundays
,
at
least
I
dont
think
so
.
Ahhh
thats
good
.
[sskarz]
oh
so
just
going
around
the
campus
and
familiarizing
yourself
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
Weather
,
food
,
and
people
of
that
region
.
[sskarz]
that
'
s
awesome
!
I
'
d
love
to
see
pictures
of
the
campus
if
you
do
take
some
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
for
sure
,
I
will
be
like
snapping
each
building
.
Gotta
remember
so
my
little
self
doesn
'
t
get
lost
when
I
get
there
lol
Watch
me
go
listen
to
a
totally
different
lecture
.
[sskarz]
Do
it
!
Pretend
you
’
re
already
a
student
lol
See
what
it
’
s
like
I
wonder
if
you
’
ll
be
in
a
lecture
hall
[prabipyakurel]
You
already
know
!
❤
️
Maybe
,
probably
,
not
too
sure
.
Imma
walk
in
like
I
already
rule
the
school
.
[sskarz]
Do
you
like
the
idea
of
taking
classes
in
a
lecture
hall
opposed
to
a
regular
classroom
?
Hell
yeahhhhhhh
you
deserve
to
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
prefer
smaller
classes
and
more
intimate
teaching
sessions
where
I
get
to
participate
and
be
able
to
ask
questions
.
But
if
it
is
a
lecture
halls
,
I
will
probably
use
the
office
hours
.
[sskarz]
Same
,
never
was
a
fan
it
’
s
way
harder
to
ask
questions
and
also
hear
the
professor
at
times
imo
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
,
and
I
don
'
t
want
to
be
a
teachers
pet
or
anything
but
I
like
it
when
the
professor
knows
my
name
and
will
actually
listen
to
my
questions
.
💯
Gotta
get
teachers
for
future
rec
.
letters
too
.
[sskarz]
Yup
!
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
if
thats
only
me
though
!
[sskarz]
No
no
I
do
the
same
thing
lol
👍
Just
got
one
from
my
cs
professor
of
last
semester
actually
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
he
/
she
probably
wrote
like
5
pages
about
how
great
of
a
student
you
are
.
[sskarz]
it
’
s
better
to
be
interactive
with
the
professor
and
rack
up
those
recommendations
💯
Uhhuh
no
😂
I
got
a
very
nice
letter
that
said
I
listened
and
participated
often
and
did
well
in
the
class
Which
I
will
take
pride
of
100
%
👍
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
!
you
are
like
5
steps
ahead
of
everyone
in
there
.
[sskarz]
Mmmm
idk
some
people
in
there
out
to
make
the
next
google
or
something
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Next
google
,
lol
[sskarz]
U
know
those
people
that
are
like
geniuses
since
the
day
they
were
conceived
Like
those
people
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
so
many
people
,
there
are
people
out
there
that
were
born
brilliant
and
I
am
there
just
thinking
about
how
they
will
take
over
the
world
.
[sskarz]
Frrrr
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
am
there
just
like
,
"
yep
no
,
can
'
t
be
like
you
"
[sskarz]
We
try
our
hardest
tho
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
everyone
is
brilliant
in
their
own
way
,
weather
its
with
a
hobby
,
talent
,
or
academics
.
[sskarz]
And
at
the
end
of
the
day
I
’
d
rather
be
a
hard
working
normal
person
than
a
lazy
genius
lol
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
I
will
just
be
ME
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmmmmm
tell
‘
em
all
❤
️
Have
you
talked
with
your
dorm
mate
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
,
its
still
not
finalized
and
I
dont
think
I
am
going
to
be
put
with
my
friend
.
I
just
hope
the
person
I
am
staying
with
is
nice
and
respectful
.
And
have
the
ability
to
kill
bugs
out
of
our
dorm
.
[sskarz]
Awwww
damn
that
sucks
Well
good
luck
with
that
💀
😂
Yeah
I
think
you
’
ll
be
fine
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
but
it
is
what
it
is
,
maybe
I
will
make
new
friends
out
there
.
[sskarz]
100
%
u
will
go
out
there
and
be
that
social
butterfly
❤
️

the
whole
university
experience
just

bit
more
bearable
lol
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]

an
entire
field
of
them
[sskarz]

truck
carrying
tomatoes

some
local
pizza
joint

[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
but
wanted
to
try
something

anymore
for
the

cheeked
up
**
thicc

It

the
way
you
described
it
[sskarz]

was
like
chicken
,
bell
peppers
,
onions
,
and
some
other
stuff
i
can
'
t
remember
but
it
was
like
juicy
and
multiple
flavors
hitting
the
mouth
it
was
great
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
so
it
was
like
thick
thick
type
with
toppings
[sskarz]
mhmmmmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
You

like
one
of
those
food
tasters
at
a
cooking
show

pride
in
my
taste
buds
💀

took
the
sunday
to
just
relax
and
have
fun
with
friends
you
'
re
probably
exhausted
after
all
of
that
huh
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
a
little
,
also
had
momos
at
Berkeley
,
so
it
felt
like
home
there
too
.
Just
stuffed
and
yes
a
little
tired
ig
.
[sskarz]
there
is
a
nepali
restaurant
there
?
:
O
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
the
same
thought
ran
through
my
head
[sskarz]
well
that
is
a
godsend
lol
💯
momos
always
be
hitting
the
right
spots
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
They
do
,
we
ordered
and
got
my
friend
who
gave
us
a
tour
to
try
with
us
,
and
she
loved
it
too
.
But
like
the
wrapper
was
made
with
dough
and
it
was
way
too
“
thicc
”
so
after
like
5
I
was
done
.
😂
[sskarz]
**
thicc
**
momos
😂
those
look
fire
tho
that
marsala
too
ooooooooooo
was
it
spicy
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
the
sauce
was
pretty
good
,
not
as
spicy
but
good
No
the
momos
weren
’
t
[sskarz]
aw
damn
[prabipyakurel]
We
ordered
chow
Mein
and
the
spice
on
that
was
on
point
It
was
momos
and
boba
[sskarz]
so
what
im
hearing
is
you
have
the
best
food
right
next
to
campus
?
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
[sskarz]
that
'
s
awesomeeeee
im

[prabipyakurel]
Well
if
you
ever
come
visit
Berkeley
,
we
will
eat
there
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
its
a
hell
of
a
drive
but
if
i
ever
happen
to
stop
by
san
fran
,
for
sure
!
seems
like
a
really
pretty
place
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
a
long
drive
,
we
arrived
at
11
:
15
yesterday
lol
[sskarz]
omg
when
did
you
leave
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
We
left
at
4
:
30
yesterday
Then
had
a
traffic
stop
for
an
hour
,
and
a
detour
delaying
another
30
min
.
It
is
what
it
is
😂
[sskarz]
yeah
that
is
roughhhhhhh
almost
8
hour
drive
is
wild
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
Crazy
[sskarz]
were
you
able
to
go
to
your
dorm
at
all
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
my
friend
was
able
to
sneak
me
into
her
temporary
dorm
where
I
met
her
roommate
,
and
it
was
nice
.
It
comes
with
a
microwave
and
mini
fridge
[sskarz]
niceeeeeeeeeeee
[prabipyakurel]
But
didn
’
t
get
to
see
my
dorm
specifically
[sskarz]
ah
i
see
so
your
friend
already
settled
in
?
[prabipyakurel]
That
was
for
the
summer
,
when
the
fall
sem
starts
she
moves
to
another
dorm
.
But
she
knows
her
way
around
the
place
Gonna
take
her
with
me
everywhere
👍
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
makes
sense
at
least
having
a
friend
bringing
you
places
will
help
you
get
accustomed
quick
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
Felt
scary
though
idk
why
,
I
am
still
not
ready
to
leave
home
[sskarz]
its
just
a
little
taste
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

I
got
3
more
weeks
in
LA

will
get
the
full
taste
Damn

me
realize
how

summer
went
by
[sskarz]
it
really
is
,

like
i
did
so
much
and
so
little
at
the
same
time
lol
💯

browse
through
the
song
real
quick
now
[sskarz]
I
forget
my
spotify
has
a
profile
pic
💀
💀
that
pic
was
like
from
freshman
year
of
high
school
if
i
remember
,
its
right
before
i
went
to
one
of
the
dances
at
my
school
it
may
not
be
your
cup
of
tea
,
this
playlists
just
has
a
bunch
of
songs
that
give
that
kind
of
airy
vibe
with
its
production
so
like
when
you
want
to
space
your
mind
out
on
a
drive
or
something
like
that
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
I
will
listen
to
them
,
maybe
know
some
❤
️
[sskarz]
i
guess
a
way
to
put
it
is
like
calming
in
a
sort
of
way
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
thanks
!
[sskarz]
i
actually
sleep
to
this
playlist
as
well
😂
either
that
or
Mac
Miller
'
s
Circles
album
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
[sskarz]
for
the
past
like
2
years
,
i
'
ve
programmed
my
brain
to
just
fall
asleep
quicker
with
music
from
my
phone
speaker
that
'
s
just
quiet
enough
to
not
disrupt
anything
idk
how
it
started
but
its
just
like
that
now
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
yea
I
tried
that
once
and
forgot
to
turn
off
the
music
And
in
the
morning
my
phone
was
like
on
the
floor
,
and
I
realized
that
that
was
a
bad
idea
I
need
a
timer
on
the
music
because
I
sleep
through
like
the
1st
to
2nd
song
[sskarz]
same
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
get
you
[sskarz]
except
it
just
keeps
going
till
the
morning
lol
ooooooooh
wanna
try
something
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
that
happens
??
[sskarz]
there
'
s
this
thing
called
a
spotify
pie
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
never
heard
of
that
[sskarz]
and
so
it
shows
like
a
bunch
of
genres
and
artists
that
you
'
ve
listened
to
over
your
spotify
account
'
s
time
let
me
show
you
mine
so
like
the
pie
chart
represents
the
genres
i
listen
to
the
most
and
then
the
artists
from
top
to
bottom
represent
which
ones
i
listen
to
the
most
and
then
it
just
keeps
going
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
Where
do
you
check
that
[sskarz]
you
don
'
t
have
to
share
yours
,
but
you
can
look
at
it
here
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
tells
me
to
log
in
and
I
don
’
t
remember
my
spotify
password
when
it
told
me
to
log
in
again
.
Sorry
,
when
I
get
back
tomorrow
I
will
check
But
I
didn
’
t
know
this
existed
[sskarz]
nah
you
'
re
good
haha
yeah
there
'
s
tons
of
these
spotify
stat
things
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
spotify
curates
one
officially
of
everything
you
listened
to
in
that
year
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
o
have
heard
about
that
one
tho
[sskarz]
that
'
s
the
big
one
everyone
looks
forward
to
yep
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
and
seems
like
you
are
into
rap
and
hip
hop
I
don
’
t
know
a
lot
but
when
someone
introduces
something
I
like
it
.
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
do
i
really
got
into
the
genre
around
2021
before
that
,
i
listened
to
like
electronic
music
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
pretty
recent
[sskarz]
yep
i
wasn
'
t
really
a
big
music
listener
if
im
honest
life
happened
and
then
i
had
to
find
some
new
stuff
to
get
into
so
i
got
into
hip
hop
/
rap
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
sometimes
life
gives
you
pain
,
and
the
lyrics
to
songs
are
like
so
good
to
connect
to
.
I
feel
you
💯
❤
️
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
one
day
in
2021
i
was
at
my
lowest
of
lows
like
truly
just
rock
bottom
like
none
other
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
[sskarz]
and
then
i
discovered
an
artist
named
Logic
and
i
really
got
into
his
music
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
[sskarz]
and
i
liked
his
music
so
much
that
i
got
to
meet
him
last
year
in
person
music
really
heals
the
soul
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
that
’
s
soooo
cool
[sskarz]
got
to
meet
full
circle
mhmmmmm
it
was
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
happy
for
you
that
you
met
someone
that
helped
you
through
his
music
and
all
,
that
must
have
felt
good
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
i
let
him
know
about
all
that
and
he
gave
me
a
hug
,
was
like
top
5
moments
ever
for
me
haha
❤
️
so
now
im
just
connected
with
music
a
lot
more
than
a
couple
years
back
i
listen
to
a
lot
of
variety
,
outside
of
hiphop
and
rap
obviously
not
as
much
but
i
do
dabble
in
other
categories
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
.
What
happened
to
you
during
2021
,
if
I
may
ask
?
You
don
’
t
need
to
tell
me
if
you
aren
’
t
comfortable
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
you
'
re
good
!
i
actually
went
through
a
breakup
that
was
rough
definitely
not
a
good
one
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
I
am
so
sorry
.
[sskarz]
no
no
you
'
re
fine
don
'
t
worry
i
'
m
comfortable
talking
about
stuff
like
this
it
was
a
rough
time
of
being
confused
emotionally
ultimately
things
just
did
not
work
out
and
it
was
like
fireworks
for
a
month
but
i
got
back
on
my
feet
soon
enough
,
turned
my
mentality
around
and
i
'
ve
been
so
much
better
since
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
I
feel
so
bad
,
but
things
get
better
overtime
,
just
focus
on
yourself
and
everything
will
work
out
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
exactly
what
i
did
!
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
friend
also
went
through
in
a
traumatic
way
and
I
have
not
been
in
any
relationships
to
give
advice
but
you
are
an
amazing
person
and
sometimes
universe
tells
you
to
let
people
go
.
Again
,
not
a
professional
person
to
take
advice
from
.
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
,
you
'
re
saying
all
the
right
things
😂
i
agree
with
everything
❤
️
it
doesn
'
t
bother
me
anymore
,
learned
so
much
from
that
experience
,
and
now
i
'
m
just
all
the
more
wiser
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
,
that
was
sad
to
hear
,
I
am
sorry
if
I
reminded
you
of
things
.
Go
Sanskar
!!!
❤
️
[sskarz]
oh
please
,
its
been
2
years
,
i
look
back
at
the
experience
not
negatively
,
but
positively
because
ultimately
it
made
me
so
much
better
as
a
person
in
my
opinion
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
that
’
s
good
.
[sskarz]
so
yeah
,

me
im
an
open
book

:)
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
I
always
find
dogs
in
shoes
and
clothes
so
cuteeee
[sskarz]
the
only
thing
he
is
willing
to
compromise
for
is
his
collar
he
will
not
allow
anything
else
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[sskarz]
we
tried
putting
a
sweater
and
socks
on
him
but
he
just
tore
them
to
shreds
[prabipyakurel]
Ugh

vicious
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
just
leave
him
be
with
a
collar
[sskarz]
i
got
a
cute
pic
of
him
yesterday
tho
you
might
'
ve
saw
it
yesterday
from
my
sister
'
s
story
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

one
[sskarz]
yeah

one
lol
he
'
s
such
a
happy
boi
i
love
him
to
death
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
I
would
too
,
I
mean
he
lives
with
you
I
am
sure
if
we
get
used
to
him
he
would
be
friendly
[sskarz]
u
just
gotta
keep
coming
to
my
house
,
dw
he
'
ll
get
used
to
u
quick
👍
speak
some
nepali
to
him
😂
usually
that
and
giving
him
like
50
treats
convinces
him
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
imma
say
namaste
instead
of
saying
hi
[sskarz]
gotta
take
the
first
steps
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
[sskarz]
he
'
ll
recognize
you
as
one
of
ours
lol
not
immediately
,
but
soon
actually
this
doggo
forgot
who
was
the
one
that
brought
him
into
our
house
the
first
day
my
friend
bijesh
got
to
see
bear
after
like
a
really
long
time
,
and
he
just
forgot
who
he
was
and
now
bear
treats
him
as
a
stranger
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
lol
[sskarz]
he
used
to
be
all
over
him
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
feel
like
once
you
see
a
dog
for
a
while
,
you
get
used
to
it
[sskarz]
100
%
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
just
don
’
t
give
any
dog
a
chance
or
myself
to
get
near
them
[sskarz]
if
you
come
over
,
I
'
ll
help
you
slowly
warm
up
to
bear
dw
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
[sskarz]
he
looks
vicious
but
he
'
s
like
the
kindest
mischeavous
soul
ever
[prabipyakurel]
Seems
really
cute
[sskarz]
and
he
'
s
soft
to
pet
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
dog
pictures
I
have
only
pet
a
few
[sskarz]
once
you
get
used
to
them
,
it
becomes
alot
easier
idk
how
to
explain
it
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
makes
sense
[sskarz]
they
will
just
gravitate
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
how
my
uncle
got
me
used
to
their
chihuahuas
[sskarz]
oh
he
has
multiple
?
[prabipyakurel]
2
[sskarz]
dang
[prabipyakurel]
They
do
that
run
down
the
stairs
when
we
go
there
And
I
wait
for
someone
to
pick
them
up
[sskarz]
i
'
m
personally
not
the
biggest
fan
of
that
breed
simply
becasue
as
a
kid
,
back
at
my
old
house
,
this
neighbor
i
lived
next
to
had
like
5
of
them
,
and
they
'
d
all
start
yapping
at
the
crack
of
dawn
or
in
the
middle
of
the
night
awwwww
that
is
cute
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl
I
find
their
barks
very
sharp
Like
not
in
a
good
way
But
yes
they
are
cute
,
one
is
chunky
and
likes
to
sit
and
the
other
keeps
messing
with
him
It
’
s
funny
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
hurt
my
ears
as
a
kid
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
Hey

Sorry
I
'
m
a
bit
late
to
reply
,
just
came
out
of
2
back
to
back
meetings
boring
as
I
predicted
,
we
were
changing
the
constitution
for
our
club
so
we
had
to
go
line
by
line
of
the
20
+
page
constitution
to
change
wording
and
stuff
I
slept
pretty
early
last
night
,
I
was
so
tired
from
that
meeting
👍
how
'
re
you
doing
?
how
was
your
day
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes

had
a
busy
morning
.
😵
‍
💫
No
need
to
say
sorry
lol
,
totally
fine
.
Right
now
,
I
feel
better
,
last
night
after
we
got
home
,
around
like
9
,
I
looked
at
your
message
and
texted
back
and
then
passed
out
.
But
the
trip
was
amazing
,
we
came
back
through
the
beach
area
on
the
101
freeway
and
the
scenes
were
like
so
beautiful
.
[sskarz]
oooooooooh
yeah
the
drive
right
next
to
the
beach
is
really
nice
especially
because
that
breeze
can
come
through
the
car
windows
and
its
super
refreshing
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
right
u
playing
chess
with
my
brother
rn
?
lol
he
was
so
happy
and
excited
❤
️
[sskarz]

wanted
to
play
so
I
'
m
trying
to
access
the

I

now
finishing
a
another
course
about
safety
on
campus
,
binge
watching
a
english
/
hindi
movie
and
will
probably
just
see
what
we
can
do
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
How

you
?
other
than
chess
ofc
.
[sskarz]

with
those
safety
courses
lol
i
'
ve

a
family
dinner

'
s
pretty
much
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

there
.
Ahhhhh

cool
,
yea
family
time
is
always
nice
.
Also
I
started
listening
to
your
playlist
and
i
haven
'
t
gotten
far
,
but
some
of
them
are
pretty
good
.
[sskarz]
omg
💀
what
songs
have
you
liked
?
[prabipyakurel]
in
your
eyes
,
two
tens
,
bugs
only
got
through
a
few
[sskarz]
💯
those
songs
are
bangers
especially
bugs
,
I
love
that
artist
I
discovered
khai
dreams
when
he
only
had
like
200
listeners
a
really
long
time
ago
,
now
he
'
s
got
like
4
million
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
that
is
quite
a
jump
[sskarz]
super
down
to
earth
guy
and
made
some
really
good
music
if
you
liked
bugs
,
you
will
like
his
album
Nice
Colors
used
to
be
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
mean
I
am
always
willing
to
listen
to
new
songs
,
maybe
rap
,
but
don
'
t
know
what
to
exactly
listen
through
But
yea
imma
go
through
your
playlist
,
listen
and
add
it
to
mine
lol
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
actually
did
listen
to
your
playlist
as
well
,
put
me
right
back
in
time
haha
[prabipyakurel]
oh
like
wayyyyyyy
back
[sskarz]
felt
like
it
was
the
good
days
[prabipyakurel]
those
are
like
the
old
old
old
songs
for
sure
[sskarz]
2016
-
2018
were
crazy
years
but
had
some
absolute
classics
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
heard
you
won
the
game
,
good
job
!
[sskarz]
its
been
a
long
time
since
I
'
ve
played
chess
so
brain
muscle
memory
kicked
in
haha
its
a
game
about
pattern
recognition
,
so
as
soon
as
you
see
one
of
those
that
you
recognize
,
its
a
lot
easier
to
act
on
it
if
that
makes
any
sense
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yea
my
brain
doesnt
work
when
playing
that
game
[sskarz]
you
just
gotta
do
chess
puzzles
👍
get
that
pattern
recognition
burned
into
your
brain
and
then
its
like
you
feel
like
a
genius
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
quite
a
feeling
that
is
[sskarz]
its
like
having
that
eureka
moment
over
and
over
again
dopamine
intensive
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
did
I
tell
you
what
happened
on
the
road
yesterday
?
wait

you
busy
[sskarz]
no
no
im
not
busy
hold
on
there
we
go
i
was
on
DND
i

😂
what
happened
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
we
were
coming
back
from
SF
like
an
hour
away
from
reaching
bakersfield
,
(
about
the
time
when
I
sent
those
marvelous
cow
pictures
),
we
were
driving
at
a
pretty
constant
normal
freeway
rate
.
And
this
guy
in
a
white
honda
came
next
to
us
,
flipped
us
off
,
looked
at
my
dad
and
drove
in
font
of
him
.
GOd
damn
I
was
about
to
do
the
same
but
my
parents
said
no
.
Then
there
was
traffic
so
that
guy
got
stuck
wayyyyy
behind
us
.
That
was
karma
.
lol
sorry
for
taking
so
long
,
baba
called
and
I
was
talking
to
him
too
.
[sskarz]
haha
you
'
re
good
oh
dang
wtf
i
mean
yeah
the
right
thing
to
do
is
not
to
provoke
any
other
actions
but
the
way
i
would
'
ve
flipped
him
off
too
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
i
was
so
mad
,
i
wanted
to
do
that
mr
.
bean
thing
,
have
you
seen
it
?
[sskarz]
oh

😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
would
be
funny
asf
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
crazy
,
and
i
thought
I
was
the
only
once
that
saw
,
and
my
mom
was
like
"
you
see
that
"
It
was
a
white
dude
that
was
bald
,
skinny
,
and
had
a
white
beard
.
I
literally
wised
for
him
to
die
in
a
ditch
.
💀
[sskarz]
bro
is
most
definitely
on
something
[prabipyakurel]
He
was
so
mean
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
prolly
racist
[prabipyakurel]
ofc
like
a
white
dude
,
yep
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
weirdos
[prabipyakurel]
my
parents
told
me
not
to
do
the
same
in
case
he
starts
to
like
follow
us
or
something
[sskarz]
yeah
provoking
is
usually
never
good
but
you
can
shit
talk
after
they
'
re
gone
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yes
I
need
to
keep
that
in
mind
oh
yea
i
said
all
of
the
words
to
him
in
my
head
😂
like
nepali
and
english
bad
words
you
dont
even
know
[sskarz]
omg
not
the
nepali
words
too
💀
💀
[prabipyakurel]
yea
those
are
fun
to
say
to
someone
especially
when
they
wont
understand
them
[sskarz]
hahaha
I
don
'
t
really
know
any
bad
words
in
Nepali
my
dad
says
them
sometimes
but
I
can
'
t
remember
I
'
m
pure
fr
💀
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

my
collection
to
use
lol
parents

them
during
traffic
and
when
they
mess
up
on
daily
tasks
sometimes
,

funny
[sskarz]

like

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I
love
people
that
can
show
their
anger
,

to
cuss
someone
out
at
times
ngl
[sskarz]
no
no
i
love
seeing
her
road
rage
its
funny
af
😂
[prabipyakurel]
road
rages
are
funny
[sskarz]
yeah
usually
when
the
person
is
driving
below
speed
limit
and
you
cant
drive
around
them
[prabipyakurel]
you
dont
like
try
to
calm
her
down
when
she
is
mad
on
the
road
,
you
are
like
"
go
on
sis
"
🤣
[sskarz]
yeah
sounds
about
right
LOL
i
be
road
raging
with
her
😂
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
a
mood
imagine
yelling
at
someone
as
a
group
omg
that
would
be
so
cool
[sskarz]
oooooof
yeah
been
there
done
that
this
is
why
i
don
'
t
provoke
anymore
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
can
do
it
in
a
safe
way
when
you
know
that
the
roads
separate
from
that
person
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
i
be
talking
mad
shit
about
that
person
for
like
at
least
5
minutes
[prabipyakurel]
lol

you
are
alone
too
?
[sskarz]
and
then

road

there
done
that
gotten
better
at
keeping
up
with
the
speed
limit

some
time
to
get
used
to
going
fast
safely
not
speeding
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
just
getting
used
to
higher
speeds

driving
for
a
little
bit
[prabipyakurel]
wow

pretty
good
time
[sskarz]
so

a
while
to
be
super
comfortable
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
even
now
,
when
I
know
I
am
driving
I
have
to
double
check
mirror
,
seats
and
everything
before
heading
off
.
[sskarz]
oh

that
'
s
always
important
,
i

but
like
i
mean
getting
uesd
to
roads
you
recognize
and
like
driving
in
LA
and
how
everything
is
a
one
way
street
that
stuff
is
scary
at
first
but
you
get
used
to
it
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
have
to
put
everything
in
the
car
the
same
for
my
aprents
to
drive
as
well
.
yep
,
its
going
to
take
some
practice
to
be
able
to
make
quick
road
decisions
driving
[sskarz]
i
used
to
have
a
really
bad
habit
panicking
when
i
used
to
drive
early
on
so
like
if
someone
came
too
close
to
me
in
the
freeway
and
edging
into
my
lane
,
i
would
like
immediately
turn
to
the
other
lane
without
checking
and
so
many
times
that
could
'
ve
gone
wrong
lol
just
try
to
stay
calm
at
all
times
idk
if
what
i
said
helps
sat
all
but
just
from
my
experience
[prabipyakurel]
omg
i
do
that
on
normal
roads
sometimes
especially
when
i
drive
pass
a
bus
that
is
picking
up
people
and
merges
back
into
the
lane
next
to
me
.
[sskarz]
oh
i
hate
that
i
hate
busses
in
general
lol
💯
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
helps
,
I
am
always
freaking
out
or
one
of
those
cars
that
merge
in
without
their
signals
A
tesla
did
that
last
time
and
I
was
so
mad
[sskarz]
its
always
the
teslas
and
the
BMWs
[prabipyakurel]
always
...
do
you
do
that
?
[sskarz]
no
no
im
a
turn
signaler
👍
its
super
important
to
do
that
,
and
its
not
like
its
super
hard
to
do
lol
that
'
s
just
something
i
picked
up
on
as
i
drove
around
👍
[prabipyakurel]
ik
thats
what
I
said
,
some
cars
act
like
those
dont
even
exist
[sskarz]
fr
and
like
the
tail
gating
BMWs
especially
they
just
wanna
drive
100
on
a
30
for
no
reason
[prabipyakurel]
right
,
they
beep
when
I
am
driving
normally
and
refuse
to
just
go
in
front
of
me
using
the
other
lane
[sskarz]
frrrr
intrusive
thoughts
:
hard
brake
and
make
them
hit
you
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
then
they
damage
your
car
too
You
know
when
someone
is
going
too
slow
in
front
of
you
and
have
the
urge
to
like
"
should
I
just
rear
end
this
thing
to
make
it
move
faster
"
💀
[sskarz]
exactly
the
reason
why
its
intrusive
thoughts
😂
😂
...
yes
but
intrusive
thoughts
will
never
get
to
me
hopefully
never
[prabipyakurel]
I
pray
[sskarz]
like
one
of
my
big
ones
is
dropping
my
phone
into
that
slight
gap
between
a
floor
and
an
elevator
everytime
i
think
about
it
but
i
have
to
resist
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
about
that
too
,
or
like
anywhere
with
a
gap
to
be
specific
like
keys
on
top
of
a
drain
area
[sskarz]
intrusive
thoughts
got
me
my
scar
so
i
learned
my
lesson
💀
[prabipyakurel]
gotta
be
able
to
hold
it
in
fr
[sskarz]
oh
nahhhhhh
😂
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
,
on
your
face
right
,
what
happened
?
did
doggy
scratch
you
?
[sskarz]
i
fought
a
bear
straight
on
nah
im
joking
[prabipyakurel]
lol
bear
dog
or
bear
bear
[sskarz]
i
was
just
a
dumb
idiot
in
a
dumb
makeshift
water
park
that
looked
like
it
was
held
together
with
glue
and
duct
tape
who
knows
:
think
:
i
tripped
and
fell
into
a
water
slide
made
of
metal
and
really
fast
water
,
so
much
so
that
the
water
cut
my
cheek
clean
and
the
wound
was
kind
of
deep
that
place
is
now
no
longer
operating
obviously
but
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
god
,
were
you
under
parent
supervision
or
no
?
[sskarz]
yeah
i
was
my
whole
family
saw
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
was
like
zooming
into
this
emoji
thingy
oooooooo
yikes
,
it
probably
hurt
a
lot
[sskarz]
actually
quite
the
opposite
i
didn
'
t
even
notice
my
cheek
was
cut
[prabipyakurel]
I
fr
thought
that
your
dog
slapped
you
and
you
ended
up
with
that
😂
[sskarz]
he
could
give
me
a
second
one
for
sure
😂
[prabipyakurel]
that
would
probably
be
messy
lets
not
encourage
that
weird
,
you
were
just
like
oh
wow
,
i
fell
[sskarz]
nah
he
'
s
the
sweetest
boi
,
he
would
never
[prabipyakurel]
well
not
to
you
at
least
[sskarz]
no
yeah
i
went
down
the
slide
and
came
out
the
small
pool
at
the
end
of
it
and
i
was
going
for
round
2
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
am
assuming
you
didnt
[sskarz]
and
then
my
parents
screamed
and
then
i
was
like
huh
and
then
i
just
saw
blood
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
down
and
then
i
screamed
for
like
a
second
before
i
passed
out
and
woke
up
at
the
ER
lol
didn
'
t
really
feel
pain
adrenaline
kicked
in
real
quick
😭
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
you
had
to
be
taken
to
the
ER
[sskarz]
mhmm
i
got
stitches
this
was
all
on
vacation
too
[prabipyakurel]
how
old
were
you
?
[sskarz]
i
was
like
9
or
10
i
think
it
'
s
been
close
to
a
decade
since
[prabipyakurel]
pretty
young
tho
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
scar
is
still
there
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
yikes

crazy
[sskarz]
the
doctors
said
it
will
never
fully
fade
away
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
hey
brb
[sskarz]
I
embrace
it
,
its
a
part
of
me
now
and
it
just
makes
more
unique
so

a
gift
lol
❤

such
good
Nepali
food
in
so
long
[prabipyakurel]

food
on
that
menu
looked
real
good
.
[sskarz]
If
you

want
top
tier
Nepali
food
,

Everest
Cuisine
Plus
it
was
my
student
’
s
restaurant
so
I
got
to
see
my
3
students
too
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
thats
adorable
For
sure
.
[sskarz]
oh
from
the
menu
I
forgot
to
say
,
I
had
fried
chicken
momo
and
chicken
tikka
masala
with
garlic
naan
both
of
my
favorite
dishes
back
to
back
was
amazing
❤
️
Wbu
?
You
said
you
were
making
dinner
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
i
love
naan
with
like
any
type
of
curry
I
made
biryani
for
the
first
time
and
it
was
actually
pretty
good
.
So
I
had
that
with
some
panda
orange
chicken
and
grilled
chicken
.
I
also
made
raita
,
if
you
know
that
that
is
.
[sskarz]
Ay
nice
!!!
That
sounds
really
good
Yep
,
tho
not
the
biggest
fan
[prabipyakurel]
really
,
you
dont
like
it
it
goes
well
with
naan
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
for
me
imo
[prabipyakurel]
yea
its
not
like
my
favourite
thing
,
but
its
good
to
have
it
once
in
a
while
[sskarz]
idk
maybe
just
haven
’
t
had
a
super
good
one
yet
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
maybe
Yea
some
places
make
it
better
than
others
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
Omg
that
reminds
me
I
had
Nepali
food
back
in
Paris
and
it
was
so
mid
[prabipyakurel]
lol
nepali
food
in
paris
[sskarz]
but
then
they
had
like
a
corner
Indian
restaurant
with
like
the
best
butter
chicken
I
’
ve
ever
had
yeah
we
got
sick
of
French
food
overrated
imo
[prabipyakurel]
yea
where
ever
you
go
,
you
need
to
get
some
sort
of
nepali
/
indian
food
Did
you
have
a
favorite
at
least
?
[sskarz]
Well
there
was
this
one
breakfast
place
and
it
was
right
next
to
the
view
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
And
that
was
really
good
for
the
first
time
having
breakfast
food
in
Paris
But
all
the
restaurants
eventually
felt
like
they
all
tasted
the
exact
same
[prabipyakurel]
That
view
sounds
lovely
.
Oh
lol
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
it
was
awesome
I
forgot
to
ask
What
’
s
your
dream
location
to
visit
?
[prabipyakurel]
Switzerland
[sskarz]
Really
?
Why
if
I
may
ask
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
loooooove
chocolate
and
that
is
like
the
home
of
chocolates
.
That
is
my
#
1
reason
and
second
the
views
are
to
die
for
.
The
greenlands
and
some
of
them
have
ziplines
and
bungee
jumping
places
too
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
yeah
I
forget
that
they
’
re
known
for
their
chocolate
and
of
course
the
views
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
cant
go
wrong
with
chololate
like
ever
[sskarz]
Frrrrr
that
’
s
a
really
good
answer
tho
❤
️
I
have
never
heard
that
one
before
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
people
ask
me
all
the
time
and
for
like
the
past
5
years
,
it
has
been
switzerland
.
[sskarz]
Completely
valid
💯
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
don
'
t
even
wanna
take
pictures
or
anything
,
I
will
walk
out
of
my
hotel
in
sweatpants
and
go
chocolate
shopping
.
[sskarz]
omg
that
really
is
the
life
Wake
up
to
a
beautiful
sunrise
on
top
of
green
hills
That
’
s
like
peak
life
right
there
👍
[prabipyakurel]
right
like
not
a
lot
of
buildings
and
people
,
just
simple
scenery
and
peacefulness
[sskarz]
So
then
you
would
choose
a
cabin
in
the
woods
with
a
lake
over
the
city
life
right
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
pretty
much
If
I
am
going
to
go
to
a
place
to
take
in
the
scenery
,
it
better
not
be
like
looking
out
the
vegas
hotel
window
and
seeing
buildings
lol
.
[sskarz]
Oh
I
agree
with
you
on
that
[prabipyakurel]
We
see
that
here
all
the
time
,
no
fun
.
[sskarz]
nature
>
industrial
stuff
💯
Mhmmm
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
have
a
dream
destination
,
or
have
you
already
visited
?
[sskarz]
Well
I
’
ve
never
visited
Nor
will
I
visit
ever
most
likely
lol
It
’
s
space
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
Who
knows
,
maybe
you
will
get
a
chance
.
Life
is
unexpected
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
if
I
’
m
being
truly
honest
it
’
s
space
❤
️
Butttttttt
In
terms
of
being
on
earth
I
’
d
say
Tokyo
or
Singapore
Because
of
the
culture
there
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
those
places
sound
awesome
.
Why
those
?
[sskarz]
For
Singapore
I
’
d
say
because
of
the
many
many
cultures
that
reside
in
that
country
,
like
one
big
melting
pot
and
also
it
’
s
beautiful
For
Tokyo
I
’
d
say
because
I
love
Japanese
food
and
their
culture
and
they
have
so
many
beautiful
cherry
blossom
trees
and
temples
that
I
’
d
love
to
explore
[prabipyakurel]
So
true
,
singapore
is
so
beautiful
,
I
wanna
visit
a
lot
of
asian
countries
and
try
on
their
clothes
and
learn
more
about
their
traditions
.
❤
️
Yes
sushi
and
shaking
a
cherry
blossom
tree
sound
bomb
.
😂
[sskarz]
I
was
just
about
to
say
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
lol
It
sounds
so
fun
[sskarz]
But
yeah
those
are
like
my
top
destinations
[prabipyakurel]
Those
are
really
great
choices
.
[sskarz]
Who
knows
if
nasa
ever
needs
someone
to
go
out
to
space
without
hopes
of
coming
back
,
im
first
in
line
[prabipyakurel]
without
hopes
of
coming
back
😂
[sskarz]
Not
because
I
would
like
to
die
but
just
so
I
can
be
in
space
💀
Only
way
I
’
m
getting
up
there
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
Yea
space
also
sounds
cool
,
but
thinking
about
it
,
I
would
probably
do
something
dumb
and
die
out
there
[sskarz]
Oh
me
too
100
%
[prabipyakurel]
The
little
person
inside
my
head
is
gonna
be
like
"
why
don
'
t
you
try
taking
the
suit
off
just
for
a
second
"
[sskarz]
If
NASA
offered
you
a
billion
dollars
for
your
family
but
only
if
you
went
to
space
and
flew
to
Mars
without
hopes
of
coming
back
,
would
u
do
it
The
intrusive
thoughts
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
those
be
popping
up
at
the
wrong
places
😂
For
my
family
,
hell
yeah
❤
️
anything
[sskarz]
Awwwww
that
’
s
sweet
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
family
and
friends
are
like
everything
,
I
would
literally
do
anything

?
[sskarz]
Me
too
,
gotta
keep
the
real
ones
close
💯
my
closest
friends
and
my
family
I
mean
I
’
m
just
glad
they
’
re
offering
money
,
shit
if
it
was
free
I
’
d
still
be
down
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
yea
it
would
be
fun
to
give
those
things
a
try
I
wanna
experience
it
,
whether
I
make
it
back
or
not
[sskarz]
Literally
a
death
sentence
💀
That
’
s
what
I
’
m
saying
But
then
I
think
about
those
that
I
leave
behind
and
then
I
have
to
think
lol
If
I
had
no
worries
of
that
then
I
go
in
a
heartbeat
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
when
I
make
any
dumb
decisions
I
think
about
that
lol
[sskarz]
Well
you
know
what
’
s
cool
?
A
new
moon
mission
is
being
prepared
and
set
for
launch
I
believe
2026
To
have
people
on
the
moon
again
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[sskarz]
I
envy
those
that
got
to
see
the
first
moon
landing
Have
I
made
it
apparent
yet
that
I
love
any
and
everything
space
related
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanted
to
experience
something
special
,
and
we
just
experienced
the
pandemic
.
But
its
cool
,
I
love
hearing
things
about
space
and
stuff
I
don
'
t
know
much
about
.
[sskarz]
It
certainly
was
…
a
time
Oh
I
could
ramble
for
hours
but
I
don
’
t
want
to
bore
you
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
people
be
telling
grandchildren
that
they
survived
like
an
attack
or
war
and
we
be
like
,
we
just
survived
a
disease
that
was
spreading
.
Hey
no
no
,
you
are
fine
,
its
interesting
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
the
black
plague
but
nowhere
near
as
deadly
😂
[prabipyakurel]
not
even
close
[sskarz]
I
appreciate
you
for
saying
that
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
dont
ever
need
to
feel
like
you
are
boring
me
,
trust
me
,
I
can
listen
and
talk
about
a
lot
of
things
for
hours
as
well
.
[sskarz]
Well
like
how
I
love
space
,
what
’
s
a
subject
that
you
love
to
learn
and
talk
about
?
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
had
a
brain
fart
right
now
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
you
’
re
good
,
I
put
you
on
the
spot
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
say
just
like
government
and
court
cases
Or
funny
things
presidents
have
done
[sskarz]
They
seem
super
interesting
but
I
’
ve
never
dove
deep
into
them
[prabipyakurel]
Some
are
constitution
related
but
what
they
did
to
get
there
is
interesting
.
[sskarz]
Wasn
’
t
there
a
president
that
had
like
a
pet
grizzly
bear
or
fought
one
😂
I
may
have
read
fake
news
on
that
but
I
thought
it
was
pretty
funny
😂
Yeahhhh
seeing
how
those
court
cases
develop
is
really
cool
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Abraham
claimed
to
ride
one
,
but
jefferson
had
2
bears
in
the
white
house
[sskarz]
I
had
a
bunch
of
those
YouTube
videos
where
they
would
explore
super
interesting
cases
That
’
s
so
cool
!
❤

[prabipyakurel]

to
someone
),
he

into
a
bathtub
and
dude
was
go
big
that
all
the
water

5D
chess

There

[sskarz]
Good
afternoon
!
👍
Yes
and
I
’
ve
tried
it
I
will
never
go
back
💀
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
,
don
'
t
go
back
,
for
the
sake
of
your
mental
health
Yes
pretty
smooth
,
it
was
really
hot
so
took
time
to
fall
asleep
,
but
we
eventually
got
there
.
You
?
[sskarz]
Yeahhhhh
the
heat
is
so
crazy
I
slept
pretty
soundly
,
I
stayed
up
and
watched
some
YouTube
videos
but
then
fell
asleep
[prabipyakurel]
cat
fan
lol
me
in
front
of
the
fan
rn
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
I
’
ve
kept
the
AC
on
like
almost
permanently
over
here
,
it
’
s
way
too
hot
👍
I
was
at
the
gym
earlier
in
the
morning
and
I
think
their
fans
stopped
working
so
everyone
started
sweating
like
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Youtube
is
fun
,
have
you
ever
watched
a
video
late
at
night
and
its
funny
,
but
you
can
'
t
laugh
because
you
will
wake
others
so
you
do
that
silent
laugh
.
😂
Oh
damn
,
the
fan
really
gave
up
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
it
’
s
so
hard
to
try
not
to
laugh
😂
Yeah
it
was
like
a
hot
sandstorm
levels
of
heat
in
there
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
how
when
summer
started
around
June
,
it
was
cold
and
stuff
and
now
that
its
almost
over
,
it
is
like
"
lets
make
this
weather
hotter
"
[sskarz]
And
it
was
like
gloomy
for
like
a
few
weeks
straight
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[sskarz]
And
it
rained
a
couple
days
ago
,
I
miss
the
rain
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
miss
the
rain
so
much
I
mean
it
can
be
inconvenient
,
but
it
feels
sooo
good
to
just
walk
out
when
its
raining
and
staying
inside
at
the
same
time
.
[sskarz]
Unrelated
but
when
I
saw
this
I
thought
about
how
you
need
this
for
bugs
💀
Frrrr
rain
is
the
best
weather
[prabipyakurel]
I
need
this
fr
Even
with
this
I
would
be
doing
it
from
a
mile
away
from
the
bug
it
really
is
[sskarz]
You
will
*
probably
*
kill
it
with
that
[prabipyakurel]
yea
that
and
anyone
else
within
the
radius
[sskarz]
the
poor
dorm
building
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
they
gonna
come
in
and
charge
me
extra
[sskarz]
They
gonna
sue
you
not
just
charge
extra
wdym
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Well
yea
ig
that
is
a
possibility
too
[sskarz]
Ok
I
have
a
dumb
question
If
you
got
into
a
scenario
where
you
have
to
stand
before
court
,
and
let
’
s
say
you
’
re
a
lawyer
,
can
you
appoint
yourself
as
your
own
lawyer
[prabipyakurel]
hmmmm
that
is
a
good
question
I
am
sure
they
can
and
I
probably
will
.
[sskarz]
it
’
s
probably
never
happened
but
it
would
be
funny
so
what
’
s
your
plan
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
really
have
any
lol
,
just
binge
watching
a
baking
show
and
I
still
have
like
40
%
of
the
course
left
,
so
just
gonna
be
going
through
that
.
You
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
gonna
be
watching
a
movie
in
about
an
hour
You
’
ve
probably
heard
of
Oppenheimer
[prabipyakurel]
omg
so
many
times
like
everywhere
Don
'
t
know
what
its
about
though
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
popular
because
it
’
s
directed
by
Christopher
Nolan
It
’
s
the
story
and
development
of
the
first
atom
bomb
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
I
always
wondered
how
they
did
that
[sskarz]
you
split
an
atom
and
kaboom
Or
something
like
that
lol
[prabipyakurel]
So
simple
[sskarz]
it
’
s
a
3
hour
movie
so
I
’
m
gonna
be
strapped
in
for
a
good
while
Praying
no
more
fire
alarms
happen
lol
[prabipyakurel]
It
probably
wont
,
but
who
knows
.
Thats
a
while
,
are
you
going
alone
?
[sskarz]
It
do
be
really
hot
outside
so
I
’
m
hoping
they
learned
from
last
time
Yup
,
I
like
going
to
the
movies
whether
I
’
m
with
friends
and
family
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
Jokes
on
them
,
they
will
probably
be
stading
outside
with
the
rest
.
[sskarz]
Yeahhh
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
anything
else
other
than
the
movie
for
today
?
[sskarz]
Uhhhhhhhhh
that
’
s
a
good
question
lol
Not
that
I
can
think
of
,
rn
I
’
m
just
chilling
in
bed
I
already
did
all
my
tasks
in
the
morning
so
I
’
d
be
free
for
the
rest
of
the
day
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
,
i
mean
you
are
laying
down
and
watching
your
phone
so
thats
something
.
Fast
worker
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
Nah
I
just
wake
up
early
I
woke
up
at
6
today
and
got
stuff
going
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
my
eyes
opens
up
at
6
too
[sskarz]
You

up
at
6
everyday
?
[prabipyakurel]
Try
to
,
I
dont
get
off
bed
right
away
,
but
I
wake
up
.
[sskarz]
Yup
same
lol
Today
I
got
the
energy
to
get
up
and
off
earlier
than
usual
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
,
stare
at
the
ceiling
for
a
bit
and
think
about
life
.
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
it
’
s
a
staple
before
every
night
to
bed
and
when
you
wake
up
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
Thoughts
just
pop
up
and
you
just
go
"
oh
ok
"
[sskarz]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
yea
that
happens
every
once
in
a
while
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
you
sit
up
in
bed
and
then
stare
at
the
floor
for
a
good
5
minutes
,
sigh
and
get
up
It
’
s
like
that
every
morning
lol
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
so
accurate
,
like
you
dont
even
know
lol
.
Have
you
ever
had
an
alarm
to
wake
up
and
you
wake
up
to
find
like
5
minutes
before
your
alarm
goes
off
so
you
just
go
to
sleep
until
it
rings
?
[sskarz]
TOO
MANY
TIMES
LOL
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
it
was
only
me
[sskarz]
I
actually
hate
when
that
happens
[prabipyakurel]
me
too
[sskarz]
cuz
then
I
don
’
t
wanna
wake
up
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

lazy
after
that

good
songs
[sskarz]

time
and
add
songs
to

together
[prabipyakurel]
Aww

how
it
would
work
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
sure
,
but
friends
have
done
it
Maybe
they
have
premium
or
something
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
sounds
pretty
neat
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Because
I
only
listen
to
music
when
I
clean
or
have
like
a
hands
on
project
,
or
putting
some
thing
together
,
I
cant
do
schoolwork
with
music
on
,
I
need
silence
.
[sskarz]
Oh
really
?
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
listen
to
music
when
completing
school
work
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
my
go
to
is
either
soft
r
&
b
or
lofi
Usually
gets
me
in
the
mood
It
doesn
’
t
distract
me
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
cant
be
listening
to
anything
Especially
when
I
am
reading
a
book
or
smething
[sskarz]
I
get
that
tho
,
I
used
to
only
be
able
to
do
hw
in
silence
Oh
yeah
I
can
’
t
read
papers
or
books
with
music
on
I
be
getting
the
words
mixed
up
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
the
wrong
thing
when
I
listen
and
read
I
can
write
with
music
on
tho
,
that
feels
pretty
good
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
anything
but
reading
long
lines
of
text
that
needs
focus
lol
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
Have
you
watched
lucifer
?
[sskarz]
Oh
I
have
!
Idk
if
it
got
new
seasons
yet
But
I
got
to
like
season
2
or
3
I
forgot
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
yea
its
amazing
[sskarz]
Have
you
caught
up
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
rewatching
it
all
over
again
Yea
finished
it
all
the
way
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
I
only
remember
the
last
scene
Where
he
goes
back
into
hell
and
sits
on
a
really
tall
throne
Idk
what
season
that
ended
off
on
But
that
’
s
as
far
as
I
can
remember
The
show
was
pretty
good
tho
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
lol
really
tall
throne
[sskarz]
Speaking
of
shows
Have
you
watched
daredevil
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
I
have
seen
it
on
my
page
,
but
havent
watched
it
[sskarz]
I
know
you
’
re
not
super
into
superheroes
but
it
’
s
basically
about
a
guy
that
’
s
completely
blind
but
he
is
a
vigilante
crime
fighter
at
night
and
a
lawyer
by
day
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhh
wait
wait
I
have
heard
of
it
though
[sskarz]
So
he
solves
cases
as
a
lawyer
and
then
finds
truths
out
as
a
blind
vigilante
yes
it
’
s
a
really
good
show
I
’
d
highly
recommend
it
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
not
on
netflix
?
[sskarz]
It
should
be
That
’
s
where
I
watched
it
Ohhhhhhh
it
might
’
ve
moved
to
Disney
plus
recently
because
of
the
whole
marvel
thingy
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
thats
probably
what
happened
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
that
sucks
If
you
ever
get
to
watch
it
tho
,
trust
it
’
s
great
👍
[prabipyakurel]
you
got
it
!
[sskarz]
Also
something
incredible
just
happened
[prabipyakurel]
???
[sskarz]
So
I
just
found
out
that
some
package
is
getting
shipped
to
my
house
and
I
learned
from
an
email
.
I
traced
the
package
order
and
apparently
a
vinyl
that
I
ordered
9
MONTHS
ago
is
finally
arriving
sometime
this
month
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
thats
great
news
,
and
9
MONTHS
ago
?
lmao
[sskarz]
I
bought
this
vinyl
long
ago
because
it
was
on
backorder
and
I
really
wanted
it
,
but
it
’
s
so
rare
to
get
one
because
it
stopped
production
on
those
.
And
that
vinyl
costs
about
$
350
I
bought
it
for
$
50
For
completely
unsealed
vinyl
and
it
looked
like
it
was
on
complete
back
order
and
never
shipping
again
And
I
forgot
to
refund
it
But
apparently
they
got
one
and
sending
it
to
me
now
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
and
they
sent
it
tho
,
so
thats
good
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
was
super
surprised
[prabipyakurel]
Did
i
show
you
a
picture
of
a
wall
full
of
vinyls
at
berkeley
?
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
it
looked
so
cool
[prabipyakurel]
just
keep
adding
to
that
collection
of
yours
.
Yea
I
saw
it
and
was
like
,
wow
he
would
probably
like
this
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
oh
i
love
vinyls
and
collecting
them
my
plan
is
to
one
day
live
in
my
own
house
and
in
my
room
have
a
crazy
cool
office
with
my
custom
PC
setup
and
vinyls
on
the
walls
i
already
got
the
aesthetic
planned
out
lol
[prabipyakurel]
That
soundds
pretty
cool
.
You
will
live
that
dream
dw
,
you
got
this
.
💯
[sskarz]
hell
yeah
i
will
👍
[prabipyakurel]
That
confidence
,
damn
.
Way
to
go
[sskarz]
ofc
i
mean
i
'
ve
earned
this
level
of
confidence
lol
rewards
of
the
work
I
do
is
finally
coming
into
fruition
and
its
only
getting
better
and
better
[prabipyakurel]
And
lets
pray
that
it
only
keeps
getting
more
better
.
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
make
sure
of
it
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
vinyls
are
pretty
cool
,
I
never
knew
how
to
play
them
until
you
showed
me
a
while
back
lol
[sskarz]
yeah
I
mean
I
just
love
the
vinyl
art
cover
designs
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
were
so
pretty
[sskarz]
the
vinyl
themselves
are
really
cool
,
but
to
also
own
like
a
big
physical
copy
of
your
favorite
album
is
another
thing
❤
️
I
showed
you
my
exclusive
pink
vinyl
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
mac
miller
one
?
[sskarz]
like
that
one
is
super
pretty
oh
no
that
one
is
just
plain
black
hold
on
let
me
show
you
a
pic
This
is
my
favorite
one
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
looks
so
calming
[sskarz]
Because
the
vinyl
looks
like
this
[prabipyakurel]
such
a
pretty
lavender
color
You
probably
take
care
of
these
like
they
are
your
kids
huh
?
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
this
was
super
limited
edition
👍
Well
I
don
’
t
do
like
maintenance
but
I
make
sure
they
’
re
in
regular
room
temperature
and
safely
tucked
away
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
Idk
I
like
collecting
stuff
it
’
s
fun
[prabipyakurel]
yea
the
entire
concept
of
vinyls
sound
fun
[sskarz]
It
’
s
expensive
but
worth
it
to
me
💯
And
I
can
maintain
financial
stability
so
I
’
m
good
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
keep
collecting
.
[sskarz]
Do
you
like
to
collect
anything
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
nothing
in
particular
no
oh
wait
,
little
cars
and
hot
wheels
I
don
'
t
know
too
much
about
cars
,
but
they
are
so
cuteee
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhhhhhh
yeahhhhhhhhhhh
gotta
love
them
Like
hot
wheels
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
didnt
even
mean
to
collect
,
but
I
just
kept
them
[sskarz]
Or
like
mini
replicas
[prabipyakurel]
replicas
[sskarz]
that
’
s
so
sick
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
not
like
obsessed
or
anything
,
but
its
just
there
and
I
dust
them
every
once
in
a
while
.
👍
Hey
you
are
probably
about
to
head
out
,
dont
wanna
keep
you
busy
,
you
should
get
going
.
👍
Tell
me
how
the
movie
goes
,
I
will
talk
to
you
after
you
are
done
!
[sskarz]
For
sure
!
I
’
ll
talk
to
you
later
:)
👋
Yeah
so
I
just
finished
watching
Oppenheimer
and
as
you
saw
my
story
,
I
thought
it
was
amazing
Those
were
the
fastest
3
hours
I
swear
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
glad
you
were
able
to
watch
it
without
the
fire
alarm
lol
.
[sskarz]
yeah
I
think
you
’
d
like
the
movie
too
There
’
s
a
LOT
of
politics
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
very
very
interesting
👍
Twists
and
turns
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
it
when
there
is
like
the
biggest
plot
twist
in
movies
[sskarz]
The
feeling
I
got
from
watching
that
movie
is
like
if
you
were
peering
into
a
history
book
in
visual
form
,
and
you
were
actually
living
in
their
time
WW2
to
Cold
War
era
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
so
cool
That
must
have
felt
amazing
[sskarz]
And
I
think
this
movie
is
even
more
enjoyable
especially
if
you
know
the
specific
history
behind
the
atom
bomb
and
Oppenheimer
Yeah
it
was
incredible
Very
historically
accurate
[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
amazing
!
[sskarz]
I
will
say
tho
it
is
rated
R
for
a
reason
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
because
its
gory
or
...
[sskarz]
it
’
s
not
gore
,
it
’
s
nudity
2
scenes
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
i
see
[sskarz]
But
thankfully
not
emphasized
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
some
movies
are
really
like
that
like
they
could
have
no
added
it
,
but
its
just
a
few
scenes
that
make
it
kinda
weird
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
It
was
to
portray
a
different
side
of
a
character
which
I
get
it
but
still
lol
But
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
that
makes
sense
[sskarz]
The
story
is
told
in
a
genius
way
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
like
1st
person
or
3rd
person
?
[sskarz]
Without
spoiling
,
it
’
s
told
from
beginning
and
end
at
the
same
time
If
that
makes
sense
You
see
the
aftermath
of
actions
and
then
you
’
ll
see
what
led
up
to
that
point
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
[sskarz]
Like
you
knew
the
ending
when
the
movie
already
had
started
,
it
’
s
just
the
feeling
of
wonder
of
how
it
all
came
to
be
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
like
that
[sskarz]
which
is
just
fascinating
[prabipyakurel]
So
basically
what
led
up
to
it
[sskarz]
Mhmm
[prabipyakurel]
nice
nice
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
could
talk
more
about
it
but
there
is
just
so
much
that
would
spoil
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
mean
idk
when
I
would
actually
watch
it
so
,
its
probably
fine
why
did
you
give
it
9
.
5
out
of
10
,
why
not
10
?
[sskarz]
Very
specific
parts
of
the
movie
felt
unnecessary
Not
too
many
,
just
a
few
scenes
felt
like
it
didn
’
t
need
explaining
or
they
went
into
it
too
much
without
it
amounting
to
much
[prabipyakurel]
oooo
lol
,
I
was
like
damn
he
was
so
specific
with
that
last
point
.
[sskarz]
Everything
else
tho
[prabipyakurel]
I
understand
[sskarz]
Just
amazing
👏
And
the
cinematography
and
motifs
behind
certain
camera
shots
and
color
choices
Like
there
’
s
a
section
of
the
movie
that
’
s
just
in
black
and
white
and
having
to
figure
out
why
it
’
s
portrayed
in
such
a
way
it
’
s
incredible
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
some
people
put
a
lot
of
effort
in
movies
and
it
shows
[sskarz]
So
many
hidden
meanings
behind
character
motives
and
their
ambitions
for
their
actions
[prabipyakurel]
its
like
a
hidden
mystery
[sskarz]
Yeah
It
is
super
cryptic
at
times
Like
when
politics
gets
involved
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
[sskarz]
It
’
s
very
political
heavy
like
80
%
of
the
movie
Because
it
exists
in
the
time
of
Hitler
and
the
communist
party
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
a
big
percentage
,
i
mean
its
based
on
the
atomic
bomb
so
I
assume
it
would
be
involved
in
politics
.
Damn
hitler
[sskarz]
OHHHH
dude
I
felt
so
smart
one
time
So
Oppenheimer
was
writing
a
bunch
of
formulas
on
the
board
and
calculating
the
physics
behind
neutrons
and
how
they
move
and
stuff
And
I
actually
recognized
a
couple
formulas
from
my
physics
class
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
[sskarz]
And
I
was
like
OHHHHH
that
’
s
dope
Like
the
rotation
formulas
,
the
formula
for
energy
[prabipyakurel]
The
moment
hits
different
when
you
rememebr
something
you
learned
in
school
si
applied
in
real
life
.
👍
I
literally
don
'
t
recall
this
You
are
like
an
actual
genius
if
you
remembered
a
physics
formula
lol
I
can
see
why
you
felt
smart
!
[sskarz]
I
blame
my
physics
professor
,
he
practically
burned
them
inside
my
cornea
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
shout
out
to
him
[sskarz]
Oh
hell
naw
that
guy
deserves
the
worst
💀
Jk
jk
I
just
don
’
t
like
physics
But
I
know
it
[prabipyakurel]
skills
dang
,
what
did
he
do
to
you
?
[sskarz]
Well
for
starters
he
gave
us
double
the
tests
compared
to
other
professors
And
our
class
had
an
average
percentage
of
35
%
on
each
test
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
I
hate
teachers
that
assign
tests
[sskarz]
For
perspective
,
my
highest
test
scores
was
a
B
-
I
ended
with
an
A
when
he
rounded
our
grades
But
still
[prabipyakurel]
I
manages
to
pass
with
A
for
both
semesters
but
it
was
like
a
92
[sskarz]
He
did
that
at
the
LAST
DAY
of
class
[prabipyakurel]
I
barely
made
it
[sskarz]
Same
I
ended
with
a
90
💀
Literally
on
the
edge
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
good
for
physics
tho
I
just
didnt
want
my
GPA
to
drop
than
the
previous
year
dont
like
going
home
with
that
face
So
I
was
like
praying
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
must
’
ve
been
scary
My
grade
in
my
physics
class
was
a
C
+
till
the
last
day
when
he
rounded
everyone
’
s
grade
up
Most
people
failed
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
the
GPA
would
have
stayed
above
4
,
but
still
feels
so
bad
to
know
you
were
just
a
few
points
off
[sskarz]
100
%
I
get
that
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
cruel
dude
,
waited
till
the
last
day
I
hope
that
professors
do
the
same
to
his
kids
lol
[sskarz]
Yeah
we
all
begged
to
him
as
a
class
and
he
would
always
make
fake
promises
Like
he
always
said
he
’
d
round
tests
but
he
never
did
Till
the
last
day
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
mines
was
mean
but
he
was
really
nice
at
the
same
time
He
used
to
chase
the
football
players
around
and
teach
them
how
physics
worked
by
physically
demonstrating
on
them
[sskarz]
Wtf
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
told
them
to
hit
him
or
like
throw
a
ball
across
to
someone
in
the
room
to
prove
a
point
but
he
loved
to
talk
about
video
games
and
anime
and
like
during
tests
he
would
let
us
write
whatever
notes
we
could
fit
in
a
index
card
.
I
would
write
so
small
on
those
[sskarz]
oh
you
gotta
that
reminds
me
my
friend
outsmarted
my
professor
on
those
like
cheat
index
cards
by
writing
out
his
notes
on
a
tablet
,
shrinking
it
,
and
then
printing
it
on
the
index
card
worked
like
a
charm
and
the
professor
had
no
say
on
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
that
is
so
clever
Yea
my
brain
doesnt
think
of
those
things
I
literally
wrote
like
everything
out
[sskarz]
definitely
steal
his
idea
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Well
if
I
am
able
to
do
that
for
college
yes
[sskarz]
so
how
'
s
your
day
been
so
far
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
am
at
the
last
part
of
my
alcohol
course
,
made
roti
to
eat
with
veggies
for
dinner
,
cleaned
my
room
a
little
and
that
is
pretty
much
it
.
Yours
?
[sskarz]
oh
nice
nice
,
remember
don
'
t
drink
alcohol
too
much
otherwise
bad
things
happen
👍
i
'
ve
been
enlightened
by
the
movie
👍
but
also
i
got
a
haircut
early
in
the
day
and
it
went
well
so
im
happy
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
for
the
advice
dude
,
you
speaking
from
experience
?
[sskarz]
nope
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
was
it
like
a
normal
haircut
or
like
one
of
those
fancy
one
[sskarz]
nah
i
keep
it
simple
always
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
No
because
some
people
go
crazy
with
haircuts
[sskarz]
is
it
just
me
or
does
like
every
person
have
a
specific
barber
i
just
go
to
my
local
haircut
place
and
they
cut
it
simple
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
that
is
my
dad
[sskarz]
idk
if
im
the
odd
one
out
on
that
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
he
goes
all
the
way
to
alhambra
to
one
asian
lady
and
gets
it
done
No
no
you
arent
for
me
I
only
go
like
once
in
a
while
to
trimm
my
hair
,
so
it
changes
but
for
my
brother
and
dad
,
its
the
same
.
[sskarz]
do
you
like
to
keep
your
hair
long
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
not
too
long
just
enough
to
be
able
to
look
good
with
hair
down
and
be
able
to
tie
it
when
needed
[sskarz]
damn
seems
like
i
need
to
find
one
specific
too
lol
ah
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
think
its
because
they
know
how
the
person
wants
it
[sskarz]
that
'
s
true
but
they
be
going
like
every
week
[prabipyakurel]
like
my
dad
gets
the
same
type
of
haircut
like
everytime
Totally
normal

see
the
parts
you
might
have
missed
.
And
barbie
is
great
,
its
pretty
interesting
.
I
do
that
when
I
have
too
much
work
and
don
'
t
know
where
to
start
or
when
something
is
wrong
with
the
computer

yesterday

[prabipyakurel]
Good

Yea
sleep
was
pretty
peaceful
yesterday
and
my
day
was
average
,
nothing
too
interesting
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
I
slept
pretty
late
and
I
'
ve
just
been
in
a
rush
this
morning
to
prepare
for
my
parents
coming
back
tomorrow
lol
cleaning
the
house
and
backyard
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
it
must
feel
pretty
good
knowing
they
are
coming
back
.
Is
it
like
really
messy
or
ok
?
[sskarz]
yeah
I
miss
them
,
glad
they
'
re
finally
coming
back
It
'
s
not
super
messy
,
just
had
to
put
stuff
in
order
and
do
a
deep
clean
of
the
house
so
what
'
s
your
plan
for
today
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
put
music
and
get
scrubbing
.
[sskarz]
already
did
haha
made
it
go
much
quicker
[prabipyakurel]
Uh
one
of
my
friends
messaged
me
at
12
:
40
this
morning
asking
me
how
to
write
an
argumentative
essay
and
I
dont
know
if
he
read
the
story
yet
or
not
,
so
probably
gonna
help
him
.
Other
than
that
we
shall
see
.
Yep
music
always
helps
.
[sskarz]
oh
whaaaaaat
does
he
have
like
summer
class
or
something
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
,
maybe
I
am
not
too
sure
He
is
going
to
PCC
so
maybe
they
start
earlier
or
something
[sskarz]
nah
I
have
a
friend
at
PCC
and
he
hasn
'
t
started
his
semester
yet
[prabipyakurel]
hmm
interesting
[sskarz]
probably
summer
class
[prabipyakurel]
probably
[sskarz]
he
probably
stayed
up
all
night
trying
to
write
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
he
is
not
that
type
trust
me
👍
Do
you
have
any
plans
today
?
[sskarz]
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
my
friends
wanted
to
go
watch
oppenheimer
so
I
might
join
them
,
but
i
just
found
out
that
the
theater
is
like
completely
packed
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
right
[sskarz]
so
I
'
m
trying
to
figure
something
out
[prabipyakurel]
I
forgot
Maybe
like
some
other
place
has
spots
Some
of
my
friends
went
and
watched
both
yesterday
They
called
it
barbenheimer
😂
[sskarz]
yeah
its
a
trend
where
you
watch
both
on
the
same
day
back
to
back
because
you
go
from
super
happy
and
funny
to
peering
into
a
mind
of
complex
emotions
and
internal
battles
and
its
just
jarring
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
probably
gonna
feel
weird
transitioning
from
barbie
with
all
that
pink
and
stuff
to
like
wars
and
battles
lol
[sskarz]
well
its
not
wars
,
its
just
about
a
guy
that
made
the
best
and
worst
thing
mankind
had
ever
seen
did
your
friends
like
oppenheimer
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
loved
it
,
said
it
was
amazing
[sskarz]
100
%
christopher
nolan
'
s
magnum
opus
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
said
it
was
worth
the
3
hours
[sskarz]
i
was
ready
for
it
to
be
6
hours
the
3
hours
go
by
so
fast
👍
[prabipyakurel]
So
you
finished
deep
cleaning
and
everything
?
[sskarz]
yeah
I
'
m
just
sitting
at
my
desk
and
sorting
stuff
out
on
my
daily
planner
oh
I
wanted
to
show
you
something
😂
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
my
sisters
Starbucks
order
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
I
thought
yours
was
a
lot
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
give
her
the
guiness
world
record
of
longest
starbucks
order
LOL
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
very
specific
[sskarz]
yea
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
messing
up
on
one
of
those
,
think
she
would
notice
and
be
like
there
are
only
3
pumps
of
something
.
Quite
and
order
[sskarz]
oh
they
always
miss
something
on
these
really
long
orders
mhmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
if
I
was
working
and
that
order
came
in
,
I
would
forget
half
of
it
automatically
.
[sskarz]
yeah
and
it
was
super
busy
over
there
I
feel
bad
for
the
workers
they
have
to
juggle
so
many
orders
at
once
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
always
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
on
.
I
have
never
had
a
list
,
I
just
look
at
the
menu
and
order
whatever
feels
right
for
the
day
and
pick
a
size
.
[sskarz]
same
I
went
with
a
matcha
frappe
nothing
else
added
lol
its
so
hot
outside
[prabipyakurel]
uhhh
...
matcha
[sskarz]
i
swear
its
like
an
oven
[prabipyakurel]
an
industrial
size
[sskarz]
I
forgot
you
'
re
not
a
fan
of
matcha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep
,
its
not
the
worst
thing
,
but
I
would
prefer
other
things
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fair
[prabipyakurel]
Also
you
keep
a
planner
?
Thats
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
yeah
I
try
to
organize
my
ideas
and
tasks
that
I
need
to
get
done
because
I
swear
I
have
like
mini
ADHD
where
I
just
forget
things
I
need
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
always
try
to
create
like
a
planner
online
and
the
notebook
onee
,
and
after
like
a
few
days
,
I
give
up
on
it
and
it
remains
somewhere
in
my
room
.
I
write
everything
down
on
my
whiteboard
so
its
in
front
of
me
when
I
wake
up
lol
That
happens
to
me
too
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
I
wanted
to
do
the
same
thing
with
like
a
white
board
[prabipyakurel]
likee
everyday
for
everything
yea
its
not
like
those
aesthetic
looking
ones
,
its
like
ugly
fr
.
[sskarz]
same
😂
I
use
an
online
planner
on
my
phone
so
I
can
'
t
mess
it
up
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
write
slanted
so
when
I
write
straight
on
anything
,
it
looks
wonky
Yep
been
there
too
,
didnt
work
deleted
the
thing
in
like
2
days
[sskarz]
oh
rip
💀
I
'
ve
tried
so
many
planners
and
none
of
them
worked
out
as
long
as
the
one
I
'
m
using
right
now
👍
[prabipyakurel]
But
its
cool
that
you
manage
life
like
that
I
could
never
[sskarz]
I
have
to
,
otherwise
I
will
never
get
anything
done
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
you
I
just
got
into
the
habit
of
using
reminders
for
my
planner
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
the
app
is
pretty
good
on
its
own
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
I
have
struggled
with
deadlines
like
all
my
life
so
trying
to
fix
that
up
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
dw
,
you
are
not
the
only
one
,
I
sometimes
wait
till
last
minute
I
can
'
t
spell
,
i
swear
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
mood
😂

OMG

love
that
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I
write
like
everything
on
that
there
is
no
point
of
living

[prabipyakurel]
for
now
because

[sskarz]
the

[prabipyakurel]

it
to
learn
Korean
I
really
wanna

it
for
when
I
get
to
go
to
Seoul
and
its
one
of
the
easier
languages
to
learn
in
the
world
[prabipyakurel]
Korean
does
seem
interesting
,
go
for
it
,
if
it
interests
you
then
you
can
probably
do
it
.
Can
you
say
anything
right
now
in
korean
?
[sskarz]
god
no
💀
but
I
do
want
to
learn
its
on
my
list
of
long
term
things
to
do
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
thats
alright
,
you
will
get
there
Watch
in
like
a

you
will
be
saying
things
in
korean
and
imma
be
looking

up
in
google

[sskarz]
assuming
I
actually
get

do
[prabipyakurel]

️
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Glad

that
thinks
that
life
is
like
moving
faster
than
it
should
.
😵
‍
💫
Um
maybe
,
sorry
it
took
me
a
while
to

,
Arabic
maybe
.
[sskarz]
ooooooh
that
'
s
a
good
choice
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
seems
complicated
,
its
not
at
my
to
do
as
of
now
,
but
as
soon
as
life
is
going
normally
and
I
have
time
to

rationally
,
I
might
do
it

Can

[prabipyakurel]

be
counting
it
in
my
resume
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

be
putting

dumb

of
age
and
we
need
to
breathe
oxygen
to
stay
alive
[prabipyakurel]
I
couldn

:
O

what
if
[sskarz]
imagine
OH
did
you
hear
that
court
hearing
where
aliens
were
confirmed
or
something
like
that
that
we
'
ve
seen
non
human
bodies
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yes
it
was
the
most
interesting
thing
on
the
news
[sskarz]
yeah
it
was
wild
people
were
freaking
out
about
it
on
twitter
i
'
m
like
hmmmm
i
'
m
not
surprised
[prabipyakurel]
ik
,
do
you
believe
in
aliens
?
[sskarz]
but
at
the
same
time
that
'
s
cool
other
forms
of
life
,
yeah
of
course
[prabipyakurel]
its
something
to
think
about
for
sure
[sskarz]
the
chances
that
we
'
re
the
only
living
conscious
is
astronimically
low
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
,
I
feel
like
there
are
other
forms
of
life
out
there
,
but
don
'
t
really
think
that
there
are
UFO
or
that
the
life
looks
like
the
aliens
that
we
think
of
rn
.
they
dont
look
like
this
I
am
assuming
[sskarz]
yeah
100
%
goofy
ahh
gif
💀
💀
[prabipyakurel]
You
remember
when
this
thing
was
an
internet
sensation
right
?
[sskarz]

it
was
so
dumb
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
it
was
a
little
cringy
,
like
who
wants
to
dance
like
that
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
truly
disturbing
[sskarz]
LOL

called
howard

a
meme

Hi

good
afternoon
!
Thanks
,
slept
pretty
well
.
As
for
my
day
,
I
helped
my
friend
write
a
rhetorical
analysis
essay
and
got
through
a
30
episode
drama
(
40
min
each
)
all
today
only
to
find
out
that
the
last
episode
is
getting
released
next
week
.
[sskarz]
THE
LAST
EPISODE
NOOOOOOO
that
’
s
actually
tragic
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
I
know
,
I
was
devastated
.
[sskarz]
Good
on
you
for
helping
your
friend
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
he
was
taking
summer
classes
at
PCC
so
he
wouldn
'
t
have
to
take
it
during
the
year
.
[sskarz]
I
literally
am
finally
sitting
down
since
I
woke
up
in
the
morning
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
.
Have
a
long
day
?
[sskarz]
Had
the
5
hour
class
in
the
morning
,
then
dropped
off
Amazon
return
stuff
,
then
picked
up
lunch
,
then
picked
up
parents
from
LAX
I
’
m
exhausted
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
,
but
you
got
through
it
.
[sskarz]
Still
got
a
movie
to
watch
later
tonight
and
a
dinner
to
go
to
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
imagine
lol
[sskarz]
Crazy
day
[prabipyakurel]
But
those
are
not
stressful
,
hope
you
have
fun
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
The
day
has
gone
by
so
so
quickly
Tyyyyy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
some
days
be
like
that
.
What
time
do
you
start
teaching
?
[sskarz]
9
am
but
I
have
to
get
ready
by
8
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
early
,
gotta
remember
so
I
dont
ever
text
you
early
saturday
morning
and
disturb
you
lol
.
And
it
goes
up
to
2
?
[sskarz]
Hahaha
I
mean
it
won
’
t
matter
,
my
phone
is
set
to
do
not
disturb
at
that
time
so
you
’
re
good
lol
👍
Class
ends
at
1
but
usually
people
have
questions
and
need
help
so
it
goes
till
2
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
.
[sskarz]
I
was
like
dying
I
caught
one
of
my
students
cheating
and
now
I
’
m
just
wondering
what
to
do
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
Like
on
an
exam
type
or
something
else
?
[sskarz]
Nope
on
their
homework
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
does
the
kid
know
that
you
know
?
[sskarz]
He
used
an
AI
to
do
it
for
him
and
I
confirmed
it
,
but
the
problem
is
that
he
’
s
actually
really
smart
and
one
of
the
best
students
in
the
class
,
he
’
s
just
lazy
Nope
Not
yet
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
well
maybe
ask
him
privately
how
he
is
doing
and
he
is
struggling
anywhere
.
[sskarz]
I
doubt
he
’
s
struggling
with
anything
Tbh
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
[sskarz]
He
did
almost
perfectly
today
on
the
kahoot
quiz
today
And
he
usually
does
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
he
was
just
lazy
,
maybe
if
he
repeats
it
,
you
can
talk
to
him
.
[sskarz]
And
I
know
he
’
s
capable
because
I
had
him
as
a
student
last
year
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
students
then
too
True
Idk
never
thought
I
’
d
be
in
this
position
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
then
I
am
sure
that
they
will
be
fine
,
don
'
t
stress
about
it
,
but
if
it
keeps
happening
maybe
confronting
him
about
why
he
is
doing
so
is
probably
the
best
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
just
don
’
t
want
him
to
rely
on
that
for
everything
for
his
own
sake
There
comes
a
time
where
even
AI
gets
certain
things
wrong
with
enough
complexity
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
stress
too
much
about
it
,
I
am
sure
you
will
figure
out
something
.
Yep
I
understand
,
too
much
AI
is
never
good
.
[sskarz]
Yepppp
This
wasn
’
t
a
problem
last
year
💀
Technology
moves
so
quickly
it
’
s
awesome
but
also
scary
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
its
alright
,
and
you
are
a
very
nice
and
kind
person
,
I
am
sure
if
you
explain
and
tell
them
why
its
bad
,
they
won
'
t
do
it
again
.
❤
️
Technology
is
moving
wayyyyyyyy
to
fast
ngl
.
[sskarz]
Frrrrrrrr
I
appreciate
your
words
:),
will
do
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
you
got
this
!
[sskarz]
Something
big
comes
out
every
week
and
it
’
s
like
woahhhhhhhh
I
was
just
digesting
the
last
thing
Do
u
think
we
’
d
ever
be
like
under
the
dangers
of
rogue
AI
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
,
quite
often
actually
.
I
feel
like
there
needs
to
be
a
limit
to
technology
and
how
we
are
advancing
it
.
I
mean
yes
we
need
to
improve
and
have
advanced
technology
,
but
there
are
things
that
don
'
t
need
technology
and
can
be
left
alone
.
AI
is
messing
with
everyone
and
everything
in
one
way
or
another
lol
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
getting
a
little
too
good
at
certain
things
lol
I
agree
I
think
it
should
be
limited
from
its
actual
crazy
potential
[prabipyakurel]
I
kind
of
miss
when
there
was
just
enough
technology
,
like
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
.
fr
[sskarz]
Like
the
2010
era
?
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
a
little
ahead
[sskarz]
2016
ish
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
when
1st
graders
aren
'
t
introduced
to
laptops
and
such
.
About
there
.
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
Crazy
Kindergartners
are
getting
phones
and
it
’
s
like
whaaaaaaat
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
ikr
So
when
I
left
my
elementary
school
,
8th
grade
,
there
was
this
little
girl
and
her
name
was
Shirley
and
she
was
cute
and
small
like
probably
in
kinder
or
so
,
and
like
I
was
going
home
from
school
and
she
was
walking
with
like
4
other
girls
,
they
are
like
2nd
graders
,
with
phones
and
making
tiktoks
I
was
like
🤯
[sskarz]
That
is
insane
Why
are
they
on
TikTok
that
is
actually
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
Its
not
doing
good
,
especially
for
the
upcoming
generations
.
[sskarz]
the
attention
span
of
the
next
generation
about
to
be
records
low
I
swear
[prabipyakurel]
They
will
be
in
a
friendship
circle
and
be
texting
instead
of
talking
.
[sskarz]
That
is
WILD
[prabipyakurel]
Technology
is
scary
and
I
am
sure
that
there
is
more
to
come
.
[sskarz]
we
really
are
moving
towards
that
Wall
E
universe
aren
’
t
we
💀
[prabipyakurel]
We
are
all
gonna
be
like
people
that
need
technology
to
function
and
gonna
fall
apart
without
it
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
’
d
rather
that
over
the
terminator
being
real
sooooooo
[prabipyakurel]
True
true
Did
you
watch
barbenheimer
yesterday
?
[sskarz]
Nah

to
watch
Oppenheimer

with
my
homies
The
showing
is
at
10
:
30
💀
I
’
m
gonna
drop
dead
in
the
halfway
point
of
the
movie
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
late
late
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
But
they
really
wanted
to
see
it
and
I
wanted
to
watch
it
again
But
now
that
I
’
m
sitting
here
,
I
could
really
go
for
a
nap
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

very
old
,

old
age
hitting
you
.
💀

💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

a
nap

stay
awake
.
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
have
a
dinner
to
attend
to
soon
and
I
’
m
like

The
introvert
is

over
[prabipyakurel]
Are

to
movies
straight
after
dinner
.
[sskarz]
Yup

that

Yea

the
way
to
dinner

you
aren

[sskarz]
WELL

.
Its
Beautiful

50
dollars
like
9
months
ago
And
it
finally
got
back
in
stock
and
actually

[prabipyakurel]
That

time

[sskarz]

😂
ALSOOOOOO

Introvert

[prabipyakurel]
Bummer

nap
before
the
movie
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
supposed
to
mimic
Picasso
’
s
art
[prabipyakurel]
Imagine
you
are
watching
oppenheimer
with
your
friends
and
you
fall
asleep
on
their
shoulders
or
something
.
Ahh
cool
.
[sskarz]
Oh
nah
the
way
they
would
slap
me
loud
asf
in
the
theater
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
do
that
too
.
💀
[sskarz]
you
’
re
one
of
the
good
ones
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
if
someone
is
going
to
come
watch
a
movie
,
they
better
be
awake
or
they
can
leave
.
[sskarz]
Hey
but
I
’
ve
already
seen
it
You
can
cut
me
some
slack
if
I
rest
just
a
bit
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmm
ig
ig
[sskarz]
I
still
have
Barbie
to
watch
and
finish
mission
impossible
and
I
’
m
looking
at
my
calendar
like
[prabipyakurel]
omg

you
start
snoring
💀
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
you

time
before
uni
starts
so

[sskarz]
Thank
god
I
’
m

my
dad
AHHHHHHHH
[prabipyakurel]
You
don
'
t
snore
?
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
wanna
go
:(
No
but
everyone
else
snores
like
CRAZY
I
got
lucky
with
the
recessive
genes
[prabipyakurel]
I
understand
,
like
my
parents
start
snoring
the
moment
they
put
their
heads
down
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
always
the
brown
parents
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
recessive
genes
always
,
and
when
we
tell
them
we
can
hear
them
snoring
from
the
hallway
they
be
like
"
stop
over
reacting
"
😂
[sskarz]
I
got
a
101
%
in
high
school
biology
what
’
s
up
I
still
remember
punnet
square
😂
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
the
only
part
of
bio
I
enjoyed
and
understood
.
Everything
is
like
dead
[sskarz]
Honestly
biology
>
chemistry
imo
Except
for
dissecting
frogs
as
my
final
That
was
traumatic
It
really
be
like
that
for
everyone
😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
’
ve
heard
people
had
to
dissect
pigs
instead
of
frogs
so
I
consider
myself
lucky
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
I
actually
enjoyed
chem
more
,
maybe
because
it
was
over
online
learning
and
all
the
tests
were
open
notes
.
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
100
%
LOL
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
dissecting
anything
is
gross
[sskarz]
My
parents
used
to
be
like
U
should
’
ve
been
a
neuro
surgeon
cuz
it
was
in
my
cheena
(
the
future
predicting
scroll
thing
idk
how
to
spell
it
)
Did
you
ever
get
yours
told
?
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
thing
SOOOOOO
many
times
they
like
your
cheena
predicted
this
and
that
[sskarz]
FRRRR
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
even
know
how
the
hell
it
works
[sskarz]
Crazy
stuff
I
don
’
t
believe
in
it
religiously
or
anything
but
it
’
s
fun
to
think
about
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
sure
the
last
time
I
heard
that
they
misplaced
mines
and
were
like
freaking
out
I
feel
like
its
nothing
religious
,
just
like
horoscopes
stuff
[sskarz]
Yeah
Was
yours
a
good
cheena
?
If
you
’
re
fine
with
sharing
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
they
said
it
was
good
and
that
I
would
be
successful
.
❤
️
Don
'
t
remember
too
much
tbh
Yours
?
[sskarz]
Hell
yeah
!
that
’
s
right
💯💯💯💯
Around
the
same
as
yours
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
thanks
but
that
is
something
we
gonna
find
out
later
on
,
if
its
true
.
[sskarz]
Don
’
t
need
to
find
out
,
already
seen

❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
sweet
,
we
both
got
this
,
lets
be
successful
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
Honestly
my
cheena
was
a
bit
weird
,
it
did
predict
a
lot
of
crazy
things
Like
my
scar
accident
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
it
keeps
turning
true
then
life
is
gonna
be
wild
when
I
graduate
college
[prabipyakurel]
Why
,
is
it
something
bad
?
[sskarz]
No
it
’
s
insanely
good
actually
Which
scares
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
if
its
good
,
then
you
are
fine
.
[sskarz]
So
I
try
not
to
get
my
head
wrapped
in
it
too
much
gotta
stay
focused
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
DW
you
got
this
,
and
that
cheena
is
probably
right
.
You
gonna
be
the
next
bill
gates
.
[sskarz]
Me
manifesting
it
every
day
:
Oh
hell

[sskarz]
Hey
good
morning
!
How
was
your
day
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
Good
Morning
!
Yesterday
was
quite
busy
,
I
drove
for
quite
a
while
and
got
that
practice
in
.
And
ended
off
with
dinner
at
cousins
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Oh
nice
!
Yeah
it
’
s
good
to
get
some
quality
driving
practice
in
,
hopefully
you
’
re
feeling
a
little
more
comfortable
around
the
roads
Basically
just
prepared
for
next
weeks
class
and
a
bunch
of
chores
and
stuff
I
worked
and
then
napped
and
worked
then
went
to
sleep
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
a
little
more
comfortable
,
I
got
scolded
by
dad
for
going
through
the
wrong
side
and
parking
in
a
parking
lot
.
Nice
nice
It
was
like
on
and
off
huh
.
[sskarz]
Like
80
%
on
and
20
%
off
😂
I
told
my
dad
to
take
a
day
off
but
he
insisted
so
we
just
got
to
doing
everything
yesterday
RIP
like
you
went
into
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
?
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
know
when
you
enter
a
parking
lot
there
are
arrows
indicating
which
way
you
go
,
yea
I
went
in
the
right
way
and
was
supposed
to
park
on
the
parallel
side
,
but
i
turned
left
to
the
opposing
side
.
Realized
the
front
of
the
car
went
in
but
back
of
the
car
would
have
hit
the
other
parked
car
.
Idk
if
that
makes
sense
.
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhhhh
Were
the
parking
spots
kind
of
angled
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
those
diagonal
ones
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
it
’
s
supposed
to
help
you
park
if
you
park
in
the
right
direction
So
if
you
’
re
going
straight
and
the
arrow
says
to
go
straight
,
then
the
spots
on
the
right
are
your
spots
usually
👍
Sometimes
they
have
2
arrows
per
lane
and
that
separates
both
sides
[prabipyakurel]
Exaclty
,
and
me
being
me
turned
to
the
spot
on
the
left
.
😂
Ahhh
gotcha
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
happens
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
have
seen
my
dad
'
s
face
,
he
called
me
idiot
in
every
nepali
word
he
could
think
of
.
💀
[sskarz]
Glad
to
see
it
’
s
not
just
my
dad
either
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
am
sure
you
didn
'
t
make
as
much
mistakes
.
[sskarz]
Oh
please
I
made
so
many
he
would
often
take
control
of
the
steering
wheel
And
then
curse
me
in
every
language
he
knew
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Relatable
[sskarz]
Good
times
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
gonna
miss
these
moments
for
sure
[sskarz]
Spend
some
quality
time
with
your
sibling
and
parents
❤
️
It
’
s
gonna
be
hard
to
think
about
the
stuff
you
could
’
ve
done
later
down
the
road
Even
if
it
’
s
just
you
getting
yelled
at
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
geez
imma
be
crying
im
my
dorm
alone
once
they
leave
me
there
.
Yea
feels
bad
at
the
moment
,
but
as
time
passes
,
it
becomes
a
fun
memory
lol
.
[sskarz]
awwww
well
thank
goodness
we
'
re
in
the
tech
era
,
facetime
does
exist
so
you
can
keep
in
touch
that
way
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
the
only
way
lol
Facetime
is
the
best
sometimes
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
But
realizing
imma
miss
like
dashain
and
tihar
this
year
kinda
sucks
,
but
it
is
what
it
is
.
[sskarz]
oh
shoot
i
forgot
about
that
,
damn
that
sucks
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
we
will
just
talk
through
face
time
and
they
will
have
to
wait
until
I
get
back
.
[sskarz]
oh
i
forgot
to
ask
,
are
you
on
a
quarter
system
or
semester
?
[prabipyakurel]
Semester
You
are
on
semester
too
right
?
[sskarz]
yeah
i
much
prefer
semester
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
me
too
[sskarz]
the
quarter
system
just
sounds
like
its
a
summer
semester
in
terms
of
pacing
and
that
sounds
like
hell
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
your
midterms
would
be
the
week
after
classes
start
I
cannot
do
that
[sskarz]
same
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
brain
slow
,
need
time
to
process
things
.
😂
[sskarz]
if
i
had
to
explain
how
my
mind
works
,
this
is
it
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
some
people
like
it
because
they
can
pick
another
class
,
but
it
seems
inefficient
.
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
like
rats
churning
the
gears
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
got
no
one
Literally
empty
up
there
.
Moves
every
once
in
a
while
on
its
own
when
it
needs
to
lol
.
[sskarz]
it
just
sounds
horrible
idk
i
'
ve
never
liked
the
idea
of
quarter
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
people
explain
and
I
am
like
,
sorry
but
I
cannot
go
through
the
process
of
picking
new
classes
that
fast
.
[sskarz]
that
just
reminded
me
of
that
sloth
from
zootopia
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Berkeley
and
merced
are
the
only
UCs
on
semester
system
.
Just
realized
.
[sskarz]
yikes
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
true
because
i
have
a
friend
at
UC
Irvine
and
he
absolutely
hates
quarter
system
[prabipyakurel]
I
loveeeee
this
guy
[sskarz]
ikr
he
was
so
funny
[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
too
fast
and
busy
.
[sskarz]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
Sloths
are
amazing
,
they
show
how
my
life
is
.
Super
slow
lazy
.
[sskarz]
my
dream
life
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
tho
[sskarz]
i
wanted
my
summer
to
be
like
that
instead
it
was
like
this
😂
its
accurate
because
the
fire
represents
how
damn
hot
it
is
every
day
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
like
hell
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
2
brain
cells
and
they
have
had
to
work
overtime
without
extra
pay
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
to
hear
you
have
at
least
2
💀

brain
is

Have
you
ever
had
that
feeling
when

a
day
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
like
,
"
I
could
have
done
something

".
[sskarz]

source
but
i
heard
that

because
they
can
forget
about
breathing
[prabipyakurel]
damn
[sskarz]
like
they
are
so
lazy

what
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
It
had
like
these
pearls
in
it
instead
of
rice
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhhh
i
'
ve
seen
it
before
,
but
i
haven
'
t
tried
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
you
got
to
try
it
Really
good
.
[sskarz]
looks
pretty
good
i
'
ll
try
it
if
i
see
it
again
👍
[prabipyakurel]
How
was
your
dinner
?
[sskarz]
it
was
good
,
finally
had
some
fresh
dinner
made
by
my
mom
in
a
really
long
time
lol
i
got
so
tired
of
eating
out
or
eating
some
food
she
stored
weeks
prior
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
lol
yea
eventually
take
out
becomes
too
much
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
and
it
costs
too
much
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
fr
,
sometimes
its
better
to
just
make
something
at
home
.
[sskarz]
i
did
make
some
food
but
i
can
only
do
so
much
lol
i
'
m
not
that
experienced
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
what
my
mom
is
afraid
of
.
She
thinks
imma
forget
to
eat
rice
and
stuff
over
there
and
stick
to
fast
food
.
Nah
its
alright
,
I
can
only
make
a
few
dishes
as
well
,
I
am
sure
your
cooking
is
fine
.
[sskarz]
its
so
easy
to
get
sick
of
food
not
just
from
fast
food
,
but
everything
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
yea
once
you
have
something
,
you
need
to
at
least
give
it
a
week
before
having
it
again
.
[sskarz]
yeah
i
was
so
tired
after
the
first
week
lol
and
it
went
on
for
like
a
month
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
and
its
home
made
food
,
that
hits
different
.
[sskarz]
frrrr
and
its
way
cheaper
to
make
😂
the
way
my
bank
account
was
crying
😂
[prabipyakurel]
And
that
is
another
good
reason
[sskarz]
wait
did
your
dorm
have
a
kitchen
?
i
think
they
usually
do
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
no
kitchen
or
sink
[sskarz]
not
even
a
public
kitchen
?
[prabipyakurel]
there
is
a
kitchen
at
the
bottom
of
the
building
but
its
for
like
100
+
people
to
use
Not
clean
[sskarz]
ah
yeah
that
'
s
true
[prabipyakurel]
We
got
a
microwave
and
mini
fridge
to
share
tho
[sskarz]
that
'
s
nice
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
got
a
big
water
bottle
that
will
hopefully
fit
in
there
and
keep
my
water
cold
.
[sskarz]
oooo
like
a
hydro
flask
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
the
half
gallon
one
Keep
getting
scolded
for
not
drinking
enough
water
.
[sskarz]
but
those
are
so
good
to
keep
your
water
cold
,
the
ice
stays
for
so
long
hydro
check
,
drink
water
now
im
gonna
drink
some
as
well
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
'
t
even
get
through
a
normal
hydroflask
size
water
bottle
though
the
day
.
[sskarz]
oh
you
gotta
👍
its
important
to
keep
yourself
hydrated
a
thing
i
do
that
helps
with
me
stay
hydrated
is
like
keeping
my
water
bottle
in
my
line
of
sight
so
it
just
makes
me
more
obligated
to
drink
more
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
really
gotta
start
doing
that
Thanks
.
I
just
forget
,
like
it
goes
through
my
mind
.
[sskarz]
it
happens
but
it
is
pretty
important
for
health
now
that
i
think
about
it
,
have
you
heard
anything
about
your
dorm
mate
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
no
actually
,
have
no
idea
who
I
will
be
with
.
My
friend
is
trying
because
she
doesnt
like
her
housing
location
.
But
they
can
only
take
so
many
requests
.
[sskarz]
aw
damn
was
she
already
denied
or
just
straight
ignored
[prabipyakurel]
Just
ignored
lol
[sskarz]
rip
yeah
there
'
s
probably
hundreds
of
people
also
requesting
change
so
it
makes
sense
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
but
now
we
just
have
to
see
.
So
you
just
chilling
,
not
sleepy
yet
?
[sskarz]
not
really
sleepy
im
kinda
just
vibing
to
music
rn
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Not
sleepy
either
Just
laying
down
Think
about
life
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
mood
like
eveyr
night
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
ik
When
you
like
can
’
t
fall
asleep
[sskarz]
yeah
and
then
i
open
up
youtube
and
it
just
goes
away
lol
gets
exhausting
thinking
about
that
stuff
i
just
trust
things
will
be
ok
if
i
'
m
in
my
right
mind
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
that
’
s
the
way
to
go
You
ever
feel
like
you
don
’
t
know
what
you
are
doing
even
when
things
are
going
good
[sskarz]
all
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
U
were
typing
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
sorry
i
didn
'
t
know
if
you
wanted
to
type
first
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
you
go
[sskarz]
i
think
about
it
literally
everytime
something
goes
right
for
me
i
'
ve
just
come
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
'
s
not
a
point
in
thinking
about
what
could
go
wrong
if
you
can
go
in
it
with
full
confidence
because
you
'
ll
more
than
likely
succeed
more
often
with
full
confidence
than
none
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
that
’
s
pretty
good
actually
,
yea
I
need
to
start
building
more
confidence
[sskarz]
some
weird
thing
to
think
about
it
but
that
'
s
how
i
see
it
i
still
fear
the
unknown
but
its
a
lot
less
nowadays
[prabipyakurel]

.
Damn

[prabipyakurel]
Sometime

No

I
need
to
see
if
it
’
s
as
bad
as
you
are
putting
it
[sskarz]
im
down
hahaaaaaaaaaa
[prabipyakurel]
Because
your
parents
speak
fine
,
so
I
am
assuming
you
do
too
And
your
sister
speaks
really
good
So
[sskarz]
see
im
the
only
one
that
wasn
'
t
born
from
Nepal
big
difference
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
see
,
it
’
s
okay
tho
,
as
long
as
you
get
the
words
right
,
the
accent
can
be
a
little
bland
No
worries
[sskarz]
haha
well
one
thing
im
proud
of
i
don
'
t
sound
like
some
nepali
people
on
tiktok
i
'
ve
heard
so
much
worse
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
know
,
some
people
really
be
sounding
so
weird
Yes
dude
be
proud
you
understand
and
speak
,
some
white
washed
Nepali
is
probably
out
there
living
in
frechfries
and
speaking
only
English
.
😂
[sskarz]
oh
fr
yeah
i
know
some
that
don
'
t
know
how
to
speak
it
so
i
got
something
lol
[prabipyakurel]
There
are
so
many
out
there
And
next
time
I
hear
you
I
won
’
t
judge
[sskarz]
haha
i
appreciate
you
,
but
don
'
t
be
afraid
to
crack
a
chuckle
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
perfect
either
so
.
Oh
I
will
let
out
a
few
laughs
but
for
fun
only
.
❤
️
I
make
fun
of
everyone
randomly
[sskarz]
we
love
that
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
don
’
t
you
love
to
laugh
at
people
when
they
fall
or
something
instead
of
asking
them
if
they
are
okay
right
away
.
Or
am
I
just
evil
[sskarz]
i
think
we
both
are
💀
because
yes
it
do
be
funny
i
try
to
keep
it
inside
but
if
its
too
stupid
not
to
laugh
then
i
just
can
'
t
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Like
when
I
try
not
to
laugh
at
something
,
it
just
won
’
t
stay
in
Even
when
everyone
is
silent
around
me
giving
me
the
death
state
,
I
will
be
on
the
floor
laughing
💀
[sskarz]
that
is
diabolical
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Sometimes
I
got
to
take
a
break
and
walk
away
from
the
situation
because
I
keep
think
about
it
[sskarz]
i
get
that
😂
sometimes
its
good
to
laugh
*
sometimes
*
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
sometimes
[sskarz]
no
no
you
first
[prabipyakurel]
💀
I
had
this
saved
for
like
a
week
ngl
[sskarz]
we
really
do
this
so
often
haha
[prabipyakurel]
But
go
first
[sskarz]
nuh
uh
i
said
it
to
you
first
[prabipyakurel]
Dammit
I
forgot
what
I
was
gonna
say
now
Oh
yea
,
how
do
you
feel
about
uni
starting
?
I
have
been
going
on
about
me
,
completely
forgot
yours
is
also
starting
soon
.
[sskarz]
im
not
really
that
worried
to
me
,
its
just
another
semester
with
new
professors
and
new
work
to
do
idk
im
used
to
the
formula
and
i
'
ve
been
handling
it
pretty
well
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
gotcha
,
yea
for
sure
you
got
this
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
and
i
got
to
check
most
of
my
professors
on
ratemyprofessors
.
com
and
they
'
re
all
good
appreciate
you
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ooo
yea
people
tell
me
to
do
that
.
[sskarz]
100
%
50
%
of
a
class
'
difficulty
is
on
the
professor
if
its
a
good
professor
,
that
50
%
is
off
and
its
just
way
easier
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
just
scared
for
my
philosophy
class
,
I
hope
the
dude
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
philosophical
aspects
of
the
work
.
[sskarz]
always
make
sure
your
professors
are
the
ones
that
will
help
you
succeed
👍
have
your
professors
been
revealed
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
know
which
professors
I
have
Only
searched
up
one
so
far
[sskarz]
search
them
all
up
trust
me
,
you
'
re
going
to
want
to
read
their
reviews
for
the
classes
you
'
re
taking
and
make
a
judgement
based
off
how
they
teach
and
their
curriculum
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
for
sure
.
Yea
hopefully
they
are
all
somewhat
nice
and
easy
going
[sskarz]
you
just
want
a
professor
that
'
s
fair
yk
there
are
some
out
there
that
are
just
teaching
for
just
the
money
[prabipyakurel]
😂
type
come
on
[sskarz]
nooooooooooooooooooooo
we
do
this
way
too
much
💀
uh
[prabipyakurel]
Wayyy
to
much
[sskarz]
now
im
tryign
to
remember
what
i
was
going
to
type
oh
right
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
they
are
just
going
to
teach
what
'
s
minimum
the
terrible
professors
i
mean
there
are
professors
like
them
and
a
lot
more
than
you
'
d
think
a
lot
of
the
times
they
do
teaching
on
the
side
and
they
have
another
primary
job
that
they
have
to
take
more
attention
to
so
you
'
re
like
an
after
thought
i
had
a
cs
professor
that
worked
with
nasa
actively
but
taught
us
on
the
side
as
well
now
he
wasn
'
t
terrible
,
but
there
are
those
that
will
still
not
put
any
effort
into
the
teaching
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
Yea
I
get
your
point
,
imma
make
sure
to
read
up
on
them
carefully
and
make
sure
that
I
get
the
teaching
for
the
amount
of
money
imma
pay
.
💯
Lol
omg
I
found
a
picture
of
you
and
my
brother
from
like
the
1st
IT
graduation
party
thing
.
[sskarz]
oh
no
burn
it
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
i
honestly
haven
'
t
looked
at
a
picture
of
myself
with
glasses
on
in
a
while
i
forgot
i
was
also
graduating
technically
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
lol
I
was
watching
the
live
and
was
like
looking
for
my
dad
and
everyone
looked
the
same
And
you
don
’
t
have
glasses
anymore
right
,
I
completely
forgot
[sskarz]
i
mean
i
can
rock
the
sunglasses
now
👍
if
you
'
re
a
fan
of
them
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
got
a
point
Haven
’
t
really
ever
put
them
on
,
got
actual
glasses
that
I
need
to
see
😂
I
am
sure
you
can
.
[sskarz]
sometimes
when
my
vision
gets
blurry
,
i
try
adjusting
my
"
glasses
"
and
i
end
up
looking
like
an
idiot
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lol
I
get
what
you
mean
I
do
that
when
I
take
them
off
for
bad
and
go
downstairs
without
them
[sskarz]
you
ever
sleep
with
your
glasses
on
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
unless
I
fall
asleep
somewhere
downstairs
or
at
other
peoples
houses
.
But
I
take
them
off
Have
you
?
[sskarz]
i
have
when
i
literally
drop
dead
and
i
can
'
t
even
react
to
put
them
away
before
i
go
to
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
that
has
happened
like
once
,
I
just
get
scared
I
will
end
up
sleeping
on
it
and
break
it
Because
like
I
need
them
to
see
,
eyesight
is
not
the
best
without
them
[sskarz]
what
'
s
your
prescription
?
[prabipyakurel]
Negative
.
75
Maybe
even
worse
now
Yours
?
[sskarz]
oh
that
'
s
not
that
bad
20
/
20
now
hahah
[prabipyakurel]
Haha
[sskarz]
but
before
i
'
m
pretty
sure
it
was
at
like
-
2
or
-
3
i
forgot
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
Yea
this
is
the
only
prescription
I
remember
but
things
blurr
out
easily
so
I
assume
it
went
up
When
did
you
get
glasses
?
[sskarz]
ever
since
i
had
memories
😂
and
consciousness
i
swear
im
not
lying
about
that
[prabipyakurel]
Like
1st
grade
[sskarz]
i
literally
cannot
remember
a
time
in
my
life
that
i
hadn
'
t
had
glasses
on
my
face
before
that
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
That
’
s
young
Most
likely
genetics
I
refuse
to
believe
you
messed
your
eye
that
bad
when
you
were
that
young
[sskarz]
oh
no
its
been
like
that
for
since
i
was
conceived
since
the
big
bang
it
was
prophesized
on
the
walls
😂

will
have
terrible
eyesight
all
his
life
,
till
he
was
19
"
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
see
[sskarz]
that
'
s
what
i
'
d
like
to
believe
,
but
i
was
already
super
around
computers
and
screens
all
the
time
as
an
infant
so
maybe
my
eyesight
just
got
terribe
as
a
wee
lad
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
like
an
IT
genius
at
2
.
😎
[sskarz]
no
i
was
a
spongebob
genius
at
2
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Right
I
forgot
I
only
got
glasses
in
8th
grade
[sskarz]
oh
wow
that
was
quite
recent
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
kinda
needed
since
7th
,
just
never
told
my
parents
I
had
problems
Till
it
got
too
bad
[sskarz]
smh
gotta
know
the
lore
of
this
incredibly
stupid
character
😂
ah
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
not
too
far
back
,
but
I
feel
like
I
got
so
used
to
it
,
I
can
’
t
really
go
anywhere
or
have
been
anywhere
without
them
Unless
it
’
s
for
pictures
[sskarz]
you
don
'
t
like
wearing
your
glasses
in
pictures
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
do
,
but
like
when
I
wear
Nepali
clothes
,
I
like
the
change
of
a
picture
without
my
glasses
Looks
different
[sskarz]
oh
i
seeee
its
the
opposite
for
me
i
used
to
hate
taking
pictures
without
my
glasses
honestly
i
still
kinda
do
,
sunglasses
got
me
covered
tho
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
am
sure
you
look
fine
without
your
glasses
,
maybe
because
you
had
it
on
for
so
long
,
it
doesn
’
t
feel
right
without
it
[sskarz]
yeah
but
idk
just
feels
so
weird
and
wrong
19
years
of
looking
a
certain
way
till
not
is
jarring
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
understand
if
I
am
in
jeans
and
t
shirt
,
I
need
my
glasses
Lol
I
see
[sskarz]
would
you
ever
do
lasik
surgery
?
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
when
I
am
a
little
older
,
like
after
bachelors
perhaps
Don
’
t
wanna
do
anything
to
my
eye
just
yet
,
when
I
have
the
time
,
I
think
I
will
.
[sskarz]
oh
ok
nice
it
is
a
really
weird
experience
im
ngl
like
your
entire
vision
goes
white
when
they
cut
it
open
and
you
feel
like
you
just
entered
heaven
'
s
gates
and
i
swear
i
thought
i
died
[prabipyakurel]
We
’
re
you
writing
[sskarz]
writing
?
[prabipyakurel]
The
text
And
then
it
went
away
[sskarz]
oh
you
mean
if
i
was
typing
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
oh
no
i
didn
'
t
mean
to
you
can
speak
your
mind
im
sorry
i
try
to
stop
typing
and
then
i
start
go
ahead
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
no
no
Lol
I
thought
I
was
being
mean
for
a
little
We
got
to
stop
doing
that
lol
Yea
I
was
just
going
to
ask
if
you
felt
anything
during
the
surgery
,
like
did
it
hurt
?
[sskarz]
no
they
gave
me
anxiety
pills
to
take
and
then
they
numbed
my
eye
with
some
drops
so
when
they
started
going
on
my
eye
,
i
felt
nothing
not
even
pressure
so
it
really
felt
like
i
was
about
to
ascend
to
heaven
😂
until
i
saw
the
scalpel
going
across
my
vision
and
then
everything
started
going
wonky
like
idk
how
to
explain
it
its
like
they
took
my
vision
and
started
moving
like
it
was
aggressively
drunk
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
sounds
pretty
funny
tho
[sskarz]
just
in
circles
in
circles
in
circles
im
ngl
that
'
s
when
i
learned
i
was
not
afraid
of
death
i
felt
at
peace
when
going
through
that
10
minute
process
literally
like
you
can
'
t
hear
anything
,
can
'
t
see
anything
,
barely
can
feel
the
bed
you
'
re
sleeping
on
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[sskarz]
its
like
if
you
died
surreal
and
then
once
the
operation
was
done
,
its
like
if
you
literally
went
blind
[prabipyakurel]
Ooooo
[sskarz]
like
im
talking
the
last
prescription
before
declared
blindness
like
everything
is
blurry
,
even
if
they
'
re
right
next
to
your
face
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
crazy
[sskarz]
like
a
foggy
dashboard
of
your
car
how
your
windshield
is
in
fog
and
it
just
won
'
t
wipe
away
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
[sskarz]
so
you
can
'
t
see
anything
yeah
like
that
its
wild
but
once
i
slept
like
16
hours
and
i
woke
up
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
must
have
felt
a
little
scary
[sskarz]
its
like
crystal
clear
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
,
I
thought
that
those
that
did
eye
surgery
would
be
able
to
see
clearly
right
away
[sskarz]
nope
actually
quite
the
contrary
,
you
have
to
literally
close
your
eyes
all
day
you
can
'
t
see
screens
or
they
litearlly
burn
your
retina
so
you
have
to
go
straight
home
,
and
go
to
sleep
so
i
slept
at
like
2
pm
,
woke
up
multiple
times
throughout
the
night
but
i
kept
my
eyes
shut
its
painful
for
that
one
day
not
as
in
literal
pain
,
but
like
not
being
able
to
do
anything
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
,
that
’
s
wild
tho
.
You
don
’
t
feel
pain
or
anything
now
right
?
[sskarz]
nope
only
if
i
stare
at
a
screen
for
like
10
hours
straight
but
that
'
s
like
normal
for
most
people
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
the
only
thing
is
that
your
astigmatism
goes
through
the
roof
at
least
for
my
procedure
i
didn
'
t
do
actual
LASIK
,
i
did
something
called
SMILE
which
is
a
form
of
LASIK
but
it
comes
with
different
properties
such
as
heightened
astigmatism
so
bright
small
lights
have
that
huge
glow
around
them
if
you
drive
at
night
you
might
know
what
im
talking
about
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
like
this
its
more
than
what
they
show
on
the
picture
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
I
see
this
every
once
in
a
while
[sskarz]
really
?
so
maybe
you
have
light
astigmatism
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
only
happens
sometimes
but
yea
sometimes
it
looks
like
that
I
thought
seeing
that
was
normal
[sskarz]
it
is
normal
astigmatism
is
normal
most
people
have
it
lol
and
its
not
a
big
deal
in
terms
of
our
eyesight
and
how
it
impacts
how
far
you
can
see
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
[sskarz]
are
you
near
sighted
or
far
sighted
?
[prabipyakurel]
Near
sighted
[sskarz]
oh
okay
that
'
s
great
because
its
a
lot
easier
to
do
LASIK
with
near
sightedness
than
far
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
dad
is
far
sighted
,
he
can
’
t
read
off
a
paper
in
front
of
him
but
you
put
it
at
a
distance
and
he
will
read
it
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
i
used
to
be
near
sighted
far
sighted
have
the
big
issues
with
trying
to
improve
their
eyesight
im
no
optomoterist
tho
so
idk
the
specific
details
as
to
why
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
Yea
idk
eyes
are
weird
to
understand
[sskarz]
they
'
re
pretty
cool
but
complicated
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yep
Hey
I
am
going
to
head
to
bed
for
now
,
it
was
great
talking
to
you
as
always
.
Good
night
,
sleep
tight
😴,
I
will
talk
to
you
tomorrow
.
💤
❤
️
[sskarz]
Good
night
and
sleep
tight
💤
.
Who
knows
,
maybe
we
'
ll
call
tomorrow
:),
either
way
,
talk
to
you
tomorrow
❤
️
💤
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
good
afternoon
!
[sskarz]
hey
good
afternoon
!
did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
was
kinda
uncomfortable
because
of
the
weather
but
I
randomly
passed
out
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
i
passed
out
like
2
mins
after
my
last
text
haha
i
had
such
a
weird
vivid
nightmare
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
was
me
too
vivid
nightmare
?
[sskarz]
yeah
it
was
super
weird
and
confusing
i
thought
it
was
so
real
until
i
woke
up
when
i
realized
i
was
being
delusional
in
my
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
damn
what
did
you
see
?
[sskarz]
basically
i
was
talking
to
someone
i
really
did
not
like
in
my
past
and
i
was
confused
as
to
why
i
was
talking
with
them
in
the
first
place
and
then
i
got
like
death
threats
and
it
was
just
what
[prabipyakurel]
geez
,
thats
odd
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
hated
that
person
?
[sskarz]
i
did
yeah
i
still
do
,
but
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
'
ve
even
thought
about
them
so
i
was
really
confused
when
i
saw
them
in
my
dream
for
no
reason
i
swear
it
was
like
lucid
dreaming
i
can
'
t
really
explain
why
i
hated
that
person
just
because
there
'
s
a
lot
of
history
in
it
,
but
i
really
don
'
t
like
when
people
emotionally
manipulate
and
have
the
freedom
to
do
that
when
they
threaten
to
kill
themselves
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
yea
forget
about
those
people
Don
'
t
even
think
about
them
.
[sskarz]
i
haven
'
t
till
last
night
lol
they
were
part
of
my
early
high
school
days
its
been
years
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
Were
your
friends
before
or
,
just
classmates
?
[sskarz]
when
i
first
met
them
we
were
friends
but
you
know
no
one
really
shows
themselves
for
who
they
are
based
off
first
meet
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
understand
[sskarz]
you
catch
onto
things
as
time
goes
on
and
i
learned
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
sorry
that
you
had
to
see
them
again
.
Was
it
a
group
of
people
?
[sskarz]
it
was
one
person
for
the
most
part
but
the
group
they
were
part
of
were
also
problematic
for
diferent
reasons
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
okay
[sskarz]
i
was
just
shocked
for
the
most
part
i
forgot
they
existed
for
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
Keep
forgetting
,
get
them
out
of
your
brain
.
👍
Yea
fr
people
that
have
hurt
you
mentally
or
physically
are
not
worth
anything
.
[sskarz]
100
%
i
tried
to
help
them
but
when
it
started
affecting
my
other
friends
too
is
when
i
draw
the
line
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
yea
,
stay
away
from
them
[sskarz]
the
crazy
part
is
that
they
actually
attend
my
college
,
thankfully
i
haven
'
t
ran
into
them
[prabipyakurel]
I
pray
that
you
dont
[sskarz]
most
of
the
people
that
i
dislike
are
on
my
campus
and
i
'
ve
only
seen
one
a
couple
of
times
got
no
one
from
my
high
school
that
i
actually
like
with
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
,
its
alright
,
you
are
friendly
and
I
am
sure
you
are
great
at
connecting
with
new
people
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
don
'
t
worry
about
me
,
i
'
ve
found
way
cooler
people
that
i
like
to
be
around
💯
[prabipyakurel]
For
the
most
part
,
if
I
went
to
cal
state
LA
i
would
run
into
half
my
elementary
middle
and
high
school
friends
Lot
of
them
roaming
around
there
[sskarz]
ah
i
see
i
'
m
just
glad
its
not
high
school
and
i
'
m
not
forced
to
see
them
roaming
the
halls
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep
hallways
being
back
memories
[sskarz]
yeah
college
so
far
has
way
better
memories
to
remember
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
yea
sometimes
a
chance
of
location
and
enviroment
does
it
.
💯
[sskarz]
so
what
do
you
have
planned
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
much
,
bored
,
probably
gonna
through
my
closet
to
look
through
clothes
.
You

[sskarz]
Hey
hey
good
afternoon
!
Sorry
if
I
’
ve
been
off
,
crazy
thing
popping
up
left
and
right
How
was
your
day
yesterday
?
I
didn
’
t
get
to
ask
[prabipyakurel]
Good
afternoon
,
no
worries
,
no
need
to
apologize
lol
.
Um
yesterday
was
not
too
busy
,
we
just
had
a
normal
day
.
I
took
all
my
clothes
out
from
my
closet
and
made
a
mess
,
then
decided
yesterday
wasnt
the
day
to
start
organizing
,
so
i
shoved
everything
back
in
there
aggressively
.
Then
we
had
a
small
puja
at
night
,
which
was
pretty
much
it
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Ah
you
must
’
ve
felt
pretty
overloaded
[prabipyakurel]
A
little
but
I
will
just
fix
it
another
day
.
How
is
your
project
coming
along
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
going
good
,
haven
’
t
got
to
work
on
it
today
yet
We
just
had
a
large
influx
of
family
over
since
yesterday
and
I
had
literally
no
idea
this
was
happening
so
all
of
yesterday
and
most
of
today
has
just
been
hanging
with
them
My
social
meter
is
beyond
depleted
tho
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
well
that
must
have
felt
nice
.
Do
you
have
like
baby
cousins
that
you
saw
?
[sskarz]
If
I
had
known
they
were
staying
over
maybe
,
but
I
had
no
clue
Nah
I
met
a
cousin
my
age
and
his
little
sister
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
so
it
was
like
a
little
sleepover
.
Aww
yea
little
kids
are
fun
to
have
around
to
a
certain
extent
.
[sskarz]
far
from
little
😂
but
I
learned
today
that
they
are
also
leaving
later
today
so
it
was
a
big
relief
as
much
as
I
like
my
extended
family
,
I
can
only
deal
with
so
much
without
mentally
preparing
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
,
well
thats
nice
,
was
your
room
used
or
something

stories
that
were
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

having
family

is
fun
,
can
be
exhausting
,
but
exciting
too
.
👍
I
love
people
that
have
funny
stories
to
tell
.
[sskarz]
He
’
s
one
of
the
funniest
guys
ever
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
What
is
his
name
?
[sskarz]
Suvan
from
Virginia
maybe
you
know
him
?
[prabipyakurel]
Uh

,
first
time
hearing
that
name
.
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
he
comes
over
every
other
year
to
hang
out
and
we
catch
up
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh
that
is
nice
,
ngl
that
is
a
pretty
cool
name
,
haven
'
t
heard
it
before
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
his
sisters
name
is
suvani
👍
But
we
call
her
pinky
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
that
is
so
cuteeeee
I
love
giving
little
kids
nicknames
[sskarz]
hahaha
you
like
being
around
kids
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
like
from
babies
to
like
5
year
olds
,
anything
above
that
to
like
13
is
a
no
.
😂
You
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
basically
the
same
for
me
But
I
don
’
t
really
get
baby
fever
or
anything
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
yea
when
I
see
a
little
kid
,
I
got
to
go
say
hi
and
hold
them
in
my
arms
until
they
start
crying
,
then
I
put
them
down
and
leave
them
alone
lol
.
[sskarz]
Yup
that
’
s
baby
fever
at
work
lol
😂
my
entire
family
has
it
but
me
idk
why
I
like
playing
with
them
but
I
don
’
t
really
go
too
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmm
maybe
you
just
haven
'
t
met
a
cute
little
kid
yet
.
[sskarz]
Oh
no
trust
me
I
have
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
become
a
baby
with
babies
Like
you
will
no
longer
think
I
am
an
18
year
old
😂
You
dont
like
ever
go
to
a
little
kid
and
pick
them
up
or
play
peak
-
a
-
boo
with
them
?
[sskarz]
I
do
but
not
for
long
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
[sskarz]
It
might
be
because
I
was
also
an
annoying
kid
so
maybe
somewhere
something
happened
I
’
m
just
not
too
crazy
about
kids
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
are
not
annoying
,
but
you
are
funny
,
but
i
understand
where
you
are
coming
from
.
😂
[sskarz]
no
no
I
mean
as
a
kid
I
was
definitely
annoying
💀
Like
5
-
6
year
old
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lol
sorry
,
woops
,
I
mean
i
was
annoying
as
a
kid
too
,
sometimes
still
am
.
After
the
age
of
5
,
its
pretty
predictable
that
a
kid
will
be
somewhat
annoying
[sskarz]
Haha
you
are
far
from
annoying
😂
It
’
s
a
canon
event
for
every
kid
[prabipyakurel]
Right
Do
you
have
any
other
plans
for
the
day
?
[sskarz]
Haven
’
t
thought
about
it
yet
I
was
going
to
go
to
the
gym
earlier
today
but
I
wanted
to
wait
for
the
family
to
leave
so
I
can
say
bye
Still
here
so
till
then
I
’
m
not
doing
anything
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
lol
its
okay
maybe
you
can
skip
gym
for
the
day
.
[sskarz]
Impossible
I
must
go
😂
wbu
tho
,
plans
?
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
i
found
this
a
while
back
.
Read
it
carefully
,
its
life
advice
.
[sskarz]
💀
Goofy
ahh
meme
LOL
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
living
with
whatever
life
throws
at
me
.
[sskarz]
Me
fr
[prabipyakurel]
Some
people
have
an
entire
routine
,
you
know
those
aesthetic
ones
and
all
,
and
I
am
here
sitting
wondering
what
will
come
up
for
the
day
.
[sskarz]
Duuuuuuuude
yeah
Sometimes
I
do
have
that
routine
but
it
’
s
often
interrupted
by
random
events
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
always
,
like
I
will
be
like
imma
do
this
today
and
parents
be
like
get
ready
in
10
min
,
we
going
out
somewhere
.
[sskarz]
OMG
I
hate
when
they
do
that
Like
I
’
ll
ask
if
we
’
re
doing
anything
at
all
today
,
they
’
ll
say
no
,
then
sometime
later
that
day
we
have
a
plan
to
do
something
all
of
a
sudden
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
when
I
am
bored
af
i
don
'
t
mind
,
but
when
I
needed
to
get
something
done
,
ooooo
its
bad
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
here
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
they
make
plans
on
the
spot
,
within
5
min
[sskarz]
Ikr
and
it
’
s
like
that
one
day
where
you
need
to
do
something
specific
[prabipyakurel]
Its
so
relatable
and
sometimes
its
a
plan
that
you
never
expected
.
Like
you
don
'
t
even
know
why
you
are
going
there
and
to
do
what
exactly
.
[sskarz]
Me
every
time
I
’
m
going
to
a
Nepali
event
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
I
swear
they
’
ll
be
like
,
oh
it
’
s
a
barthamun
,
but
I
’
d
have
to
figure
it
out
who
was
the
one
that
had
to
go
bald
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
,
one
of
those
where
you
have
to
figure
out
the
main
character
of
the
event
situation
I
be
just
following
for
the
food
[sskarz]
frrrrr
And
it
’
s
always
at
the
same
venues
every
time
[prabipyakurel]
Nepali
people
when
they
find
one
good
venue
,
everyone
is
gonna
use
it
for
something
.
[sskarz]
So
I
ask
my
parents
which
venue
it
is
and
if
it
’
s
a
one
with
terrible
food
,
I
try
my
best
to
convince
them
that
I
don
’
t
want
to
go
😂
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yessssss
[sskarz]
If
it
’
s
not
good
food
and
the
event
is
something
I
don
’
t
care
about
then
it
’
s
just
recipe
for
disaster
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
gonna
be
bored
for
hours
When
you
have
to
go
to
a
nepali
even
do
you
ever
think
about
the
possibility
of
you
meeting
someone
you
can
talk
to
and
if
you
can
'
t
think
of
any
,
you
dont
go
.
idk
if
that
is
only
me
[sskarz]
Omg
yes
that
’
s
the
third
requirement
I
gotta
know
someone
there
that
I
can
talk
to
Like
if
you
’
re
at
an
event
,
I
’
ll
go
cuz
at
least
we
can
talk
If
there
’
s
no
one
I
know
I
DEFINITELY
don
’
t
wanna
go
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhh
lol
the
3rd
requirement
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
wanna
be
that
guy
in
the
corner
sleeping
or
on
the
phone
all
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
love
it
when
I
can
talk
to
someone
and
not
just
sitting
there
looking
at
groups
of
uncles
and
aunties
having
conversations
Just
sitting
in
the
corner
and
staring
at
other
people
.
[sskarz]
Frrr
thankfully
after
the
pandemic
there
’
s
not
that
many
functions
[prabipyakurel]
ik
kinda
glad
[sskarz]
I
remember
it
used
to
be
like
every
weekend
and
I
was
so
tired
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
like
it
was
a
party
for
some
of
the
most
simple
things
maybe
also
because
when
we
were
younger
,
there
werent
as
much
nepali
people
and
now
you
will
meet
a
new
one
at
every
function
lol
[sskarz]
Yeahhhhhhh
I
feel
like
recently
there
’
s
been
a
large
influx
of
Nepali
people
living
in
California
Like
new
people
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
a
lot
of
new
people
[sskarz]
I
used
to
be
able
to
recognize
everyone
at
a
party
Now
everyone
I
recognize
at
a
function
is
at
like
2
tables
😂
In
a
room
of
20
tables
[prabipyakurel]
right
,
I
used
to
be
like
oh
this
persons
reletive
or
its
this
person
,
and
now
I
have
to
ask
and
be
like
who
dis
?
😂
[sskarz]
It
’
s
crazy
out
here
💯
[prabipyakurel]
So
you
still
watching
icarly
?
[sskarz]
Yep
But
we
’
re
not
really
watching
We
’
re
like
stalking
some
people
on
instagram
on
some
tea
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
That
sounds
fun
[sskarz]
nah
I
have
no
idea
what
’
s
going
on
💀
I
just
looked
for
a
second
and
they
’
re
stalking
some
Nepali
twins
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
insta
is
fun
for
stalking
people
,
not
that
I
do
that
,
it
is
still
new
to
me
so
I
discover
something
new
every
once
in
a
while
.
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhh
I
forget
you
’
re
new
to
the
social
media
space
I
don
’
t
do
insta
stalking
but
my
sister
loves
to
so
I
just
listen
to
her
stories
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
i
honestly
wouldnt
have
gotten
it
if
my
friends
didnt
keep
telling
me
I
would
mane
any
friends
or
connections
with
out
insta
[sskarz]
It
’
s
definitely
harder
to
connect
without
these
apps
but
it
’
s
not
all
that
necessary
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
sometimes
its
fun
to
type
the
name
of
celebs
and
people
from
you
school
you
knew
nothing
about
and
see
what
they
are
like
.
[sskarz]
True
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
I
would
sometimes
just
type
the
weirdest
names
to
see
if
someone
with
that
name
exists
lol
[sskarz]
Same
lol
I
search
up
some
people
who
I
haven
’
t
seen
or
heard
from
in
years
and
it
’
s
always
a
shock
to
see
how
they
are
now
[prabipyakurel]
lol
me
too
Well
hey
,
imma
let
you
spend
time
with
family
and
I
will
catch
up
with
you
later
.
Also
,
you
can
skip

for
a
day
,

[prabipyakurel]
Oh

?
At

[sskarz]
Yeah
I
came
from
dropping
off
my
cousins
family
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
,
lol
you
weren
'
t
kidding
about
how
its
impossible
to
miss
the
gym
[sskarz]
The
grind
never
stops
👍
I
’
m
feeling
incredible
right
now
Sad
songs
in
the
gym
go
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
You
got
strength
to
be
lifting
rn
,
thats
crazy
[sskarz]
I
did
take
250
ml
of
caffeine
A
Celsius
[prabipyakurel]
Why
are
you
listening
to
sad
songs
?
[sskarz]
But
that
was
about
2
hours
ago
[prabipyakurel]
Caffeine
is
good
.
[sskarz]
So
as
I
bench
,
the
tears
run
down
my
face
and
I
get
motivated
😂
😂
Nah
I
’
m
just
joking
,
tho
my
gym
partner
does
that
and
looks
at
his
past
texts
with
his
ex
as
a
motivator
😭
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
why
would
you
do
that
.
Yea
don
'
t
do
the
same
.
The
way
you
put
it
💀
[sskarz]
The
strongest
of
wills
require
the
greater
sacrifices
😂
-
Thanos
I
’
ve
seen
my
friend
do
it
and
it
was
so
funny
😂
😂
I
couldn
’
t
hold
my
laughter
So
how
was
your
day
like
?
[prabipyakurel]
Pretty
smooth
,
nothing
too
interesting
.
But
I
found
out
that
I
have
not
been
assigned
roommates
with
my
friends
and
they
are
2
brand
new
people
that
I
dont
know
.
😭
[sskarz]
RIP
well
seems
like
you
have
some
new
upcoming
friends
[prabipyakurel]
imma
have
to
SOCIALIZE
,
I
dont
got
energy
for
that
,
or
skills
.
[sskarz]
No
I
’
ve
seen
you
You
’
re
that
social
butterfly
❤
️
U
got
this
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
for
the
motivation
,
when
I
saw
the
email
today
,
I
was
like
actually
pretty
bummed
out
because
I
thought
that
the
worst
was
moving
away
from
family
,
and
the
feeling
of
being
with
new
people
alone
is
another
thing
to
add
to
the
list
.
[sskarz]
Orrr
playing
as
your
angels
advocate
,
you
can
hang
out
with
some
people
that
and
enjoy
their
company
to
have
the
best
time
you
can
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
ig
I
can
give
that
a
try
Maybe
it
won
'
t
be
as
bad
as
I
am
making
it
and
I
won
'
t
end
up
lonely
.
[sskarz]
I
doubt
it
I
don
’
t
see
how
someone
can
dislike
you
❤
️
You
’
ll
do
great
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
🙂
makes
me
feel
better
.
❤
️
How
long
do
you
usually
stay
at
the
gym
?
[sskarz]
Uh
it
depends
If
I
’
m
not
feeling
it
as
much
then
I
go
for
at
least
30
minutes
but
I
go
as
hard
as
I
can
But
I
’
m
pumped
then
I
stay
for
around
an
hour
and
a
half
to
2
hours
I
still
go
as
hard
as
I
can
If
you
ever
wanna
see
progress
,
gotta
give
it
your
all
in
anything
you
want
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
.
[sskarz]
So
tonight
I
did
an
hour
session
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
actually
pretty
good
advice
,
I
will
use
that
if
and
when
I
start
going
to
the
gym
.
[sskarz]
Come
with
me
to
the
gym
,
I
’
ll
teach
you
everything
you
need
to
know
😂
Berkeley

a
killer
gym
🤷

ask
why

’
t
want
to
hangout
?
Just

honest
question
[prabipyakurel]
Um
at
the
moment
because
I

’
t
really
go
out
too
much
and
feel
kinda
awkward
.
[sskarz]
Oh

[sskarz]
Hey

late
reply
,
went
to
the
gym
late
at
night
again
my
day
was
pretty
busy
,
so
just
usual
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
worries
,
were
you
listening
to
sad
songs
as
your
motivation
again
?
[sskarz]
nah
not
this
time
,
i
had
some
hype
music
going
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
anything
interesting
?
[sskarz]
uhhhhh
someone
told
me
i
was
their
role
model
,
so
i
guess
that
was
cool
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
got
in
tough
with
my
new
roomates
and
they
are
pretty
nice
.
[sskarz]
nice
!
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
thats
so
sweet
I
am
sure
you
are
a
great
role
model
.
[sskarz]
never
thought
of
myself
that
way
so
that
surprised
me
i
took
it
humbly
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
should
,
that
is
great
.
[sskarz]
so
looks
like
you
'
re
going
to
be
making
some
new
friends
are
you
excited
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
pretty
excited
,
although
I
don
'
t
know
how
I
feel
about
one
of
them
,
but
I
will
just
be
myself
and
I
think
it
will
be
fine
.
[sskarz]
why
do
you
think
that
of
a
specific
person
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
she
messages
us
in
a
group
first
and
was
really
nice
,
but
when
I
checked
her
insta
,
the
pictures
were
a
little
different
than
I
expected
.
[sskarz]
oh
?
interesting
well
don
'
t
judge
a
book
by
it
'
s
cover
,
but
do
stay
aware
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
I
have
to
meet
her
and
see
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
From
the
way
she
talks
she
is
extremely
nice
.

Like

[sskarz]
Yeah
I
’
ve

sleep
schedule
I
just
couldn
’
t
go
to
sleep
yesterday
no

yourself
,
sleep
is
important
.
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
You

t

tea

[sskarz]
No

t
have
caffeine
I
would
’
ve

day
yesterday

[prabipyakurel]
Good

[sskarz]

2
days
I
finally
got
some
breathing
time
today
after
class
and
I
took
a
nap
👍
literally

the
best
nap
ever
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
naps

good
,
are
you
putting
together
another
computer
or
is
it
another
project

[sskarz]

my
class
and
my
dad
'
s
class
and
my
club
and
my
game
development
team
and
my
other
project
all
culminating
at
its
climax
i
haven
'
t
gotten
good
sleep
in
the
last
5
days
[prabipyakurel]
Dang

that
is
a
LOT
Wow
,
you

had
a
week

[sskarz]

drop
some
responsibilities
that
aren
'
t
necessary
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

drink
water
.
[sskarz]
I

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

you
don
'
t
need

stress
over
it
,

'
t
do
it
.
❤
️
Lol

is
what
my
dad
tells
me
to
do
everyday
.
They

me
those
half
gallon
bottles

a
life
saver

[prabipyakurel]
Thats
what
I

But
if

[sskarz]

'
re
all
just
chilling
,
i
opened
up
some
manga
gonna
just
enjoy
my
time
finally
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
had
to
think
about
what
a
manga
was
for
a
second
Had
a
brain
fart
[sskarz]
💀
fair
enough
[prabipyakurel]
hell
yea
you
probably
deserve
it
.
[sskarz]
not
probably
,
definitely
💯
im
taking
this
in
pride
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
the
list
of
things
that
you
had
including
a
class
to
teach
,
yea
you
should
grab
all
the
snacks
you
can
find
and
lay
down
for
the
remainder
of
the
time
before
dinner
.
[sskarz]
mhmmmmmmm
the
way
im
about
to
snuggle
up
its
literally
been
hell
[prabipyakurel]
Can
'
t
even
imagine
.
[sskarz]
how
'
s
been
talking
with
your
future
roommates
?
also
how
many
roommates
do
you
have
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
have
actually
gotten
to
know
them
better
.
Well
of
them
,
the
ohter
one
has
said
"
hi
"
so
far
.
2
other
roommates
[sskarz]
oh
nice
!
well
that
one
other
person
is
probably
shy
damn
that
'
s
a
lot
of
people
for
a
singular
dorm
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
seems
like
it
,
I
was
hesitating
on
replying
.
Its
scary
texting
someone
you
haven
'
t
seen
before
.
Right
,
its
gonna
take
a
while
adjusting
.
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
true
but
i
'
m
sure
you
will
be
friends
with
them
❤
️
usually
aren
'
t
there
like
2
people
per
dorm
?
is
your
dorm
big
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
this
one
is
a
triple
No
normal
room
[sskarz]
oh
i
seee
damn
i
mean
you
'
ll
manage
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
I
got
it
,
at
least
in
my
head
i
do
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
gonna
manifest
comfort
and
security
you
got
this
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Appreciate
it
,
thanks
!
Also
,
did
you
know
it
is
spider
season
now
?
[sskarz]
oh
so
its
your
favorite
season
?
💀
😂
i
mean
that
lowkey
makes
sense
,
i
killed
one
the
other
day
[prabipyakurel]
OH
I
have
been
seeing
like
baby
ones
everywhere
,
its
messing
with
me
.
[sskarz]
that
flamethrower
gonna
come
in
clutch
💀
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Imma
be
carrying
that
with
me
like
its
an
ID
or
something
[sskarz]
"
do
you
carry
a
pepper
spray
?"
"
nah
i
got
this
tho
"
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
probably
be
a
bad
idea
giving
me
any
thing
of
that
sort
tbh
OMG
like
a
few
months
also
there
was
a
spider
near
my
room
and
I
told
my
dad
to
remove
it
and
throw
it
OUTSIDE
and
he
took
it
and
just
dropped
it
down
the
stairs
and
said
,
"
there
its
gone
",
that
thing
is
probably
big
now
and
laying
eggs
.
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
how
cool
would
it
be
to
own
a
flamethrower
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
,
I
wouldn
'
t
mind
having
one
.
👍
I
was
late
for
school
and
walking
at
the
pace
of
a
turtle
down
the
stairs
.
Just
yeets
it
down
there
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
like
that
,
or
other
days
he
is
gonna
be
like
"
oh
wow
,
its
gonna
eat
you
"
[sskarz]
your
dad
is
a
menace
oh
my
god
💀
😂
i
mean
maybe
that
spider
died
on
impact
it
was
a
pretty
far
fall
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
but
we
have
like
flowers
on
this
stand
and
it
probably
fell
on
that
.
Trust
me
those
dont
die
fast
,
they
take
a
long
time
to
die
Like
why
the
hell
do
they
not
die
faster
[sskarz]
frr
maybe
u
should
start
research
on
the
death
of
all
spiders
altho
i
think
if
all
spiders
died
,
our
entire
ecosystem
would
be
in
shambles
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
I
will
run
across
and
picture
of
one
and
traumatize
myself
.
You
put
up
and
picture
and
you
will
go
home
injured
from
my
house
.
[sskarz]
SHEEEEEEEEESH
😂
aye
aye
ma
'
am
im
already
sore
as
it
is
i
can
'
t
take
a
beating

[sskarz]
Just

took
a
shower
👍
Workout

was
like
no
one
there
and
it
was
really
quiet
I
love
going
to
the
gym
on
Sunday
just
for
that
reason
lol
Never
ever
seen
that
word
in
any
article
of
writing
literature
anywhere
I
swear
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
in
peace
.
You
could
have
performed
and
sung
your
song
you
were
listening
to
at
the
top
of
your
lungs
.
That
exactly
how
I
felt
too
😂
Sanskar
I
need
help

battleships
💀
*
that
would
probably
take
ages
tho
*
or
what
about
like
hide
and
go
seek
but
that
may
be
too
disruptive
[prabipyakurel]
Nooooo

your
brother

with
them

[prabipyakurel]
Hopefully

my
bed
.
👍
There
were
like
groups
of
kids
and
adults
separated
and
I
was
just

😂
[sskarz]

re

[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
like
a
great
day
.
Well
it
wasn
’
t
all
that
bad
either
,
the
food
was
real
good
,
and
this
one
kid
names
Alan
he
was
adorable
,
younger
than
the
rest
and
kept
coming
up
to
me
for
more
yogurt
and
lalmon
.
Then
we
got
little
gifts
and
there
was
a
mini
crystal
and
I
accidentally
dropped
it
.
Yea
life
.
[sskarz]
sounds
like
a
not
bad
day
❤
️
cleaning
after
all
that
must
'
ve
been
rough
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
one
dumb
kid
,
don
’
t
know
who
,
spilled
coke
on
the
little
bed
we
have
next
to
the
sofa
in
the
living
room
and
I
was
like
done
.
And
the
rest
was
pretty
much
my
parents
,
I
was
just
there
eating
dessert
.
[sskarz]
oh
nice
kids
really
be
like
that
they
are
guaranteed
to
make
a
mess
at
a
party
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
ready
to
clean
up
a
mess
After
a
while
they
stopped
listening
to
me
and
I
was
like
okay
you
do
you
[sskarz]
kids
be
kids
Hey

m

Goodnight

❤

😴
Hey
!
Sorry
for
the
long
wait
,
it
just
went
from
a
chill
day
to
everything
everywhere
all
at
once
How
’
s
your
day
been
?
[prabipyakurel]
Everything
alright
?
Pretty
smooth
,
talked
to
my
best
friend
for
a
while
and
ate
cup
noodles
.
Are
you
busy
rn
?
[sskarz]
sounds
like
a
nice
and
cozy
day
👍
thankfully
no
just
tired
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okie
Ahh
I
see
,
maybe
you
should
just
lay
down
and
think
about
nothing
[sskarz]
i
'
m
too
tired
to
think
about
nothing
at
this
point
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
that
’
s
a
problem
[sskarz]
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
a
really
long
time
,
i
feel
like
im
powerless
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
alright
,
sometimes
when
too
many
things
are
thrown
at
you
at
once
,
life
gets
kinda
boring
and
exhausting
,
but
after
a
good
night
sleep
you
should
be
good
to
go
tomorrow
.
[sskarz]
that
'
s
what
i
thought
too
,
but
I
'
ve
started
to
feel
like
this
for
a
little
bit
now
idk
just
thinking
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
worried
about
anything
specific
or
thinking
too
much
about
something
?
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
explain
everything
,
but
I
feel
like
I
'
m
being
pulled
to
do
so
many
things
that
I
can
'
t
focus
at
all
like
spreading
thin
these
past
couple
of
days
really
made
me
feel
like
no
matter
how
much
I
try
to
focus
to
do
the
things
I
want
to
do
,
something
interrupts
and
its
like
I
can
'
t
get
a
grip
sorry
for
venting
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
no
no
,
I
am
always
here
if
you
want
to
talk
,
it
’
s
okay
.
❤
️
Maybe
rewarding
yourself
often
with
like
little
treats
or
taking
breaks
often
is
what
you
need
.
writing
how
you
feel
on
a
paper
or
sharing
is
always
a
good
way
to
release
all
that
you
are
feeling
.
But
I
can
tell
you
will
be
just
fine
,
take
time
for
yourself
,
don
’
t
take
in
too
much
and
try
to
space
things
out
as
much
as
possible
.
Idk
if
this
helped
,
but
yea
like
I
said
you
can
always
just
share
how
you
are
feeling
when
you
are
feeling
stressed
and
overwhelmed
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
No
it
did
help
,
thank
you
❤
️
I
will
try
to
take
more
breaks
whenever
I
can
its
just
I
feel
like
I
put
so
many
things
on
my
own
plate
to
make
myself
busy
for
the
summer
,
that
I
just
put
too
much
And
now
I
'
m
heavily
regretting
it
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
completely
understand
,
I
did
so
many
unnecessary
studying
and
preparing
which
I
really
didn
’
t
need
and
now
that
it
’
s
over
I
think
to
myself
what
have
I
done
for
myself
.
[sskarz]
I
'
m
really
contemplating
on
quitting
on
one
of
them
,
but
its
difficult
when
friends
are
involved
that
I
don
'
t
want
to
let
down
.
But
at
the
same
time
I
don
'
t
know
how
much
longer
I
can
keep
doing
it
.
yeah
,
sometimes
its
just
so
much
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Well
sometimes
its
okay
to
let
your
friends
know
that
you
can
only
devote
a
certian
amount
of
time
into
something
.
I
am
sure
they
will
understand
where
you
are
coming
from
,
you
have
a
lot
of
leadership
positions
and
teach
also
,
that
is
a
lot
.
Its
okay
,
let
your
friends
know
and
it
wont
be
like
you
are
letting
them
down
.
Just
do
as
much
as
you
are
able
to
.
[sskarz]
that
'
s
probably
the
best
thing
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
deserve
rest
and
you
need
it
to
,
no
shame
in
asking
for
some
space
and
time
every
once
in
a
while
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
All
I
know
is
I
'
m
not
making
this
mistake
again
At
the
cost
of
being
able
to
be
productive
every
minute
of
every
day
,
my
mental
health
just
tanked
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
everything
in
life
teaches
us
something
,
so
maybe
drop
some
things
that
are
just
there
to
make
your
brain
hurt
.
[sskarz]
Don
'
t
do
what
I
do
lol
,
time
for
yourself
also
matters
and
I
just
completely
lost
track
of
that
too
many
things
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
still
trying
to
improve
on
giving
myself
time
,
at
this
point
whenever
good
things
happen
multiple
times
in
a
row
,
I
can
'
t
be
happy
with
a
straight
face
because
I
feel
like
something
is
going
to
come
crashing
down
.
Many
people
have
told
me
to
make
time
for
myself
because
I
don
'
t
do
that
.
I
really
got
to
stop
talking
in
too
much
than
I
can
handle
,
so
you
are
not
alone
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
couldn
'
t
relate
more
,
I
have
that
feeling
every
single
day
❤
️
we
really
got
to
stop
doing
that
haha
we
deserve
time
for
ourselves
and
do
the
things
that
we
want
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
,
Imma
go
insane
one
day
.
Imma
bungee
jump
from
somewhere
without
a
rope
,
like
a
one
time
thing
😂
😂
Yea
especially
looking
back
at
my
high
school
years
,
dude
I
gave
up
so
much
time
to
have
fun
and
try
stuff
so
I
could
get
into
the
school
of
my
dreams
,
and
it
has
caused
me
so
many
problems
.
[sskarz]
😂
hahaha
yeah
,
same
here
I
'
ve
been
working
on
becoming
successful
with
the
knowledge
I
have
for
so
many
years
now
that
I
'
ve
lost
a
lot
of
things
dear
to
me
in
the
process
as
we
both
go
into
college
,
lets
both
try
our
best
to
enjoy
life
for
what
it
is
,
and
worry
less
about
what
'
s
in
the
future
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
❤
️
🍀
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
also
just
typed
my
goodbye
message
,
I
'
m
scared
to
press
enter
I
feel
so
guilty
for
doing
this
but
its
like
how
much
more
can
I
do
this
without
actually
going
insane
and
draining
other
things
in
my
life
[prabipyakurel]
goodbye
message
?
[sskarz]
yeah
,
I
'
m

my
friend

👍
i
'
m

with
my
friends

my
mind
off
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh

you
are
feeling
better
[sskarz]
how
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um

was
one
of
those
days
,
for
the
most
part
I
packed
my
suitcase
,
created
a
big
mess
in
my
room
and
realized
I
need
another
suitcase
to
pack
my
jackets
.
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

morning
will
be
depressing
😭
Nope

at
all
,
even
though
I
will
have
them
there
for
the
day
,
when
they
will
leave
me
there
,
it
will
feel
like
shit
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
.
I
am
still
not
ready
[sskarz]
it
definitely
will
be
one
of
those
days
so
how
much
have
you
got
packed
so
far
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
an
ikea
bag
with
school
supplies
and
dorm
necessities
,
another
small
bag
with
bed
sheets
and
towels
,
another
ikea
bags
with
blankets
,
hats
,
and
one
big
suitcase
full
of
clothes
.
Then
I
got
a
bag
with
mattress
covers
and
mattress
protectors
.
Still
need
to
pack
like
shampoos
,
shoes
,
and
other
stuff
that
i
have
to
check
.
[sskarz]
oh
so
you
'
re
like
close
to
finishing
[prabipyakurel]
Pretty
much
yea
What
are
you
doing
rn
?
[sskarz]
im
just
in
a
call
with
some
of
my
buddies
we
were
playing
a
party
game
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
really
,
just
thinking
about
a
few
things
.
[sskarz]
what
'
re
you
thinking
about
?
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
just
everything
that
will
happen
.
I
keep
playing
scenarios
in
my
head
and
am
expecting
the
worst
that
can
happen
.
[sskarz]
it
'
s
grabbing
your
mind
that
hard
huh
trust
me
,
you
will
be
fine
❤
️
it
'
s
not
that
too
much
of
a
transition
,
think
of
it
as
high
school
but
classes
are
in
separate
places
and
u
just
have
a
new
environment
,
but
that
just
means
another
time
to
adapt
like
every
other
time
you
'
ve
had
to
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
that
’
s
something
to
think
about
,
thanks
!
Yea
maybe
I
am
a
little
dramatic
but
it
feels
like
my
entire
life
is
going
to
be
something
else
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
life
is
going
to
turn
into
a
new
chapter
but
it
'
ll
be
new
experiences
to
remember
for
good
times
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

I
need

see
this
situation

☀
️
I
did
,
that
puzzle
game
puzzled
me
to
sleep
Just
came
out
of
the
gym
👍
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
yea
next
time
you
have
trouble
falling
asleep
,
just
play
a
few
rounds
lol
[sskarz]
I
can
’
t
even
think
straight
through
a
single
round
😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
was
talking
to
you
yesterday
and
after
I
played
that
game
for
a
while
I
was
like
going
to
drop
,
i
slept
pretty
well
.
[sskarz]
Beauty
sleep
came
in
clutch
my
mind
is
not
built
for
puzzles
that
require
me
to
think
for
longer
than
30
seconds
💀
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Neither
is
mine
i
dont
even
know
why
I
put
myself
through
them
probably
because
of
the
boredom
[sskarz]
It
fr
be
like
that
so
what
’
s
the
plan
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Ooo
i
am
getting
my
new
glasses
today
[sskarz]
:
O
Did
you
already
pick
out
a
frame
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
Niceeeee
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
like
light
brown
ish
[sskarz]
Ooooh
they
’
ll
suit
you
well
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
hopefully
,
when
i
was
trying
them
out
,
it
looked
fine
,
so
we
shall
see
[sskarz]
Did
you
get
a
new
prescription
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
new
ones
are
more
clear
which
means
that
my
prescription
probably
got
worse
[sskarz]
Ah
yeah
it
’
s
always
like
that
Aladdin
scene
with
new
glasses
Like
everything
becomes
ultra
HD
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
like
I
take
off
my
glasses
and
like
everything
is
so
weird
Yea
sometimes
I
be
looking
real
ugly
without
glasses
[sskarz]
Nah
you
would
look
fine
❤
️
I
hated
how
I
looked
without
glasses
till
I
actually
got
eye
surgery
,
and
I
don
’
t
hate
it
as
much
anymore
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
you
look
fine
without
glasses
,
not
too
much
of
a
difference
.
❤
️
I
think
its
because
you
get
used
to
being
around
everyone
with
them
on
that
when
they
are
not
on
it
feels
weird
and
uncomfortable
idk
if
thats
only
me
[sskarz]
Yeah
100
%
It
’
s
super
weird
It
’
s
definitely
something
to
get
used
to
I
still
think
that
I
have
glasses
on
from
time
to
time
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
do
that
glasses
fix
thing
with
the
fingers
?
[sskarz]
YEAHH
LOL
like
sometimes
when
I
’
m
driving
at
night
and
since
my
astigmatism
is
super
high
,
I
try
to
like
“
adjust
”
my
glasses
that
aren
’
t
there
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
imagine
someone
sitting
next
to
you
,
they
gonna
be
like
"
what
was
dat
?"
[sskarz]
A
lot
of
people
have
noticed
me
doing
this
💀
And
it
just
feels
natural
to
do
it
even
tho
I
just
don
’
t
wear
glasses
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
mean
,
you
have
had
them
for
a
while
before
the
surgery
too
.
I
would
make
fun
of
you
all
the
time
if
i
ever
caught
it
😂
I
would
purposely
fix
my
glasses
in
front
of
you
and
laugh
[sskarz]
How
dare
you
😂
19
years
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Can
’
t
remember
a
moment
in
my
life
where
I
didn
’
t
wear
glasses
[prabipyakurel]
Daaaaamn
thats
actually
wild
wow
I
have
only
had
it
for
like
5
years
but
okay
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
’
m
pretty
sure
it
’
s
like
genetic
blindness
All
my
family
members
have
vision
impairment
[prabipyakurel]
mom
too
?
[sskarz]
But
not
from
birth
like
me
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh

[sskarz]
Yeah

of
my
parents
are
far
sighted
,
but
my
sister
and
I

But

eye
surgery
👍
Hey

[prabipyakurel]

mom

siblings

[sskarz]
Hope

❤
️
I

[prabipyakurel]
Yep

my
glasses

.
❤
️
A
little
big
on
me
but
I
think
it
works
[sskarz]
Nice
!
Can
I
see
how
they
look
?
[prabipyakurel]
My
dad
said
they
were
so
big
He
was
lecturing
me
for
choosing
these
the
entire
way
back
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Oooooh
that
frame
is
really
pretty
tho
As
brown
dads
do
hahaha
😂
I
like
your
choice
,
looks
good
on
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
yea
it
looks
nice
[sskarz]
So
does
the
world
just
seem
way
clearer
now
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
yes
I
am
sure
my
eyesight
got
even
worse
,
I
am
getting
used
to
them
They
are
so
much
more
clear
[sskarz]
Oh
did
they
give
you
a
cleaning
kit
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
Not
a
kit
,
they
give
a
box
and
that
tissue
thing
I
just
run
it
over
the
sink
,
that
is
my
cleaning
kit
😂
[sskarz]
OMG
I
used
to
do
that
all
the
time
haha
👍
[prabipyakurel]
No
one
’
s
got
time
for
kits
[sskarz]
Fr
I
lost
my
box
and
microfiber
cloth
like
2
weeks
in
without
fail
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
the
box
just
sits
there
,
there
is
no
use
when
you
need
the
glasses
24
/
7
And
totally
agree
,
the
cloth
is
stuck
in
some
corner
😂
[sskarz]
Yeah
exactly
,
and
the
only
real
time
you
put
them
down
is
to
sleep
or
shower
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
the
only
times
[sskarz]
Okay
question
,
have
you
tried
using
contacts
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
they
seemed
too
annoying
and
too
much
work
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
agree
with
that
[prabipyakurel]
My
brother
had
and
he
got
tired
of
them
and
he
got
rid
of
them
Have
you
?
[sskarz]
Ohh
so
that
’
s
why
he
’
s
just
on
glasses
now
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
We
were
like
late
for
school
and
dude
was
talking
like
a
full
30
min
putting
one
in
😂
[sskarz]
I
tried
once
and
I
almost
had
a
heart
attack
because
I
failed
to
put
it
on
and
I
thought
it
went
under
my
eye
And
that
’
s
when
I
was
like
nope
[prabipyakurel]
Ahahahaha
I
feel
like
that
would
be
a
fear
to
have
though
Imaging
getting
those
things
stuck
in
your
eye
I
would
be
dying
[sskarz]
Oh
100
%
I
saw
this
crazy
story
of
a
grandma
that
wore
contacts
her
whole
life
,
and
she
had
like
12
contacts
under
her
eye
that
stayed
there
for
years
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
she
was
storing
it
to
take
with
her
😇
[sskarz]
Oh
hell
naw
💀
😂
Like
how
do
you
not
notice
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
now
that
I
read
that
statement
it
seemed
kinda
mean
🙊
😂
[sskarz]
You
thought
she
was
about
to
die
with
them
in
LMAOO
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
when
words
just
come
out
your
mouth
and
you
it
hits
you
a
few
moments
later
😂
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
Me
when
I
try
to
give
advice
to
my
friend
And
it
just
comes
out
wrong
Every
time
without
fail
I
swear
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
I
go
give
a
dumb
advice
,
ignore
me
,
I
am
begging
😂
[sskarz]
Fr
me
I
’
ve
done
it
so
many
times
that
my
friends
have
just
made
it
a
meme
It
’
s
like
my
brain
doesn
’
t
even
get
to
process
what
I
say
in
the
moment
till
after
and
then
it
’
s
instant
regret
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
god
that
is
so
relatable
Damn
I
have
been
mean
so
many
times
now
that
I
think
about
it
[sskarz]
as
long
as
it
wasn
’
t
intentionally
it
’
s
funny
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
it
was
never
intentionally
So
when
my
friend
’
s
boyfriend
cheated
on
her
,
I
told
her
to
run
him
over
so
…
[sskarz]
Honestly
valid
[prabipyakurel]
She
took
a
better
approach
He
was
so
mean
,
you
don
’
t
do
that
That
was
cruel
[sskarz]
*
this
is
not
legal
advice
*
😂
100
%
What
did
she
do
,
now
I
’
m
curious
[prabipyakurel]
Well
they
had
a
few
problems
,
and
I
knew
the
dude
,
he
was
an
okay
person
.
They
were
going
on
and
off
and
they
had
took
a
break
for
a
while
but
like
got
together
again
a
few
weeks
for
prom
because
they
got
tickets
together
.
She
was
happy
and
they
were
matching
and
I
was
giving
all
of
my
wishes
to
them
.
But
like
after
prom
,
she
went
onto
his
insta
and
he
had
pictures
with
this
other
girl
and
they
were
hugging
and
kissing
and
stuff
.
She
FOUND
OUT
,
and
he
was
with
the
other
girl
and
still
decided
to
go
to
prom
with
her
.
It
broke
her
for
a
while
,
but
now
she
is
going
better
and
we
call
convinced
her
he
was
an
ass
[sskarz]
yeah
wtf
[prabipyakurel]
He
always
seemed
sus
[sskarz]
that
is
next
levels
of
fucked
up
💯
excuse
my
language
but
damn
that
dude
deserves
nothing
good
in
life
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
are
fine
,
yea
I
hope
he
goes
through
the
same
thing
And
she
messaged
me
at
2
:
00
but
I
only
saw
it
in
the
morning
and
she
was
not
okay
[sskarz]
damn
,
I
hope
she
'
s
doing
better
now
she
deserves
someone
way
better
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
she
is
,
that
’
s
what
we
all
told
her
[sskarz]
was
it
this
year
?
like
how
long
ago
[prabipyakurel]
It
happens
after
senior
prom
The
yearbook
came
out
after
that
happened
and

why
some
boys
are
like
,
idk
if
they
seem
sus
in
the
beginning
they
gonna
end
up
doing
something
bad
[sskarz]
100
%
valid
gotta
protect
yourself
when
you
see
stuff
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
for
sure
Anyway
,
whatcha
doing
?
[sskarz]
procrastinating
mostly
I
just
got
home
after
doing
some
work
with
my
dad
and
I
have
other
stuff
to
do
,
but
I
'
m
just
tired
so
just
chillin
on
my
PC
doom
scrolling
👍
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
sounds
like
me
and
my
everyday
life
Yea
make
sure
to
only
do
stuff
that
you
need
to
[sskarz]
it
really
be
like
that
tho
😭
me
with
any
work
I
don
'
t
wanna
do
💯
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
say
the
puzzle
but
that
is
not
for
relaxation
purposes
[sskarz]
omg
i
'
m
on
this
one
level
where
its
about
some
producer
that
goes
to
places
on
certain
days
i
slept
on
that
puzzle
but
now
i
look
at
it
and
my
head
hurts
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
’
s
alright
,
when
your
brain
itches
you
can
get
back
to
it
Oooo
I
have
been
there
,
the
higher
the
levels
and
more
boxes
to
fill
[sskarz]
i
have
a
smooth
brain
there
are
no
wrinkles
to
itch
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
the
way
you
said
that
❤
️
Have
you
tried
sodoku
I
forgot
if
I
asked
[sskarz]
i
was
literally
just
searching
that
up
are
you
a
psychic
[prabipyakurel]
Nooooo
…
[sskarz]
:
think
:
well
i
am
trying
it
rn
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Give
it
a
try
It
’
s
better
than
the
puzzle
At
least
in
my
opinion
[sskarz]
what
am
i
looking
at
😭
numbers
are
my
enemy
fr
[prabipyakurel]
So
all
those
6x6
boxes
that
don
’
t
have
a
4
need
a
4
All
those
9
small
boxes
just
have
one
of
each
number
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
😂
Maybe
watch
a
video
[sskarz]

game
is
way
too
big
brained
for
me
[prabipyakurel]

So

but
other
than

[sskarz]
Hold

My

made
chicken
tikka
Marsala
with
garlic
naan
and
I
was

happy
lol
Oooh

smart
You

print
a
map
if
you
can
just
in
the
rare
case
that
your
phone
dies
or
something
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
OOOO
yea
that
is
a
pretty
good
idea
OMG
That
sounds
so
good
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
was
so
good
,
boutta
get
a
food
coma
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
imagine
having
a
food
coma
I
mean
you
can
actually
just
sleep
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
of
you
dont
have
anything
else
to
do
.
maybe
give
that
a
try
[sskarz]
Aha
that
’
s
what
you
’
d
think
Me
looking
at
the
list
of
things
I
need
to
do
be
like
[prabipyakurel]
Its
like
that
sometimes
,
I
am
like
okay
tomorrow
I
can
rest
and
the
little
person
in
my
head
is
like
...
[sskarz]
💀
that
’
s
fr
me
I
will
take
a
break
for
an
hour
or
2
for
now
tho
My
voice
is
crackling
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
should
,
you
have
probably
been
talking
for
a
while
probably
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
been
a
couple
of
hours
lol
Omg
my
kids
from
last
year
also
joined
this
year
right
And
they
told
me
that
they
wish
they
could
come
to
class
in
person
because
they
thought
it
was
way
more
fun
doing
it
in
the
class
with
how
I
taught
And
I
was
like
mannnnnn
same
[prabipyakurel]
They
don
'
t
come
in
-
person
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
awesome
to
see
my
kids
from
last
year
be
the
best
students
in
this
year
Most
are
virtual
Only
3
people
come
to
class
in
person
The
36
other
students
join
virtually
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh
wow
,
I
thought
you
were
surrounded
by
like
50
kids
when
teaching
and
you
are
in
the
front
[sskarz]
Oh
nah
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
how
I
visualized
it
[sskarz]
I
wish
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Line
Up
[sskarz]
It
’
s
more
fun
to
teach
when
they
’
re
with
me
irl
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Like
did
is
your
perspective
😂
[sskarz]
Last
year
yeah
Not
this
year
tho
Sadly
Altho
last
year
I
only
had
12
students
Now
I
’
ve
got
close
to
40
🤯
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
is
still
a
lot
of
kids
to
handle
What
is
the
age
range
?
Like
of
the
kids
you
teach
?
[sskarz]
They
’
re
8
-
16
year
olds
Most
are
in
the
10
-
12
[prabipyakurel]
OOOO
nice
nice
,
that
is
quite
a
group
But
great
job
,
if
I
was
teaching
that
kid
range
I
would
have
been
on
the
news
for
abusing
a
kid
already
[sskarz]
what
😂
Nah
you
’
d
be
great
with
kids
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
see
me
a
week
alos
with
9
boys
at
my
house
.
I
was
watching
them
turn
my
house
upside
down
from
the
stairs
,
eating
the
food
💀
[sskarz]
They
just
wildin
I
mean
you
got
through
it
tho
Some
people
really
couldn
’
t
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
glad
,
that
day
was
wild
I
was
so
lost
after
a
while
I
mean
all
the
adults
decided
to
take
a
rug
outside
and
sit
so
basically
the
kids
inside
had
my
entire
house
as
a
playground
with
me
watching
[sskarz]
omg
i
would
literally
just
be
on
my
phone
and
pretend
the
world
around
me
is
just
a
figment
of
my
imagination
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
uh
,
when
there
is
food
and
kids
,
I
cannot
leave
them
alone
they
gonna
spill
something
and
the
bugs
are
gonna
take
over
the
next
day
I
cannot
risk
bugs
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fair
lol
so
what
'
re
your
plans
for
the
rest
of
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
,
actually
putting
away
the
lehengas
and
dresses
I
got
from
nepal
from
yesterday
Literally
I
put
it
in
my
parents
bedroom
because
I
was
too
tired
last
night
and
my
dad
will
give
me
the
death
state
if
he
comes
home
and
still
finds
it
there
[sskarz]
lmao
my
sister
got
in
trouble
like
a
few
days
ago
because
she
left
dresses
and
lehengas
in
our
parent
'
s
room
💀
[prabipyakurel]
I
be
doing
that
because
I
cant
have
it
in
my
room
,
i
need
clean
and
peace
to
sleep
and
they
got
that
closet
space
,
so
in
it
goes

a
different
story

of
disney
movies

except
mulan

i
'
ve
watched
it
a
crazy
amount
of
times
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

Like
I
never
hated
them
but
when
someone
asked
if
I
watched
like
Mulan
or
frozen

I
would
be
like
“

[sskarz]
yeah
also
they
be
pumping
out
movies
like
crazy
i
can
'
t
keep
up
and
it
all
feels
the
same
i
only
really
watch
them
if
i
'
m
in
a
setting
that
i
'
m
at
that
makes
me
watch
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
But

with
your
dad
'
s
name
and
came
first
[sskarz]
i
got
to
3rd
place
on
the
first
question
and
he
was
confused
too
like
he
doesn
'
t
remember
this
student
lmao
and
then
i
fell
to
the
bottom
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
I
mean
its
probably
a
lot
of
students
that
he
has
to
keep
tabs
on
[sskarz]
yeah
its
nuts
to
think
about
how
he
has
like
crazy
amounts
of
students
,
i
used
to
be
his
first
student
😭
there
'
s
like
a
picture
out
there
with
me
in
the
garage
working
with
him
when
i
was
like
12
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
i
wanna
seeeee
12
huh
,
voice
was
probably
so
high
too
[sskarz]
its
somewhere
out
there
,
i
'
ll
show
it
to
you
if
i
ever
come
across
it
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Dam
that
was
probably
a
while
back
[sskarz]
oh
i
had
such
a
high
pitched
voice
till
i
turned
like
16
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
[sskarz]
almost
7
years
ago
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
,
thats
cool
tho
,
how
you
did
that
at
a
young
age
brb
[sskarz]
oki
me
who
just
wanted
to
build
a
computer
*
i
got
dragged
along
for
7
years
*
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
But
hey
you
got
so
far
so
fast
,
like
dude
you
are
ahead
ahead
you
are
like
an
inspiration
to
all
those
interested
in
IT
[sskarz]
yeah
idk
where
the
time
went
im
like
ancient
now
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
hope

💀
[prabipyakurel]
you
gonna
be
pointing
to
the
computer
once
you
hit
20
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fr
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
you
are
,
like
I
am
sure
many
of
your
students
really
look
up
to
you
.
But
20
really
isnt
ancient
,
it
just
means
you
are
going
to
start
your
20s
lifestyle
[sskarz]
the
transition
to
30
the
midlife
crisis
chapter
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
got
like
9
years
after
to
be
30
Almost
a
decade
,
and
that
will
be
a
while
you
gonna
do
so
many
things
like
graduate
and
stuff
before
turning
30
[sskarz]
the
last
9
years
felt
like
9
minutes
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
thats
because
of
school
and
stuff
,
but
you
are
older
now
and
wiser
and
that
is
something
to
consider
.
[sskarz]
nah
im
just
playin
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
ik
,
you
are
a
brilliant
person
,
I
am
excited

[sskarz]

😂

like
3x
the
amount
of
work
i

a
daily
basis
he
'
s
crazy
for

👍
[prabipyakurel]
Remember

^
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
in
like
what
2
months
you
got
time
before
you
reach
that
stage
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
right
there
is
the
most
accurate
image
representing
my
life
[sskarz]
same
lmao
😂
so
are
you
fully
ready
for
your
trip
?
it
'
s
in
2
days
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
wouldn
'
t
say
fully
,
but
I
mean
I
have
to
go
,
and
it
will
hopefully
get
better
as
I
adjust
and
get
used
to
coming
back
every
once
in
a
while
.
Yep
in
2
days
[sskarz]
what
else
do
you
have
to
pack
?
[prabipyakurel]
Shampoo
and
tupperware
[sskarz]
ah
that
makes
sense
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
a
few
makeup
stuff
[sskarz]
are
your
roommates
already
there
?
or
will
you
be
the
first
[prabipyakurel]
i
am
not
sure
when
their
times
are
actually
,
I
need
to
message
them
,
but
they
take
a
while
getting
back
Hopefully
I
can
pick
first
though
,
like
I
need
the
bottom
bunk
[sskarz]
yeah
gotta
claim
it
first
👍
[prabipyakurel]
imma
throw
half
my
stuff
on
the
bed
,
desk
,
and
closet
of
my
choice
first
💯
When
does
uni
start
for
you
again
?
[sskarz]
the
21st
my
last
week
of
freedom
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
mines
too
[sskarz]
we
'
re
both
going
to
be
in
the
mud
haha
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[sskarz]
did
you
ever
get
your
classes
situation
sorted
out
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
no
,
every
class
that
I
check
to
switch
to
that
also
fufills
the
requirement
has
like
all
the
discussion
classes
waitlisted
already
.
And
I
checked
in
with
senior
and
juniors
there
and
they
said
that
I
should
be
fine
,
maybe
extra
reading
or
essays
,
but
other
than
that
I
think
its
okay
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
that
'
s
great
to
hear
❤
️
did
your
advisor
/
counselor
get
back
to
you
regarding
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
she
said
to
filter
it
out
and
keep
looking
but
I
have
those
classes
set
with
no
time
conflicts
and
I
am
not
gonna
put
myself
through
that
again
.
But
I
checked
professor
rating
and
made
a
list
of
how
they
all
are
and
what
to
expect
.
Nothing
too
scary
[sskarz]
ok
good
what
was
the
lowest
rating
on
a
professor
that
you
have
?

[prabipyakurel]
And

better
than

[sskarz]
i
was
supposed
to
take
a
history
class
this
semester
but
i
didn
'
t
because
all
of
the
professors
had
like
2
star
reviews
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
BS
my
way
thoruh
it
[sskarz]
oh
that
'
s
facts
[prabipyakurel]
OOO
yea
,
make
sure
you
choose
a
good
one
[sskarz]
i
might
have
to
take
it
at
PCC
or
something
so
i
can
avoid
those
guys
😭
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
I
doubt
the
professor
will
go
deeply
into
100
students
essays
,
open
notes
too
Can
you
do
that
?
[sskarz]
yeah
berkeley
professors
ain
'
t
got
time
for
all
that
yup
and
its
cheaper
to
take
classes
there
in
the
summer
/
winter
than
at
campus
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhh
I
see
I
see
Yea
maybe
summer
term
is
the
way
to
go
for
history
But
knowing
you
,
you
got
this
!
[sskarz]
that
summer
is
gonna
be
a
snooze

painfully
i

Good

I

together
.
Yesterday
was
fun
.
I
saw
the
dogs
,
played
a
few
games
with
my
baby
cousins
,
listened
to
my
uncles
funny
college
stories
,
and
they
got
me
a
cute
little
cake
which
made
my
day
.
❤
️
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
awwwwwww
that
sounds
nice
❤
️
the
day
has
been
pretty
wild

2
days
worth
of
working
out
today
because
i
won
'
t
be
able
to
tomorrow
so
im
like
exhausted
exhausted
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
2
days
worth
,
how
many
hours
did
you
spend
?
[sskarz]
almost
3
i
did
an
hour
and
a
half
of
chest
shoulders
and
triceps
,
and
then
another
hour
and
a
half
with
a
buddy
of
mine
doing
all
lower
body
while
on
300
mg
of
caffeine
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
idea
how
any
of
that
works
but
seems
like
quite
a
workout
lol
Ahhh
caffine
is
good
[sskarz]
essentially
im
like
dead
af
yeah
i
just
chugged
some
coffee
in
the
morning
and

through
it
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]

your
last
day
being
here

'
re
you
feeling
?
rn
yea
lmao
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Sad
but
now
kind
of
looking
forward
to
it
in
a
way
.
I
feel
like
I
am
ready
now
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
still
scary
.
I
don
'
t
really
have
a
word
to
describe
how
I
am
feeling
and
feel
as
if
I
am
always
repeating
myself
when
you
ask
how
I
feel
about
leaving
but
its
like
that
unknown
feeling
(
good
nor
bad
).
[sskarz]
haha
I
know
I
keep
asking
,
just
wanted
to
see
if
your
outlook
had
changed
at
all
I
didn
'
t
mean
to
pressure
you
you
'
re
going
in
with
a
better
mindset
though
,
at
least
you
feel
ready
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
No
I
appreaciate
you
asking
,
lol
only
few
people
do
that
to
others
in
life
.
Not
at
all
lol
,
I
appreciate
it
when
you
check
up
on
me
every
once
in
a
while
,
its
gives
me
time
to
reflect
and
think
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
then
I
will
continue
to
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks

stuff
into
that
car
and
check
any
last
minute
items
.
[sskarz]

af
:
EYE

[prabipyakurel]
I
still
feel
like
I
am
going
to
forget
something
even
with
so
much
preparation
[sskarz]
its
inevitable
lol
,
just
make
sure
you
got
your
necessities
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
its
the
easiest
thing
to
make
at
the
moment
.
For
sure
,
thanks
!
[sskarz]
your
car
is
full
of
gas

[prabipyakurel]
That
is
my
dad
'
s
problem
,
but
yes
I
am
assuming
so
too
😂
[sskarz]

pack
a
whole
bunch
of
water
bottles
too
long
road
so
you
'
re

O
this
whole
time
i
thought

[prabipyakurel]
Nope
Thats
why
it
will
be
difficult
for
me
to
come
back
home
because
I
got
to
make
sure
someone
can
drive
to
come
pick
me
up
from
LA
.
[sskarz]
ooof
that
one
person
is
gonna
hate
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
Ooo
yesterday
I
got
a
picture
with
one
of
the
dogs
,
it
toook
me
a
while
before
I
was
comfortable
that
it
wont
bite
me
,
but
I
did
it
.
[sskarz]
omg
she
did
it
,
she
got
close
to
dogs
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
I
was
so
surprised
too
It
just
stared
at
me
but
I
got
it
to
stare
at
the
camera
eventually
[sskarz]
hahaha
can
i
see
?
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
why
the
dog
'
s
eyes
look
like
they
'
re
about
to
pop
out
💀
[prabipyakurel]
😂
idk
they
have
been
like
that
this
one
is
the
jumpy
one
,
There
was
another
one
but
it
went
upstairs
because
it
doesnt
like
loud
noises
lol
[sskarz]
just
like
me
fr
😂
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
,
that
'
s
my
dog
too
he
gets
scared
of
plastic
bubble
wrap
[prabipyakurel]
like
scared
scared
or
like
just
meh
[sskarz]
he
backs
up
a
considerable
distance
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Those
things
are
so
fun
to
play
with
though
[sskarz]
like
he
'
ll
go
to
a
wall
and
peek
out
in
case
its
gonna
blow
up
or
something
my
dog
can
'
t
take
anything
relative
to
a
popping
sound
👍
he
hates
it
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwww
So
if
he
comes
near
me
and
I
start
popping
the
bubble
wrap
,
he
will
go
away
right
?
[sskarz]
yep
probably
lol
hold
on
brb
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
aaaaaaaaand
im
back
a
list
of
chores
done
and
finally
sitting
down
again
whatcha
doing
?
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
what
would
you
say
is
your
most
favorite
and
least
favorite
chore
?
Just
curious
.
[sskarz]
Most
favorite
goes
to
vacuuming
:
simple
,
easy
,
and
I
can
wear
my
headphones
and
I
can
’
t
even
hear
the
vacuum
Least
favorite
:
cleaning
the
entire
backyard
I
think
that
speaks
for
itself
lol
👍
Wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
favorite
would
probably
be
wiping
down
the
kitchen
counters
,
oooo
when
you
get
a
stain
off
that
been
there
for
a
while
,
it
is
so
satisfying
.
The
worst
,
is
like
yours
,
backyard
,
I
sweep
halfway
and
the
wind
is
like
"
hello
there
"
Blows
all
the
leaves
around
again
[sskarz]
Oh
I
forgot
to
mention
,
backyard
gets
even
worse
when
my
dog
is
roaming
around
and
he
be
getting
too
close
for
me
to
sweep
😭
FRRRRR
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
he
is
just
there
walking
around
right
[sskarz]
and
my
dog
keeps
running
on
the
dead
leaves
so
they
all
crack
and
break
apart
,
making
more
of
a
mess
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhh
i
see
that
is
painful
and
u
guys
got
the
fake
grass
right
?
[sskarz]
Turf
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
fake
grass
lol
whatever
😂
[sskarz]
I
’
m
just
messing
with
ya
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
was
like
"
oh
my
god
,
i
forgot
that
word
existed
"
😂
[sskarz]
He
gets
his
ball
and
he
throws
it
near
my
feet
for
me
to
play
with
him
But
the
thing
is
,
if
I
throw
it
once
,
he
just
wants
to
play
And
then
follows
me
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
but
that
is
just
love
[sskarz]
And
he
makes
it
so
hard
to
clean
😭
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
give
him
food
inside
when
you
are
cleaning
outside
[sskarz]
He
will
most
certainly
make
it
a
disaster
😂
[prabipyakurel]
He
a
messy
eater
too
?
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
he
be
throwing
food
everywhere
😂
he
a
messy
boi
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
,
well
then
play
fetch
with
him
so
much
until
he
is
too
tired
to
move
and
then
get
to
cleaning
.
[sskarz]
the
universe
will
end
before
he
'
s
tired
of
playing
fetch
im
being
fr
that
boi
does
not
get
tired
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
dudes
got
that
energy
[sskarz]
he
can
either
be
the
laziest
boi
to
ever
exist
,
or
be
the
most
energized
doggo
around
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
that
power
also
applied
to
me
,
oh
the
places
I
would
go
…
[sskarz]
hahaha
same
i
see
why
adults
be
relying
on
caffeine

[prabipyakurel]

but
hopefully
everything

[prabipyakurel]
Hey
good
afternoon
,
it
’
s
been
a
day
.
I
just
got
into
my
dorm
and
now
we
are
eating
mono
and
then
they
will
leave
me
here
.
I
will
talk
to
you
in
a
bit
Hey
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
It
was
pretty
cool
,
helped
my
uncle
move
in
and
got
to
visit
my
old
house
again
after
years
but
i
'
ve
been
chilling
since
👍
how
about
you
?
how
did
the
move
go
and
how
are
you
feeling
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
thats
nice
,
it
must
have
felt
nostalgic
going
into
that
house
after
years
.
Well
I
just
got
done
with
fixing
everything
in
my
dorm
and
now
I
am
just
looking
through
emails
and
such
.
Sorry
I
didnt
get
back
to
you
in
the
morning
,
I
was
like
sobbing
and
walking
,
and
also
smiling
all
at
the
same
time
.
😭
[sskarz]
no
no
you
'
re
okay
!
I
know
you
were
going
through
a
lot
today
and
I
didn
'
t
want
to
interrupt
anything
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
was
weird
,
because
we
dropped
off
our
stuff
into
the
room
and
went
out
to
eat
so
they
can
leave
early
.
And
we
ate
momo
and
the
nepali
lady
was
pretty
nice
,
got
her
number
in
case
I
ever
needed
anything
.
But
like
the
moment
they
were
walking
me
back
to
my
dorm
,
like
midway
walking
I
looked
back
at
my
dad
and
started
bawling
.
Then
as
I
walked
I
was
crying
and
people
were
also
staring
at
me
too
.
It
has
been
that
tye
of
day
.
[sskarz]
are
you
feeling
any
better
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
whenever
I
call
them
I
freeze
,
you
know
that
feeling
where
you
will
start
crying
when
you
talk
and
you
can
feel
a
cry
starting
.
But
yes
thank
you
,
I
am
doing
a
lot
better
than
a
few
hours
ago
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
yeah
I
know
that
feeling
❤
️
it
'
ll
get
easier
have
you
met
your
dorm
mates
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
!
Um
yes
I
have
spent
the
past
2
hours
or
so
with
them
and
they
are
cool
,
we
will
get
along
just
fine
.
Also
,
I
only
opened
your
first
insta
post
and
thought
you
were
like
moving
again
,
and
then
like
an
hour
later
,
i
opened
the
other
ones
and
realized
lol
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
a
couple
of
my
friends
started
freaking
out
like
if
i
was
actually
moving
😂
😂
so
I
had
to
clarify
good
!
told
you
they
would
be
fine
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
have
mentioned
that
in
the
"
this
is
where
it
all
started
"
post
.
[sskarz]
I
definiteliy
should
have
lolol
but
I
did
get
some
funny
reactions
out
of
it
so
I
'
d
say
worth
it
[prabipyakurel]
Its
fun
messing
with
your
friends
like
that
[sskarz]
uninentionally
😭
[prabipyakurel]
I
did
that
to
my
friend
and
we
were
talking
and
I
was
like

I
am
moving
to
like
some
other
state
because
parents
wanted
to
so
I
wont
be
here
for
senior
year
and
kept
that
going
for
a
few
days
until
the
conversation
got
sad
then
I
confronted
him
and
said
sorry
.
Was
quite
interesting
and

thinking
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ik

not
met
the
mean

of
me
lol
its

😭
That
what

when
I

can
be
a
menace
I

💀
i
am
the
victim
of
said
gaslighting
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

that
easy
to
fool
?
[sskarz]
my
friends
have
taught
me
that
yes
,

i
am
they
are
ultimate
masterminds
of
gaslighting
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
have
been
getting
better
at
seeing
through
bs
tho
lol
my
smooth
brain
could
never
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
jokes
aside
,
you
should
like
see
through
things
too
.
[sskarz]
mhmm

i
can
be
dumb
as

so
now
that
you

re

at
the
dorms
,

re
you
going
to
manage
food
?
if
there
is
no
kitchen
to
work
with
other
than
the
public
one
[prabipyakurel]
Stick
to
dining
hall
meal
plans
to
save
time
but
maybe
I
can
eat
out
every
once
in
a
while
when
I
am
not
working
so
much
and
got
that
time
lol
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
yeah
I
forgot
those
exist
lol
have
you
tried
their
food
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
The
dining
hall

But

tonight
or
tomorrow
I
will
[sskarz]
ah
lmk
how
that
food
is
,
i
imagine
its
immaculate
if
its
at
berkeley
lol
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
I
have
heard
some
places
are
better
than
others
But
overall
not
the
best
[sskarz]

floor
mine
[sskarz]
The
5th
floor
?
oooh
wow
the
dorm
is
nice
on
the
outside
[prabipyakurel]
This
is
the
one
building
that
has
the
worst
facilities
But
yes
pretty
normal
from
the
outside
[sskarz]
oh
rip
is
the
AC
like
not
working
or
bad
water
?
[prabipyakurel]
I

not
as
clean
as

other
ones

long
weekends
.
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I

Ajisen
and
it
'
s
like
a
japanese
restaurant
and
they

yakisoba
,
one
of
my
favorite
restaurant
dishes
[prabipyakurel]
Well

lift
so
,
you
must
be
tired
[sskarz]
physically
and
mentally
yup
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh

I
had
heard
of
soba
noodles
,
similar
to
that
I
am
assuming
Me
everyday
💯
[sskarz]
yeah
yakisoba
is
just
a
different
type
of
soba
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
gotcha
[sskarz]

keep
it
real
around
here

lol
[sskarz]

you
had
japanese
food
?
[prabipyakurel]

’
s
probably
where

some
japanese
soba

preferred
type
of
noodles
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
maybe
the
have
a
spot
here
I
need
to
check
[sskarz]
you
probably
have
some
gems
around
your
uni
or
in
your
uni
that
has
great
food
it
took
me
a
while
to
find
out
that
i
had
a
smoothie
shop
on
campus
and
its
been
a
lifesaver
🙏
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
smoothies
are
good
Which
smoothie
do
you
get
?
Or
what
does
it
have
usually
?
[sskarz]
uhhh
they
have
this
one
option
where
its
like
caffeine
,
whey
protein
powder
,
mango
,
and
some
other
fruits
like
banana
,
all
blended
together
and
it
tastes
amazing
its
only
like
400
calories
and
it
fills
me
up
for
a
very
long
time
on
long
school
days
,
its
saved
me
so
many
times
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
yea
mango
and
banana
combo
is
pretty
good
I
need
to
look
around
,
but
when
my
friend
comes
tomorrow
,
I
will
.
[sskarz]
you
should
defiitely
explore
around
,
it
'
ll
take
your
mind
off
things
and
you
'
re
going
to
be
exploring
!
Plus
you
know
,
it
'
ll
help
you
get
adjusted
to
life
on
campus
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
what
I
am
going
to
do
,
I
feel
like
the
more
I
think
about
home
the
more
I
feel
sad
But
like
when
they
call
me
,
like
idk
it
feels
so
sad
.
And
my
brother
calls
me
crying
and
then
I
start
crying
and
it
ends
sadly
.
But
yea
tomorrow

get
my
mind
fresh
and
explore
.

[prabipyakurel]
Start

…
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
😂
You

any
major
plans
before
uni
starts
?
[sskarz]
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
literally
me
when
someone
asks
me
what
I
got
planned
for
the
future
😂
[sskarz]
i
wanted
to
invite
my
friends
over
while
playing
some
cool
party
games
and
pizza
just
something
before
we
all
have
to
go
to
school
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
that
sounds
nice
,
you
should
do
it
up
until
like
midnight
and
share
like
ghost
stories
and
stuff
👻
[sskarz]
i
wish
i
could
have
friends
over
for
that
long
my
parents
get
angsty
if
they
stay
past
like
7
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
gotcha
lol
,
I
think
Indian
parents
have
a
problem
when
friends
come
over
for
longer
than
a
few
hours
They
be
like
”
will
they
live
with
us
now
”
[sskarz]
frrrrrrr
the
one
time
my
friends
have
stayed
longer
than
7
pm
was
when
my
parents
went
to
go
travel
and
we
built
my
PC
that
'
s
about
it
did
your
parents
allow
you
to
have
like
sleepovers
and
stuff
?
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
right
and
the
bajan
started
playing
😂
[sskarz]
YES
LOL
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Um
no
if
it
was
at
a
Nepali
persons
house
and
they
knew
them
,
I
think
so
,
but
other
than
that
it
was
a
strict
no
.
You
?
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
never
had
a
sleepover
at
someone
'
s
house
or
in
my
own
if
it
wasn
'
t
family
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
u
first
😂
Stupid
autocorrect
[sskarz]
my
parents
have
a
strict
policy
of
like
friends
can
come
over
for
a
short
time
,
but
no
sleepovers
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
was
with
me
too
Actually
now
that
I
think
about
it
,
it
really
has
just
been
cousins
or
family
for
sleep
overs
[sskarz]
but
then
my
parents
would
also
allow
me
to
stay
at
a
friends
house
for
pretty
long
,
just
no
sleeping
over
yep
same
brown
parents
be
like
[prabipyakurel]
They
be
willing
to
wait
for
us
tho
Literally
all
of
them
Omg
so
Monday
we
were
looking
through
old
pictures

i

fell
towards
me

and
I
had
to
swerve
out
of

into
another
lane

avoid

the
best
for
students

according
to
this
ai
generated
video
of
patrick

the
harlem
shake
,

clearly
see
why
climate
change
is
affecting
our
world
by
a
large
degree
[prabipyakurel]
Hahaha
I
cannot
wait
to
encounter
kids

The
future

not
bright
for
students
in
this
generation

has
the
worst
topic
of
what
the
artist
is
talking
about
but
I
still
vibe
to
it
If
it
sounds
nice
,
then
I
listen
to
it
tbh
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Fr
though
,
like
they
will
be
mentioning
some
serious
stuff
in
the
lyrics
and
I
am
there
vibing
and
cooking
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
be
listening
to
an
artist
brag
about
drugs
and
money
and
I
’
m
just
doing
random
chores
and
vibing
lol
Maybe
you
’
ll
click
with
an
artist
or
genre
that
you
really
like
and
find
that
favorite
song
or
album
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
,
I
mean
the
only
one
I
listen
to
most
rn
is
Ariana
grande
But
like
her
song
lyrics
aren
’
t
deep
to
me
Just
like
her
music
[sskarz]
Ah
Do
you
like
listening
to
songs
with
deep
lyrics
?
[prabipyakurel]
Sometimes
,
but
she
be
saying
like
about
her
past
relationships
and
how
she
grew
and
I
be
listening
to
her
like
it
’
s
a
biography
.
Im
like
I
ain
’
t
got
no
story
like
this
,
it
makes
no
sense
😭
💀
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
I
get
that
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
it
’
s
just
her
music
is
upbeat
and
energetic
[sskarz]
Oh
so
you
’
re
more
into
that
style
Hmmmm
I
’
m
trying
to
think
of
who
brings
that
vibe
[prabipyakurel]
Like
yea
mention
people
who
talk
about
things
other
than
being
heartbroken
in
their
songs
Maybe
fear
of
failing
college
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Nah
you
got
into
your
dream
school
,
so
you
gotta
bring
this

I

I

realizing
that
I
don

have
many
upbeat
songs
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
but
hey
maybe
you
can
find
reasons
to
start
looking
for
them
Think
about
all
the
positive
things
that
have
happened
to
you
so
far
and
find
songs
relating
to
that
[sskarz]
Yeah
but
like
,
most
of
the
songs
that
I
listen
to
are
very
laid
back
Not
really
upbeat
or
energetic
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh

yes

are

getting
up
extra
early
for
that
starting
tomorrow
.
For
lunch
they
had
food
trucks
so
i
got
chicken
and
rice
which
was
amazing
considering
I
didn
'
t
have
breakfast
,
and
we
went
to
the
stadium
for
a
pep
talk
thing
.
And

roped
into
it
[prabipyakurel]

to
yell
at
it
to
eat
and
the
dog
eats
it
afterward
But
next
time
you
catch
him
eating
a
bee
,
take
a
video
[sskarz]
Oh

one
was
hilarious
😂
I

ate
it
and
swallowed
so
fast
💀
[prabipyakurel]

swallowed
it
???
And
had
no
reaction
?
[sskarz]
Lightwork
no
reaction
seems
like
he
’
s
experienced
lol
[prabipyakurel]
He
has
been
secretly
eating
them
,
its
like
his
day
snack
lol
[sskarz]
Honestly
I
wouldn
’
t
be
surprised
He
will
eat
anything
and
everything
[prabipyakurel]
Which
is
why
i
would
not
to
near
him
[sskarz]
Ok
but
he
wouldn
’
t
eat
you
💀
[prabipyakurel]

I
am
the
perfect
size
for
the
thing
[sskarz]

But

He

shoulders
And

He

I
finally
got
to
rest
after
my
club
meetup
how
'
s
your
day
been
going
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
sorry
for
getting
back
late
,
I
went
to
see
some
magician
do
a
magic
show
.
My
day
has
gone
smooth
,
nothing
too
crazy
,
how
about
you
?
[sskarz]
No
worries
!
A
magician
show
sounds
really
fun
!
Did
you
enjoy
it
?
My
day
was
pretty
chill
,
got
to
hang
out
with
some
club
members
and
had
a
nice
pizza
party
.
Nothing
too
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
was
pretty
fun
and
interesting
.
Pizza
is
always
nice
,
what
kind
of
pizza
was
it
?
[sskarz]
Costco
pizza
it
was
bomb
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
,
those
are
huge
They
are
like
industrial
size
😂
😂
[sskarz]
yeah
we
got
5
boxes
[prabipyakurel]
How
many
of
you
were
there
[sskarz]
there
were
like
20
of
us
we
had
like
2
boxes
left
over
and
i
got
$
40
for
free
[prabipyakurel]
5
boxes
for
20
people
Crazy
[sskarz]
ik
i
told
the
president
it
was
overkill
[prabipyakurel]
What
did
you
get
40
dollars
for
?
[sskarz]
but
i
don
'
t
make
the
plans
so
they
cut
me
a
check
for
$
100
to
pick
up
the
boxes
and
then
they
said
that
I
could
keep
the
remainder
for
myself
so
i
was
like
hell
yeahhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
well
that
is
nice
of
them
[sskarz]
mhmmmmmm
instantly
used
that
money
to
buy
something
i
totally
didn
'
t
need
[prabipyakurel]
Everyone
be
screaming
like
that
when
you
get
free
money
💯
Best
Buy
???
[sskarz]
nahhh
amazon
[prabipyakurel]
And
what
did
you
get
exactly
?
[sskarz]
i
just
got
some
protein
shake
drinks
pack
of
12
works
wonders
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
mean
,
that
’
s
not
a
bad
investment
At
least
you
aren
’
t
buying
them
with
another
12
pack
so
it
won
’
t
be
lonely
😆
😂
[sskarz]
mhmmm
they
are
so
good
hella
expensive
tho
$
30
for
a
12
pack
is
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
tbh
idk
why
people
like
them
so
much
,
but
it
’
s
probably
because
I
have
only
had
them
like
twice
[sskarz]
yeah
these
go
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
have
never
had
those
,
I
have
only
had
like
one
of
those
white
ones
In
vanilla
tho
I
think
Anyway
,
what
are
you
doing
rn
?
[sskarz]
oh
those
don
'
t
taste
nearly
as
good
you
gotta
have
the
fairlife
stuff
👍
playing
DND
with
some
of
my
buddies
Dungeons
and
Dragons
idk
if

of
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh

thing
Yep

of
it
[sskarz]

of
a
nerdy
thing
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Friend

beginner
and
my
friends
are

[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
my
life
’
s
motto
.
I
mean
you
will
probably
eventually
catch
on
.
[sskarz]

'
s
what

[prabipyakurel]
Lol

[prabipyakurel]
Well

silent
disco
thing
with
headphones
and
stuff
,
so
I
am
here
alone
.
[sskarz]

went
to
a
rave
??
[prabipyakurel]
Ig
kinda
yea
[sskarz]
dayum
that
was
fast
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
can
see
people
walking
and
stuff
from
my
window
[sskarz]
they
all
have
headphones
on
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
they
leave
late
night
activities
for
orientation
Yep
[sskarz]
that
'
s
pretty
dope
[prabipyakurel]
From
what
I
see
on
insta
,
it
looks
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
why
not
join
them
?
sounds
like
fun
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
not
a
person
that
wants
to
go
out
this
late
into
the
night
I
am
barely
getting
started
here
,
don
’
t
wanna
really
go
out
past
9
yet
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fair
[prabipyakurel]
Dis
what
it
looks
like
[sskarz]
oh
I
see
its
literally
just
everyone
outside
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
I
thought
it
was
more
of
an
indoor
thing
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
it
’
s
like
open
But
like
when
I
look
down
my
window
rn
,
people
still
be
walking
and
stuff
down
there
[sskarz]
oh
i
seeeee
dang
campus
looks
like
fun
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
kinda
scary
,
I
didn
’
t
really
expect
to
see
this
kind
of
stuff
here
but
here
we
are
[sskarz]
yeah
the
college
experience
is
gonna
be
wild
compared
to
you
,
its
hella
boring
over
here
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
’
m
sure
it
’
s
not
boring
,
I
think
every
school
has
their
own
way
of
doing
stuff
.
Oh
for
sure
[sskarz]
i
wish
,
its
just
go
to
class
,
come
back
do
hw
,
study
,
and
boom
that
'
s
it
i
'
m
not
really
a
party
guy
so
i
don
'
t
attend
that
kind
of
stuff
so
its
pretty
boring
out
here
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
yea
likewise
,
I
get
a
bad
feeling
about
big
parties
,
especially
late
into
the
night
Like
I
need
a
group
of
people
that
I
know
to
be
there
and
not
worry
[sskarz]
mhmmm
that
'
s
true
gotta
keep
yourself
safe
some
parties
are
a
little
too
wild
out
here
so
I
'
m
just
not
planning
on
attending
any
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
’
s
a
safe
thing
to
do
Especially
a
party
in
college
Nope
[sskarz]
yeah
so
what
'
re
your
plans
for
the
rest
of
tonight
?
or
really
the
weekend
I
should
be
asking
[prabipyakurel]
Tonight

,
and
as
per
the
weekend
,

nepali

by
A

[sskarz]
rightttttttttttttt
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
feel
like

a
blur
and
this
one
be
lingering
around
for
ages
[sskarz]
ikr
omg
finally
someone
else
thinks
this
way
❤
️
2023
has
felt
like
a
drag
yet
im
doing
some
of
the
most
work
i
'
ve
ever
done
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
it
was
only
me
for
a
while
because
I
transitioned
to
college
but
glad
to
hear
I
am
not
the
only
one
😅
You
certainly
are
,
but
like
remember
to
take
care
of
yourself
and
drop
unnecessary
things
.
[sskarz]
mhmmmmmm
yeah
idk
i
just
wanna
see
what
life
looks
like
in
5
years
i
wishhhhhhhhhhhhhh
like
sometimes
i
be
wondering
if
the
things
im
doing
is
going
to
have
a
massive
impact
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
For
real
,
but
like
your
future
would
be
really
good
in
my
opinion
,
you

all
the
right
things
.
And
of
course
you
will
make
an
impact
,
hell
you
are
probably
changing
the
lives
of
your
students
as
you
teach
them
.
You
are
doing
amazing
and
other
people
your
age
are
probably
out
there
partying
and
sniffing
stuff
.
❤

Those

every
Nepali
kids
house
with
one
of
those
Nepali
curtains
You
need
to
do
something
about
those
white
marks
on
top
.
[sskarz]
yeah
that
is
what
my
previous
curtains
were
hanging
on
,
like
on
screws
but
I
'
m
gonna
have
to
paint
it
off
[prabipyakurel]
Yes

too
But
the
blinds
look
really
cool
[sskarz]
mhmmm
and
they
save
so
much
more
space
on
my
bedside
[prabipyakurel]
Yes

hanging
or
anything
Looks
clean
[sskarz]

join
them
👍
mhmmm
caffeine
will
keep
me
energized
till
lunch
😂
😂
oh
and
another
note
,
I
really
wanted
to
share
this
with
you
💀
My
classes
got
released
on
canvas
and
this
was
on
one
of
my
class
'
syllabus
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
That
is
scary
[sskarz]
yeah
and
my
friends
also
got
the
same
professor
and
we
are
all
contemplating
moving
classes
if
that
'
s
even
possible
at
this
point
lol
like
damn
whyyyyyyyy
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
not
right
,
I
am
so
sorry
you
have
that
,
dw
I
pray
that
you
get
to
switch
🙏
But
at
least
you
have
friends
to
suffer
with
if
you
are
stuck
there
[sskarz]
honestly
true
did
you
get
classes
with
your
friends
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
All
alone
All
of
them
[sskarz]

opportunity
for
new
friends
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Hopefully
I
will
probably
make
it
really
awkward
tho
😂
[sskarz]

don
'
t
,
you
'
re
a
very
social
person
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

It
’
s
scary
talking
to
new
people
Lunch
looks
questionable
and
tastes
idk

off
I
don
’
t
think
the
bhat
is
properly
cooked
to
Nepali
standards
😂
[sskarz]

my
part

today
lol
[prabipyakurel]

can
with
old
papers
haha
[prabipyakurel]
You

Monday

[sskarz]

hesitant
because
of
this
hurricane
my
campus
released
a
statement
that
basically
read
:
"
lol

go
during
the
hurricane
"
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhh

of
places

out
notices

not
have
a
first

[sskarz]
but

probably
going
to
be
a
rocky
start
to
the
year
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
the
rain
is
fun
tho
,
could
be
quite
an
experience
[sskarz]
a
hurricane
does
not
sound
like
a
fun
experience
😂
yeah
you
should
come
down
and
experience
it
for
yourself
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Only
one
way
to
find
out
,
go
Sanskar
How

I
watch
you
experience
it
from
a
safe
distance
[sskarz]

It

a
piece
of
cake

Maybe

so
bad
that
it
is
easy
[sskarz]
ahhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
don
’
t
stress
out
about
it
,
once
you
go
through
like
the
1st
assignment
,
you
will
get
in
the
hang
of
it
[sskarz]

like
the
plan
👍

👋
[sskarz]
Damn
California
mountains
are
so
dryyy
but
the
view
is
pretty
good
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
they
fr
so
ugly
Yea
it
looked
pretty
from
up
there
[sskarz]
I
’
m
guessing
it
was
also
freezing
up
there
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nah
,
it
probably
was
,
but
I
was
like
burning
,
I
took
off
my
jacket
when
we
started
If
you
were
there
walking
with
me
on
that
hike
,
you
would
have
left
me
.
That
is
how
slow
I
was
going
.
😂
[sskarz]
I
would
not
leave
you
hahaha
,
I
’
d
probably
be
going
as
slow
as
you
😂
The
hike
cardio
go
crazyyy
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
I
felt
like
I
was
so
out
of
shape
,
I
should
probably
start
going
to
the
gym
and
all
[sskarz]
YESSSSS
join
the
gym
club
👍
it
’
s
fun
trust
great
for
the
physical
and
mental
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
as
soon
as
my
life
is
normalish
here
,
I
will
probably
start
looking
for
one
👍
[sskarz]
Your
uni
probably
has
one
included
Wait
no
it
most
definitely
has
one
and
it
’
s
like
fancy
👍
Omg
so
I
have
a
story
that
just
happened
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
me
Me
wants
to
know
[sskarz]
So
rn
I
’
m
at
Pasadena
charging
my
dads
car
,
and
I
was
like
,
I
’
m
kind
of
hungry
so
I
’
m
gonna
go
to
this
local
sandwich
shop
to
eat
something
then
leave
right
.
As
I
’
m
walking
down
the
street
,
I
notice
someone
behind
me
walking
with
clanging
keys
to
his
side
so
I
could
tell
how
far
or
close
he
was
.
Like
10
minutes
go
by
as
I
walk
and
he
’
s
slowly
walking
faster
towards
me
and
I
’
m
matching
his
speed
to
walk
away
from
him
as
he
’
s
trailing
.
Then
I
hear
the
keys
clanging
a
lot
more
and
I
hear
fast
footsteps
behind
me
,
so
I
literally
stepped
to
my
right
closer
to
the
street
and
I
see
him
with
his
shoulder
front
,
going
right
where
I
was
walking
like
his
plan
was
to
tackle
me
.
He
screams
“
ESE
,
DO
YOU
FUCKING
SPEAK
ENGLISH
MOTHERFUCKER
”
and
I
glance
at
him
before
I
start
running
the
other
way
,
and
getting
the
dial
for
911
ready
.
And
then
after
about
20
seconds
of
running
as
hard
as
I
could
,
I
look
behind
me
and
he
was
long
gone
.
If
I
hadn
’
t
dodged
to
the
side
,
he
was
planning
to
tackle
me
to
the
ground
like
a
psycho
So
I
walked
back
to
my
car
and
now
I
’
m
here
Wild
wild
experience
He
was
on
some
shit
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
first
of
all
,
that
’
s
scary
and
crazy
,
hope
you
are
okay
.
He
probably
was
on
something
Jeez
,
yea
im
glad
you
ran
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
had
no
idea
if
he
had
some
kind
of
weapon
so
I
just
ran
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
That
must
have
scared
you
,
yea
be
careful
next
time
,
maybe
don
’
t
go
out
at
night
like
that
alone
too
much
.
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
reach
the
local
shop
too
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
he
did
who
knows
,
yea
no
that
scared
me
all
the
way
over
here
.
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
’
s
okay
,
I
’
m
okay
and
well
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
glad
to
hear
,
did
you
get
the
food
though
?
[sskarz]
Oh
nah
I
ran
back
to
my
car
I
’
ll
just
drive
there
instead
[prabipyakurel]
No
don
’
t
drive
there
,
lol
drive
somewhere
else
[sskarz]
hmmm
probably
a
better
idea
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
back
home
and
eat
whatever
is
in
the
pantry
[sskarz]
Mmm
I
would
but
my
dad
said
he
would
pay
for
dinner
sooooooo
[prabipyakurel]
Was
he
with
you
[sskarz]
Nope
,
he
sent
me
to
go
charge
his
car
at
a
charging
network
Just
me
here
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
,
yea
be
careful
out
there
,
crazy
people
walking
around
rn
[sskarz]
Yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
home
now
?
[sskarz]
nope
I
’
m
still
charging
😭
I
’
m
just
sitting
in
the
car
need
to
have
the
car
ready
for
tomorrow
in
case
the
hurricane
does
something
and
we
need
a
transportation
vehicle
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
,
but
yea
stay
in
the
car
,
and
this
happened
like
a
short
while
ago
?
[sskarz]
Literally
5
mins
ago
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[sskarz]
I
was
responding
to
one
of
your
messages
while
that
all
happened
lol
wild
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
yea
if
you
didn
’
t
notice
,
he
would
have
probably
done
something
[sskarz]
Gotta
stay
aware
of
all
of
your
surroundings
all
senses
All
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
,
this
is
why
I
am
scared
to
wander
out
alone
[sskarz]
If
you
ever
have
to
,
bring
pepper
spray
or
some
defense
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
have
any
self
defense
than
calling
911
I
should
probably
get
myself
pepper
spray
[sskarz]
Yes
you
definitely
should
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
for
sure
,
lol
I
always
afraid
someone
will
ask
me
something
and
like
take
me
away
.
[sskarz]
Sometimes
911
takes
too
long
and
you
need
to
defend
yourself
in
that
moment
Me
too
,
but
sometimes
I
think
about
how
I
can
take
them
on
and
my
odds
of
winning
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
please
do
not
ever
try
that
,
run
to
someone
,
don
’
t
take
them
on
[sskarz]
No
no
I
won
’
t
but
yk
,
as
a
guy
I
think
about
these
things
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Better
to
get
help
or
defend
yourself
and
run
👍
No
matter
how
strong
you
are
(
and
how
many
times
you
go
to
the
gym
),
run
,
and
keep
running
.
[sskarz]
The
gym
gains
about
to
come
in
clutch
😂
[prabipyakurel]
😂
well
glad
to
hear
you
are
safe
,
but
how
was
your
day
at
the
gym
?
[sskarz]
Oh
my
god
horrible
,
I
felt
so
horrible
afterwards
,
10
/
10
I
got
home
and
literally
passed
out
for
an
hour
😵
‍
💫
[prabipyakurel]
And
did
you
eat
?
[sskarz]
It
was
a
2
hour
session
[prabipyakurel]
2
hours
damn
[sskarz]
I
had
some
kebab
and
bhat
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
felt
powerful
after
that
and
then
got
home
and
slept
like
a
baby
😂
❤
️
Hey
that
sounds
good
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
my
buddy
brought
his
girlfriend
so
we
all
trained
together
,
took
longer
than
usual
👍
Oh
you
know
it
Was
**
fantastic
**
There
’
s
this
restaurant
called
California
Kebab
Kitchen
that
my
family
loves
,
and
my
parents
brought
me
a
platter
so
I
gladly
had
that
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
we
had
rice
and
chicken
but
I
thought
it
was
all
beef
,
so
I
just
ate
plain
rice
and
2
cookies
😭
[sskarz]
rip
,
did
you
find
out
it
was
chicken
afterwards
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
found
out
after
I
was
done
[sskarz]
Awwww
damn
You
strictly
avoid
beef
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
in
the
evening
my
aunt
had
brought
fried
rice
and
watermelon
,
so
I
just
had
some
of
that
rn
.
[sskarz]
Oh

’
s
really
nice
of
her
,

lives
nearby

[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
don
’
t
ever
eat
it
,
I
have
accidentally
had
it
,
but
I
didn
’
t
know
.
But

Last

t

He

t

on
your
own
[sskarz]
he
expects

[prabipyakurel]
Valid

[prabipyakurel]
Yea
get
ready
for
a
brown
parent
lecture
[sskarz]
oh
and
your
wish
came
true
so
my
uncle
apparently
drove
all
the
way
from
irvine
and
he
brought
his
dog
and
he
held
him
in
the
garage
right
and
then
i
had
to
drive
to
the
grocery
store
,
so
when
i
opened
up
the
garage
to
take
the
car
our
,
the
dog
ran
out
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
HEAVY
RAINNNNNN
so
i
ran
after
him
and
i
got
a
hold
of
him
and
carried
him
back
,
and
got
***
SOAKED
***
[prabipyakurel]
I
knew
it
[sskarz]
that
was
not
a
fun
start
to
my
morning
💀
[prabipyakurel]
How

the
rain

[sskarz]

it

dog
ran
outside
[prabipyakurel]
Did

little
[sskarz]

crevice

Karma

after
that
shower
💀
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]

it
raining
where

?
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
have
recorded
yourself
in
that
rain
,
so
you
know
in
case
you
slipped
it
would
have
been
a
funny
moment

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
woahhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
really
understand
,
but
I
am
trying
based
on
what
I
know
[sskarz]
so
basically
one
team
has
to
hit
the
ball
and
run
,
the
other
team
has
to
catch
that
ball
and
get
their
team
out
if
a
person
runs
the
entire
field
,
they
score
a
point
for
the
team
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
know
that
😂
[sskarz]
oh
💀
if
u
know
that
then
u
should
be
fine
damn
its
so
sunny
out
there
[prabipyakurel]
Also
i
missed
one
of
your
replies
because
if
my
signal

a
good
chunk
of
it
,
that
’
s
why
I
was
so
confused
[sskarz]
the
sun
does
not
exist
over
here
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
missed
this
entire
thing
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
but
those
flowers
look
real
nice
.
[sskarz]
yeah
but
i
have
to
climb
onto
the
roof
to
water
them
jk
jk
they
'
re
fake
[prabipyakurel]
Why
not
open
the
window
Bruh
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
swear
[sskarz]
what
you
actually
believed
that
for
a
second
?
hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
lol
I
was
like
who
goes
onto
the
roof
to
water
plants
[sskarz]
me
fr
fr
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
looks
like
the
type
of
weather
to
stay
in
bed
and
have
coffee
and
watch
something
.
Like
a
snuggle
day
[sskarz]
its
a
day
FOR
THE

[prabipyakurel]
Of
course

sight
of
your
goals

gotta
push
through
the
rough
to
achieve
greatness
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
stop
if
you
slip
and
fall
and
injure
yourself
out
there
[sskarz]
this
is
why
cars
exist
💀
[prabipyakurel]

about
it
but
i
want
something
like
like

was
thinking
more
on
the
lines
of
interstellar
or
inception
or
*
any
christopher
nolan
directed
film
*
saving
private
ryan
maybe
something
classic

for
it
[sskarz]
NO
WAYYYYYYYYYY

'
ve
never
watched
Inception
,
Interstellar
,

and
Saving
Private
Ryan
is
arguably
the
most
recognized
classic
movies
especially
Interstellar
,
life
changing

'
s
why
im
a
super
big
fan
of
Christopher

t
miss
on
making
absolute
classics

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

That
’
s
what
dinner
will
look
like
for
me
ig
[sskarz]
im
ngl
i
thought
berkeley

have
more
gourmet
options
[prabipyakurel]
Gourmet
oh
please
bahhh
[sskarz]
hahahaha
well
you
pay
so
much
for
tuition
u
know
i
'
d
expect
a
little
more
idk
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
I
expect
more
from
22
,
000
that
I
paid
(
or
that
my
scholarship
paid
).
[sskarz]
oh
is
your
tuition
fully
covered
?
by
the
scholarship
[prabipyakurel]
Tuition
yea
[sskarz]
i
forgot
if
you
told
me
omg
that
'
s
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
a
scholarship
of
35
,
000
and
tuition
is
15
,
000
I
think
[sskarz]
15k
per
semester
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
yearly
[sskarz]
oh
ok
that
'
s
way
better
i
was
like
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
15k
semester
nah
[sskarz]
ain
'
t
no
way
that
would
be
insane
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
fafsa
and
Pell
grant
got
me
absolutely
nothing
like
prob
2
,
000
max
,
the
rest
were
grants
and
cal
grants
and
random
scholarships
How
much
do
you
pay
yearly
?
[sskarz]
about
6k
[prabipyakurel]
If
you
want
to
share
,
it
’
s
okay
if
you
don
’
t
.
[sskarz]
nah
i
'
m
open
with
stuff
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
not
bad
Is
that
everything
included
?
[sskarz]
Well
that
’
s
just
tuition
💀
But
since
I
’
m
doing
my
integrated
masters
program
,
there
’
s
no
added
tuition
with
that
So
I
get
both
degrees
with
a
year
extra
and
no
extra
cost
than
if
I
just
did
5
years
for
a
bachelors
To
be
honest
,
I
just
want
to
live
my
life
after
college
debt
free
and
*
mostly
*
done
with
formal
education
Which
is
exactly
why
I
went
with
the
program
that
I
did
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
that
sounds
like
a
great
plan
honestly
,
yea
you
got
this
.
Yea
I
can
’
t
wait
to
be
done
with
bachelors
and
go
to
law
school
.
[sskarz]
How
many
years
at
law
school
?
[prabipyakurel]
3
[sskarz]
Dangggg
You
’
re
in
it
for
the
long
run
haha
That
’
s
7
years
of
straight
education
(
assuming
you
don
’
t
take
a
break
year
)
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
no
breaks
I
will
take
a
break
after
I
graduate
the
last
one
[sskarz]
I
respect
that
,
but
do
keep
in
mind
that
if
it
ever
gets
to
an
extreme
level
of
stress
and
bad
things
,
always
an
option
And
after
law
school
it
’
s
the
Bar
exam
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
You
gotta
pass
that
,
then
get
sworn
in
to
the
state
[sskarz]
Damn
Yeah
that
’
s
as
far
as
my
knowledge
of
becoming
a
lawyer
goes
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
are
correct
[sskarz]
There
was
a
time
in
my
life
where
I
seriously
considered
becoming
a
lawyer
,
and
that
was
solely
due
to
the
fact
that
I
really
liked
debate
class
Then
I
learned
about
all
that
and
I
’
m
ngl
,
I
don
’
t
have
the
patience
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
,
I
mean
you
can
be
an
IT
guy
and
a
lawyer
[sskarz]
The
way
I
would
lose
all
my
cases
for
my
clients
and
get
kicked
out
of
a
law
firm
all
within
the
first
week
[prabipyakurel]
Well
if
you
ever
consider
it
,
we
will
be
in
it
together
,
would
be
fun
😊
No
losing
cases
won
’
t
kick
you
out
[sskarz]
Sorry
,
I
don
’
t
have
the
mental
capacity
for
that
😵
‍
💫
But
I
’
ll
be
cheering
you
on
as
you
go
on
your
journey
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
’
s
alright
,
honestly
speaking
sometimes
I
take
on
so
much
more
that
I
can
handle
and
end
up
forgetting
about
my
mental
state
in
the
process
.
Yea
and
it
scares
me
when
I
think
about
my
future
sometimes
.
Like
I
feel
like
I
will
mess
up
somewhere
and
end
up
doing
something
wrong
.
Sorry
lol
that
was
a
long
response
.
Thanks
!
[sskarz]
Hey
no
you
’
re
fine
,
I
like
when
you
can
lay
out
your
thoughts
.
And
don
’
t
worry
,
I
think
about
that
all
the
time
too
.
It
’
s
scary
and
feels
like
life
is
going
to
screw
you
up
somewhere
,
or
maybe
even
you
’
ll
screw
it
up
somehow
.
But
as
long
as
you
remember
that
you
’
re
in
control
of
your
own
future
and
whatever
goals
your
chasing
,
you
will
always
think
first
before
every
move
you
make
,
and
it
’
ll
be
easier
to
avoid
the
mistakes
along
the
way
.
Trust
me
,
you
’
ll
make
mistakes
and
you
’
ll
think
it
’
s
the
end
of
the
world
.
Been
there
,
done
that
,
over
it
.
It
’
s
never
over
,
and
the
mental
battle
to
think
like
that
is
the
hardest
.
In
time
,
you
’
ll
see
your
progress
as
a
college
student
and
you
’
ll
see
where
you
could
’
ve
done
better
.
Absolutely
you
will
.
But
it
’
s
important
to
keep
going
,
having
learned
from
your
mistakes
and
always
improving
❤
️
Keep
your
mental
state
in
check
too
!
Make
sure
you
’
re
content
with
how
you
’
re
living
your
life
and
if
not
,
make
changes
as
soon
as
possible
before
you
get
burnt
out
❤
️
This
is
what
I
’
ve
learned
having
been
in
college
as
an
adult
for
the
last
2
years
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
,
I
really
appreciate
it
.
And
for
sure
,
I
will
take
your
advice
.
And
thank
you
again
for
always
being
there
to
talk
to
me
,
yea
sometimes
I
go
on
and
on
,
and
you
always
make
me
feel
better
.

are
an
awesome
person

my
classes

[sskarz]
I
will
always
be
here
for
you

Whether
it
be
we
talk
about
random
silly
memes
or
about
how
to
deal
with
mental
struggles
.
You

re
someone
I

about

you

Thank

occasionally
I
do
make
fun
of
you

s

I

[prabipyakurel]

makes
me
think
about
how
if
I
didn
’
t
send
you
that
happy
July
4th
text
,
how
things
would
’
ve
gone
for
the
both
of
us
Tho
I
will
say
,
one
of
the
best
things
I
did
this
summer
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Not
just
the
summer
,
meeting
you
and
getting
to
know
you
more
has
been
one
of
my
highlights
of
2023
.
Right
,
actually
we
probably
would
not
have
started
taking
like
this
if
you
had
net
,
but
I
am
really
glad
you
did
.
[sskarz]
Me
as
a
person
?
As
one
of
your
highlights
?
I
’
m
gonna
need
that
framed
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
literally
you
as
a
person
.
What
can
I
say
,
you
are
just
amazing
.
[sskarz]
But
in
all
seriousness
,
thanks
for
brightening
my
days
,
it
really
warms
my
heart
when
I
get
to
talk
to
you
and
not
feel
pressured
to
be
something
that
I
don
’
t
need
to
be
.
❤
️
Nuh

’
re
way
cooler
and
more
amazingier
That
’
s
not
a
word
but
you
know
what
I
’
m
saying
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
always
,
yes
I
feel
like
I
don
’
t
need
to
be
someone
else
around
you
or
get
awkward
around
you
either
,
lol
with
me
and
my
autocorrect
and
spelling
errors
,
lol
you
are
probably
used
to
the
way
I
text
and
everything
😂
Nah
I
like
that
word
,
I
will
frame
it
.
😂
[sskarz]
Makes
me
chuckle
every
time
I
see
it
My
god
please
don
’
t
,
I
don
’
t
want
to
be
known
for
amazingier
😭
Oxford

me
rn
[prabipyakurel]
Pinned
a
message
.
[sskarz]
Oh
it
’
s
doomed
😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Imagine
tho
,
if
it
becomes
a
word
in
the
future
,
I
will
make
sure
to
post
this
post
,
that
you
came
up
with
it
first
[sskarz]
Well
it
would
turn
the
adjective
into
an
active
present
verb
..?
Idk
I
’
m
speaking
as
if
I
’
m
trying
to
answer
a
question
on
the
SAT
about
adverbs
and
adjectives
You
didn
’
t
see
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
seeing
everything
that
you
as
an
amazinger
,
person
writes
😂
[sskarz]
🤦
‍
♂
️
what
have
I
done
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
That
will
be
part
of
my
daily
vocabulary
now
Watch
me
accidentally
use
it
during
a
lecture
or
something
[sskarz]
I
pray
your
English
professor
spares
you
😭
If
you
ever
get
in
trouble
,
I
’
ll
call
in
and
take
the
blame
[prabipyakurel]
“
Professor
,
I
believe
this
character
was
far
more
amazinger
because
of
their
actions
”
😂
I
am
like
holding
in
my
laugh
rn
[sskarz]
Grammarly
finna
smack
you

[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
call
you

take
the
credit
[sskarz]
Omg

No

Oh

call
me
by
:
Sanskar
(
obviously
)
Sans
Scarface
Sand
That
’
s
ordered
from
most
common
to
least
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
gonna
create
a
new
one
for
you
[sskarz]
idk
how
Scarface
came
to
be
but
some
people
legitimately
refer
to
me
as
that
[prabipyakurel]
Give
me
a
few
days
[sskarz]
Oh
boy
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
if
that
is
meant
to
be
in
a
mean
way
or
a
funny
way
but
damn
[sskarz]
Funny
because
they
relate
it
to
the
scar
on
my
face
lol
And
they
also
can
’
t
say
sanskar
right
[prabipyakurel]
Hahahaha
[sskarz]
It
can
’
t
be
that
hard
😭
[prabipyakurel]
People
be
getting
my
name
wrong
all
the
time
and
it
’
s
so
simple
too
[sskarz]
How
do
people
mess
up
your
name
💀
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
not
,
it
’
s
literally
a
Nepali
word
that
means
good
moral
and
ethics
[sskarz]
I
live
up
to
the
name
proudly
[prabipyakurel]
Preeeebi
,
privi
,
praybe
[sskarz]
Where
does
the
e
come
from
😭
[prabipyakurel]
This
lady
at
Jamba
Juice
like
a
few
days
ago
out
my
name
as
favi
.
[sskarz]
People
gotta
be
drunk
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
what
I
am
saying
[sskarz]
LOL
WHAT
Nah
these
people
cannot
be
real
[prabipyakurel]
I
literally
pronounced
and
enunciated
the
“
p
”
As
you
should
!
Your
name
suits
you
[sskarz]
Aw
thanks
and
here
I
was
about
to
change
it
to
Dylan
Jk
jk
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ugh
no
,
stick
to
Sanskar
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
will
,
and
I
’
ve
got
a
reason
The
starbucks
on
campus
has
some
employees
that
know
me
because
I
’
ve
been
there
with
friends
many
times
And
idk
why
,
but
every
time
I
order
there
,
even
with
my
friends
,
I
’
ll
get
a
heart
drawn
on
my
cup
,
but
my
friends
wouldn
’
t
Still
trying
to
get
that
figured
out
🤔
[prabipyakurel]
Is
the
barista
a
girl
?
[sskarz]
They
rotate
baristas
like
everyday
So
everyday
it
’
s
new
,
but
I
swear
I
get
it
every
time
without
fail
No
clue
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
huh
,
maybe
they
have
like
a
favorite
customer
wall
with
your
name
on
it
[sskarz]
They
know
my
drinks
be
bussin
when
it
comes
to
Starbucks
,
I
’
ve
got
lists
of
drinks
for
certain
moods
[prabipyakurel]
Either
that
or
you
the
special
one
with
the
longest
list
of
ingredients
in
a
drink
so
they
draw
a
heart
.
[sskarz]
Similar
to
my
Spotify
playlists
lol
Hey
hey
mine
is
certainly
not
that
bad
💀
And
if
it
’
s
a
long
list
item
,
I
’
ll
order
it
online
so
I
don
’
t
have
to
stand
there
like
an
imbecile
and
telling
them
line
by
line
[prabipyakurel]
Jk
Jk
,
lol
you
are
probably
really
nice
to
them
,
it
’
s
probably
why
Imagine
,
that
person
behind
you
will
give
you
the
bombastic
side
eye
😒
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
I
’
ve
gotten
MANY
but
that
’
s
just
because
my
friends
and
I
be
goofing
around
like
total
idiots
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
lol
,
it
’
s
alright
,
just
be
you
everywhere
There
always
someone
there
to
criticize
you
,
like
always
[sskarz]
Yeah
just
drown
it
all
out
and
take
constructive
criticism
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
My
confidence
has
been
on
the
up
and
up
ever
since
Life
hack
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
’
s
so
cool
that
they
do
that
for
yours
tho
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
’
m
trying
to
find
a
picture
of
one
Hold
on
Here
’
s
one
This
was
like
early
2023
Also
I
said
Batista
like
an
idiot
[prabipyakurel]
Does
that
say
Sam
?
[sskarz]
yeah
I
say
Sam
when
I
order
[prabipyakurel]
Was
that
posted
on
insta
or
something
[sskarz]
Yup
It
was
a
story
[prabipyakurel]
😂
BASISTA
[sskarz]
I
was
going
through
my
archives
My
spelling
has
gone
down
the
drain
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Why
don
’
t
you
try
sans
[sskarz]
It
’
s
almost
always
came
out
Sand

me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
the
beginning
of
2023
,
you
are
fine
[sskarz]
I
got
3
hearts
on
this
one
I
swear
every
time
Without
fail
[prabipyakurel]
And
is
that
matcha
?
😐
like
both
of
them
[sskarz]
…
yes
Listen
Matcha
is
fire
I
will
not
back
down
from
this
statement
😤
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
’
s
fine
,
we
all
got
our
taste
.
But
damn
,
nah
those
baristas
all
got
a
crush
on
you
or
something
.
And
your
friends
that
order
with
you
,
never
get
it
?
[sskarz]
It
was
literally
just
me
they
hated
my
friends
but
liked
me
lmaoo
😂
an
ongoing
investigation
,
will
test
this
semester
[prabipyakurel]
They
saw
the
goodness
in
you
.
Hey
let
them
,
they
like
you
for
some
random
good
reason
,
take
it
!
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
the
self
esteem
going
through
the
roof
Weird
college
things
that
just
happen
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
but
that
is
definitely
something
Are
you
still
sore
from
the
gym
trip
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
literally
in
so
much
pain
As
in
,
I
cannot
move
a
muscle
I
’
m
sore
like
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
Dang
,
and
are
you
laying
down
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
laying
on
my
bed
face
down
,
and
hearing
the
howl
of
the
storm
Low
key
soothing
👍
My
muscles
however
,
screaming
And
then
my
friends
wanna
do
leg
day
tomorrow
and
im
like
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
the
face
down
things
,
I
swear
the
most
comfortable
position
[sskarz]
Is
that
how
you
sleep
regularly
?
[prabipyakurel]
The
grinding
never
stops
,
am
I
right
?
🤭
[sskarz]
I
’
m
more
of
a
baby
fetal
position
sleeper
myself
🧐
**
in
agony
**
mhmmm
yep
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
sleep
in
that
baby
fetal
position
too
,
that
is
the
way
I
sleep
,
but
when
you
need
a
nap
and
are
tired
,
the
face
down
feels
so
good
.
[sskarz]
Oh
the
face
down
with
the
nap
combo
is
unbeaten
That
’
s
like
you
restart
your
brain
type
nap
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
it
’
s
okay
to
skip
a
day
,
remember
to
give
your
body
a
break
too
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
need
my
body
to
break
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
Well
I
told
them
if
it
rains
too
hard
then
I
’
m
not
going
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
the
way
I
sleep
,
I
will
wake
up
on
the
wrong
side
,
with
no
pillows
and
like
blanket
on
the
floor
[sskarz]
Saaaaaame
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
will
probably
rain
hard
tomorrow
,
leave
it
[sskarz]
I
be
upside
down
like
my
feet
will
be
where
my
head
was
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
[sskarz]
I
move
a
lot
during
my
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
me
everyday
,
that
’
s
why
my
parents
think
I
will
fall
off
my
bed
here
😂
[sskarz]
Omg
that
would
be
the
funniest
thing
ever
ngl
[prabipyakurel]
Like
a
lot
,
I
be
having
one
of
those
heat
beating
fast
moments
because
of
the
shortest
nightmare
and
wake
up
then
drop
back
down
.
wake
up
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
happens
quite
often
with
me
as
well
I
’
ll
have
nightmares
back
to
back
But
all
short
[prabipyakurel]
Right
Damn
I
thought
that
was
only
a
me
thing
[sskarz]
Nah
I
told
u
when
I
woke
up
from
a
blackmailing
nightmare
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
like
it
happens
fast
and
then
I
wake
up
all
scared
and
when
I
fall
asleep
it
’
s
another
one
[sskarz]
Like
that
was
connected
from
other
nightmares
and
also
just
waking
up
in
between
each
one
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
Yup
exactly
like
that
I
never
have
good
dreams
💀
[prabipyakurel]
That
happens
so
much
[sskarz]
Best
I
got
is
skipping
to
the
next
morning
[prabipyakurel]
Those
sleeps
are
good
tho
,
when
you
got
nothing
to
remember
about
the
night
[sskarz]
Fr
Some
of
the
best
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
hope
that
today
you
have
happy
dreams
with
rainbows
and
unicorns
😊
[sskarz]
Haha
you
’
re
so
cute
,
thank
you
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
is
that
happy
dreams
for
you
,
idk
which
dreams
make
you
happy
[sskarz]
I
hope
it
’
s
a
good
one
too
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
aren
’
t
I
😂
😂
You
too
,
maybe
a
little
[sskarz]
Oh
the
dreams
that
make
me
happy
is
when
I
’
m
like
just
floating
around
and
I
’
m
aware
I
’
ll
take
it
😂
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Like
floating
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
Odd
I
know
But
the
feeling
of
being
nowhere
and
it
’
s
just
peaceful
Idk
,
it
just
makes
me
very
relaxed
and
happy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
sounds
peaceful
[sskarz]
Like
nothing
is
bugging
me
and
I
could
just
stay
like
that
forever
Well
till
I
wake
up
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl
yea
when
I
dream
about
just
scenery
it
is
calming
But
it
rarely
happens
[sskarz]
Yeah
unfortunately
I
hope
when
I
die
,
I
can
live
out
the
afterlife
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
aye
,
no
we
don
’
t
talk
about
death
,
we
got
years
to
live
.
And
who
knows
what
that
is
like
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
yeah
I
know
,
just
talking
philosophically
👍
I
mean
To
be
honest
I
’
d
be
happy
knowing
that
after
life
there
is
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
probably
[sskarz]
And
you
’
re
just
in
a
state
of
nothingness
Okay
you
know
what
bugs
me
Like
if
you
really
think
about
it
,
you
only
exist
because
of
how
life
is
,
no
clue
before
or
what
’
s
after
it
right
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
Like
when
we
eventually
die
,
is
it
just
back
to
nothingness
?
And
then
what
?
Weird
to
think
about
I
’
m
not
really
spiritual
or
anything
so
👍
This
is
how
I
think
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
weird
to
think
about
,
but
like
yea
it
is
a
questionable
matter
.
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
could
know
Shame
I
’
d
have
to
die
to
know
Last
thing
on
the
bucket
list
,
before
I
kick
the
bucket
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
me
get
hit
by
a
bus
tomorrow
,
dw
I
will
let
you
know
😂
Ugh
okay
,
that
’
s
one
way
to
put
it
😂
[sskarz]
My
god
prabi
don
’
t
say
that
!
Clever
wasn
’
t
it
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
ik
death
scares
me
,
but
like
imagine
,
life
is
so
fragile
[sskarz]
It
really
is
…
Okay
,
so
I
’
ve
been
thinking
about
this
for
a
while
now
And
promise
that
you
won
’
t
tell
anyone
what
I
’
m
about
to
tell
you
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
my
word
,
I
promise
.
[sskarz]
So
recently
,
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
my
dad
went
to
get
a
colonoscopy
.
And
long
story
short
,
the
doctor
said
that
a
tumor
was
about
to
grow
inside
his
body
,
and
he
’
s
lucky
to
be
alive
.
His
previous
doctor
had
actually
found
it
before
it
started
growing
and
removed
it
,
and
he
said
to
him
that
he
’
d
be
dead
in
a
year
,
which
meant
that
he
would
’
ve
died
by
now
if
it
wasn
’
t
removed
a
year
ago
.
And
it
got
me
in
a
really
…
really
depressed
state
for
a
couple
days
It
made
me
realize
how
much
my
life
would
’
ve
crumbled
to
pieces
knowing
in
a
different
reality
,
I
would
’
ve
lost
my
dad
this
year
So
I
think
partly
due
to
that
,
I
’
ve
been
pushing
myself
to
my
limits
and
doing
everything
I
can
to
better
myself
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
that
’
s
scary
to
think
about
,
and
I
am
happy
that
he
is
here
with
everyone
.
But
hey
he
is
safe
now
dw
,
and
I
pray
that
he
will
continue
to
have
the
best
health
.
Don
’
t
ever
think
about
that
too
much
,
you
are
okay
,
you
keep
doing
you
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
it
got
me
thinking
about
how
I
should
spend
my
time
We
only
have
so
much
of
it
And
life
can
change
in
an
instant
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
that
scared
me
,
and
don
’
t
worry
I
won
’
t
tell
anyone
.
Okay
so
I
am
going
to
share
something
similar
,
and
can
you
not
tell
anyone
either
.
[sskarz]
I
’
m
sorry
for
scaring
you
,
I
didn
’
t
mean
to
.
And
thank
you
,
for
keeping
it
to
yourself
👍
[prabipyakurel]
No
worries
[sskarz]
I
promise
I
won
’
t
You
have
my
word
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
so
,
your
dad
got
it
like
a
couple
weeks
ago
but
my
dad
has
his
colonoscopy
tomorrow
.
And
today
he
has
just
been
drinking
liquids
and
stuff
to
get
ready
and
I
was
literally
talking
to
them
before
texting
you
,
but
yea
I
am
hoping
that
his
test
goes
smoothly
tomorrow
and
we
get
good
results
.
[sskarz]
Your
dad
will
be
just
fine
.
I
’
ll
manifest
that
for
you
❤
️
Don
’
t
stress
!
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
!
[sskarz]
And
again
,
you
have
my
word
I
won
’
t
tell
a
soul
[prabipyakurel]
Ty
ty
,
me
neither
,
this
will
be
between
us
.
[sskarz]
For
sure
but
yeah
,
don
’
t
you
worry
It
’
s
just
a
normal
checkup
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
taking
it
as
a
normal
checkup
and
when
I
was
still
in
LA
,
I
would
be
calling
the
doctor
and
asking
them
if
it
was
serious
and
stuff
,
but
yea
I
am
praying
that
things
go
smoothly
for
him
tomorrow
.
[sskarz]
They
will
,
just
trust
that
it
will
Think
about
positive
thoughts
and
you
can
manifest
them
❤
️
I
swear
that
’
s
a
real
thing
[prabipyakurel]
I
trust
you
❤

[sskarz]
Thank
you

m

you

[prabipyakurel]
Actually

I
wish
you

been
able
to

bit
longer

Life

s
gonna
hit
somewhere
idk
I
’
m
just
spouting
nonsense
haha

s
that
time
of
the
night
where

super
philosophical
in
thought

with
where
my
life
is
going
,
and
how
I
’
m
handling
myself
with
what
I
’
m
doing
.
It
feels
like
the
most
control
I
’
ve
had
over
my
life
in
a
really
long
time
,
and
that
’
s
a
huge
thing
for
me
.
Plus
,
I
’
ve
been
able
to
talk
with
you
and
it
’
s
just
that
extra
ray
of
sunshine
that
I
needed
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Glad

,
I
hope

that
❤
️
Truly
you
’
ve
done
a
lot
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
I
appreciate
it
,
you
are
also
like
the
best
person
out
there
,
and
your
sweetness
is
all
I
need
to
make
my
day
better
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
idk
about
the
best
person
,
but
I
’
d
like
to
think
I
’
m
the
best
me
I
could
be
right
now
:)
Omg
as
I
said
that
,
thunder
struck
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
and
you
are
always
going
to
be
amazing
,
even
the
sky
speaks
.
[sskarz]
😂
Sorry
sorry
I
couldn
’
t
help
but
laugh
when
you
said
even
when
the
sky
speaks
You
are
very
charming
you
know
that
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
thanks
yes
I
try
[sskarz]
Well
you
’
re
good
at
it
hahaha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
was
laughing
when
I
wrote
that
[sskarz]
the
sky
is
probably
telling
me
to
close
my
window
before
I
get
my
room
flooded
💀
Seriously
,
it
sounds
like
a
tornado
out
here
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
sleeping
with
the
window
open
Nah
uh
close
that
thing
shut
and
lock
it
[sskarz]
The
problem
do
be
that
my
room
heats
up
real
quick
And
the
only
way
I
get
cold
air
rn
is
from
the
window
Oh
I
forgot
to
mention
[prabipyakurel]
It
won
’
t
,
it
’
s
raining
out
lol
[sskarz]
Earlier
when
we
were
talking
,
my
power
went
out
And
I
’
m
not
sure
when
that
’
s
coming
back
so
no
AC
for
now
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhhh
I
see
So
you
got
no
light
either
[sskarz]
Nope
just
the
light
from
my
phone
and
the
moon
[prabipyakurel]
We
’
ll
just
look
at
the
moon
for
light
as
of
now
[sskarz]
and
apparently
,
this
is
the
weather
after
most
of
the
hurricane
had
already
dissipated
I
can
’
t
wrap
my
head
around
that
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
heard
it
should
go
away
like
throughout
the
night
[sskarz]
Might
last
through
Monday
[prabipyakurel]
It
probably
will
[sskarz]
Speaking
of
Good
morning
;)
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
hey
,
I
didn
’
t
even
notice
,
good
morning
☀
️
Lol
time
flies
when
i
talk
to
you
,
like
often
[sskarz]
Same
here
Are
your
roommates
asleep
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
They
took
a
nap
near
the
afternoon
so
they
like
awake
awake
[sskarz]
Oof
I
get
that
[prabipyakurel]
But
they
are
in
their
beds
doing
their
thing
[sskarz]
That
’
s
the
problem
with
afternoon
naps
So
hard
to
sleep
later
[prabipyakurel]
I
try
to
avoid
them
The
naps
,
not
roommates
😂
😂
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
say
like
DAMN
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
sometimes
what
I
say
surprises
me
first
and
then
I
realize
😂
[sskarz]
Listen
to
the
sound
of
this
wind
I
swear
it
’
s
not
visually
impactful
,
and
even
the
sound
isn
’
t
accurate
It
’
s
like
howling
winds
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
it
’
s
like
stormy
stormy
out
there
And
WHY
IS
THE
WINDOW
STILL
OPEN
???
[sskarz]
I
NEED
THE
COLD
AIR
OTHERWISE
I
WILL
DIE
OF
HEAT
💀
Oh
and
my
power
came
back
[prabipyakurel]
Perfect
shut
that
thing
[sskarz]
Mmmmmmmn
maybe
I
don
’
t
wanna
get
out
of
bed
to
go
turn
on
the
AC
[prabipyakurel]
Or
if
you
have
to
leave
like
an
inch
or
2
open
Not
the
entire
thing
[sskarz]
Eh
I
’
ll
compromise
[prabipyakurel]
You
do
you
,
but
stay
safe
,
lol
it
sounds
wild
out
there
[sskarz]
It
do
be
wilding
Do
you
remember
the
last
time
that
it
hailed
in
LA
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
I
remember
I
wanted
to
go
out
[sskarz]
You
would
get
hit
by
many
tiny
ice
rocks
[prabipyakurel]
But
then
I
would
bring
the
water
in
so
I
was
denied
to
do
so
Meh
[sskarz]
Fair
enough
lol
I
’
ve
only
seen
hail
in
LA
like
3
times
in
my
entire
lifetime
And
I
thought
that
’
s
as
wild
as
weather
could
get
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
the
most
recent
one
was
kinda
crazy
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
Definitely
was
the
strongest
from
what
I
remember
of
the
other
2
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
You
aren
’
t
sleepy
yet
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
actually
kind
of
am
I
imagine
you
are
too
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

me
know
if
I
am
ever
keeping
you
awake
,

lot

Yea

kinda
am
too

[sskarz]

message

😂
[prabipyakurel]

s
a
draw
A
tie

Hey

good
afternoon
!
Hope
you
slept
well
last
night
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
good
afternoon
,
last
night
was
not
bad
,
I
woke
up
kind
of
sick
and
had
a
sore
throat
,
but
other
than
that
last
night
,
I
had
no
dream
nothing
and
woke
up
around
8
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
I
slept
like
a
rock
,
I
didn
’
t
wake
up
till
10
lol
Oh
hope
you
feel
better
soon
[prabipyakurel]
Glad
to
hear
you
slept
well
,
and
didnt
have
those
little
nighmares
that
kept
waking
you
up
.
Thank
you
,
yea
I
bought
some
cough
drops
and
have
been
using
vapo
rub
,
slowly
feeling
better
thanks
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
That
’
s
good
,
hopefully
your
sickness
goes
away
quickly
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
before
classes
start
too
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
had
no
dreams
,
but
it
was
good
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
slept
through
the
winds
?
[sskarz]
Somehow
yeah
,
it
was
howling
loud
but
I
think
I
was
just
so
tired
my
body
fully
shut
down
It
’
s
a
nice
and
bright
day
now
No
rain
in
sight
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
ita
probably
because
you
had
a
long
day
yesterday
and
we
were
talking
till
like
past
12
Yea
I
heard
that
it
is
sunny
there
now
,
great
news
,
you
can
keep
your
window
open
now
[sskarz]
Hahaha
I
got
the
AC
going
rn
I
just
came
back
from
the
gym
like
an
hour
ago
and
I
’
m
just
laying
in
my
bed
now
[prabipyakurel]
You
went
today
too
,
wow
,
you
werent
tired
or
anything
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
I
was
exhausted
,
and
I
almost
cancelled
on
my
friend
but
it
’
s
those
times
that
are
critical
to
stay
disciplined
I
pushed
so
much
weight
today
,
I
beat
a
lot
of
my
personal
records
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
your
muscles
are
probably
screaming
again
lol
.
But
yea
like
if
you
dont
feel
up
to
it
,
its
alright
to
tell
your
friends
no
,
I
am
sure
they
understand
.
[sskarz]
And
today
concludes
my
3
day
split
,
so
tomorrow
is
a
certified
rest
day
I
go
for
myself
,
no
pressure
from
them
Remember
my
motto
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
yea
"
the
grinding
never
stops
"-
Sanskar
Thapa
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
best
remember
it
The
key
to
becoming
successful
in
anything
is
consistency
and
discipline
With
those
2
things
,
over
time
any
challenge
can
be
overcome
And
any
goal
can
be
reached
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
I
will
keep
that
in
mind
,
yea
I
an
trying
to
make
a
schedule
that
includes
a
time
for
me
too
.
I
will
get
there
,
thanks
!
👍
[sskarz]
Just
gotta
do
what
you
gotta
do
so
what
’
s
your
plan
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
got
a
15
page
paper
to
read
to
prepare
for
my
classes
on
thrusday
but
like
my
head
hurts
a
lot
and
I
am
trying
my
best
to
read
and
take
notes
.
I
think
I
will
do
half
today
and
half
tomorrow
because
I
have
time
,
so
I
dont
burn
myself
out
in
the
process
.
[sskarz]
Take
it
a
step
at
a
time
,
I
agree
you
shouldn
’
t
push
yourself
when
you
’
re
having
headaches
,
it
’
ll
just
make
it
worse
[prabipyakurel]
Also
,
my
dad
'
s
report
cameout
normal
,
so
I
am
really
happy
.
Thank
you
for
giving
me
a
positive
insight
on
my
way
to
think
last
night
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
See
?
Believe
in
positive
outlook
,
and
it
’
ll
work
out
❤
️
I
preach
optimism
because
it
works
honestly
Glad
your
dad
is
doing
well
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
,
and
like
this
morning
I
attended
an
info
session
and
omg
I
was
like
sying
in
there
,
I
was
sniffling
and
it
took
me
so
long
walking
back
.
I
wanted
to
just
stop
and
drop
there
.
I
came
back
and
had
to
take
a
nap
,
because
I
just
could
not
get
mylself
to
so
anything
.
[sskarz]
Hey
taking
care
of
yourself
comes
before
anything
else
Make
sure
you
’
re
drinking
plenty
of
water
with
electrolytes
to
give
you
some
energy
too
[prabipyakurel]
Appreciate
it
,
your
words
lowered
my
stress
level
by
a
lot
last
night
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
’
m
glad
that
it
did
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
trying
,
I
heated
up
water
because
I
think
its
because
I
have
been
drinking
water
straight
out
of
the
fridge
for
a
couple
of
days
.
[sskarz]
Hmmm
yeah
could
be
Oh

schedule

professor

a
quiz
i
need
to

[prabipyakurel]
You
are
probably
the
most
prepared
,
especially
for
comp
sci
,
you
got
this
,
its
childs
play
for
you
!
😂
Is
it
easy
?
[sskarz]

up
for
me
being
clueless
💀

'
ve
got

😭
my
professor
is
letting
us
use
chat
gpt
for
essays
wtf
its
about
to
be
the
easiest
class
of
my
life
[prabipyakurel]

is
a
plus
one
tho
Give
me

min
,
I
need
to
restart
my
computer

stuff
[sskarz]
you
'
re
basically
IT
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
maybe
I
am
more
amazinger
than
you

❤
️
😂
[sskarz]

%
u

[sskarz]
nice
what
laptop
are
you
working
off
?
[prabipyakurel]
Lenovo
core
i5
,
10th
gen
[sskarz]
oh
that
'
s
pretty
good
that
probably
means
nothing
to
you
tho
💀
but
its
good
👍
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
me
so
well
[sskarz]
hahahaha
i
'
ve
helped
alot
of
people
pick
out
laptops
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
,
you
are
probably
an
expert
,
my
dad
be
walking
around
costco
looking
at
computers
and
stuff
and
the
person
there
explaining
is
like
blah
blah
blah
and
I
am
there
just
standing
all
confused
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
ok
ok
so
my
advice
don
'
t
ever
ever
listen
to
a
sales
person
talk
about
the
computers
or
laptops
they
sell
they
just
say
a
bunch
of
BS
that
sounds
good
,
but
you
will
probably
pay
more
for
a
machine
than
for
what
its
worth
if
you
ever
need
a
recommendation
on
any
tech
,

weeks

for
his
budget
range

and
he
'
s
been
incredibly
happy
with

makes
me
feel
good
when
my
friends

avoid
all
the
bs
that
costco
employees
will
tell
you

[prabipyakurel]
Nope

expect
just
good
grades
from
such
an
amazinger
person
😂
Hey
look
at
you
,
that
’
s
pretty
good
.
[sskarz]
it
was
just
an
easy
professor
back
then
thank
goodness
i
have
no
more
"
math
"
classes
tho
one
of
my
compsci
classes
is
all
theory
,
and
theory
always
means
math
:/
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
you
so
lucky
[sskarz]
you
have
one
?
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
it
’
s
comp
sci
,
you
are
fine
.
[sskarz]
i
be
telling
myself
that
too
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
got
math
16
that
comes
with
a
second
part
math
16b
,
and
then
because
I
am
an
Econ
major
one
of
the
prerequisite
is
stats
too
and
other
Econ
classes
which
mean
math
included
😭
No
fr
,
just
focus
and
you
will
get
good
grades
.
[sskarz]
i
was
like
metro
included
?
hahaha
damn
[prabipyakurel]
You
didn
’
t
see
anything
[sskarz]
honestly
i
'
ve
never
took
a
stats
class
ever
i
only
ever
took
calculus
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
got
calculus
this
year
with
no
previous
calc
knowledge
The
stress
level
about
to
go
through
the
roof
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
calculus
1
?
[prabipyakurel]
Stats
is
fun
,
I
have
done
the
coding
version
of
stats
in
data
science
but
seems
pretty
interesting
[sskarz]
or
precalc
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
calc
1
[sskarz]
omg
you
'
re
beyond
fine
omg
kms
anyway
you
will
be
fine
calculus
1
is
like
one
of
the
easiest
math
courses
of
all
time
no
lie
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
are
slowly
becoming
me
😂
[sskarz]
precalculus
was
harder
,
algebra
2
was
harder
calc
1
is
a
joke
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
because
you
are
good
at
math
?
I
love
algebra
,
it
’
s
amazing
[sskarz]
no
no
if
you
saw
my
math
,
i
would
get
the
answer
Africa
in
a
math
test
😂
calculus
is
like
,
you
get
to
skip
all
the
algebra
and
get
the
answer
by
converting
numbers
that
'
s
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
and
you
have
taken
it
before
right
?
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
taken
precalc
,
calc
1
,
calc
2
,
and
calc
3
calc
1
is
by
far
the
easiest
and
calc
3
is
the
hardest
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
alright
,
imma
be
messaging
you
if
I
got
problems
💯
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
be
able
to
help
you
in
the
beginning
,
but
my
memory
may
be
foggy
derivatives
are
pretty
easy
to
figure
out
anyways
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
alright
lol
,
I
am
not
gonna
disturb
you
,
I
was
messing
with
you
,
you
got
classes
and
stuff
too
.
I
have
been
teaching
myself
topics
Like
from
YouTube
videos
Just
to
get
a
head
start
[sskarz]
precalc
:
its
algebra
,
not
calc
calc
1
:
convert
numbers
,
easy
calc
2
:
convert
the
numbers
,
but
what
if
they
were
on
a
graph
calc
3
:
you
put
them
on
the
graph
,
but
now
the
graph
is
3D
there
'
s
the
summary
of
each
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
,
okay
maybe
I
don
’
t
need
to
freak
out
about
this
👍
Thanks
:
)
[sskarz]
hey
i
won
'
t
mind
at
all
,
send
them
my
way
and
i
'
ll
show
you
how
bad
at
math
i
am
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
lol
,
okay

[sskarz]
"

"
gare

Why

[sskarz]
i
like
to
fast
when
im
going
into
new
things
idk
how
to
explain
it
makes
me
feel
better
[prabipyakurel]
Um
yea
fasting
is
good
,
but
you
need
to
eat
to
have
energy
for
the
next
day
too
,
just
do
it
safely
.
[sskarz]
and
also
its
part
of
my
diet
for
a
couple
days
of
course
!
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
I
should
probably
start
like
some
type
of
diet
,
I
just
randomly
eat
anything
when
I
feel
like
it
.
Probably
why
I
get
sick
so
easily
lol
[sskarz]
try
to
get
most
of
your
nutrients
everyday
,
that
'
s
what
'
s
most
important
you
don
'
t
have
to
do
anything
drastic
i
do
it
because
i
want
to
look
like
chris
hemsworth

😂
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

Based

freshmen
knowledge
of
the

lol
[sskarz]
that

is
daunting
,
but

a
couple
days

[prabipyakurel]
Fr

test
I

show
you
tomorrow
when
I
do
it
,
but
when
I
type
,
I
type
really
fast
but
have
to
look
down
at
the
keyboard
Like
my
dad
used
to
teach
me
how
to
do
it
without
looking
down
,
but
I
don
’
t
know
how
to
still
[sskarz]
oooh
bet
,
typing
is
a
real
skill
in
these
times
oh
the
proper
way
?
it
takes
time
to
learn
how
to
do
it
without
looking
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
I
am
sure
yours
is
really
good
though
You
can
probably
do
the
one
without
looking
I
assume
[sskarz]
well
back
in
middle
school
,
they
put
me
in
a
compsci
class
that
made
me
learn
proper
typing
and
made
me
practice
for
2
years
straight
yeah
,
it
took
me
a
while
but
i
got
it
down
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
that
’
s
cool
.
You
have
been
doing
it
for
a
while
so
I
am
not
surprised
by
what
you
can
do
.
[sskarz]

is
my
typing
speed
rn
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
triple
digits
[sskarz]

90
max
And

[sskarz]
this

me
on

don
'
t
carry
a
notebook
no
paper
at
all
or
pencils
i
do
everything
on
an
iPad
like
digital
notes
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
right
,
you
a
comp
sci
major
[sskarz]
yeah
everything
on
the
laptop
or
iPad
makes
it
really
convenient
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
,
yea
for
me
,
I
need
to
physically
write
things
down
for
certain
subjects
[sskarz]
yeah
,
i
am
just
into
the
digital
ecosystem
[prabipyakurel]
You
don
’
t
say
[sskarz]
i
haven
'
t
used
a
pencil
and
paper
since
like
freshman
year
lol
hahahaha
sometimes
i
be
saying
redundant
things
ignore
me
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
maybe
I
will
grow
into
using
digital
note
taking
styles
too
,
who
knows
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
grown
tired
of
carrying
around
physical
papers
and
binders
takes
too
much
space
in
my
backpack
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
got
all
of
those
,
i
brought
binder
,
dividers
,
paper
,
pens
,
pencil
,
everything
[sskarz]
high
school
forced
that
stuff
on
me
,
but
i
got
sick
of
it
simply
because
im
terrible
at
organizing
lol
you
'
re
probably
good
at
it
tho
,
props
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
had
a
bad
habit
of
carrying
too
many
things
in
my
backpack
senior
year
of
high
school
too
and
people
used
to
tell
me
all
the
times
,
Nah
,
you
seems
like
a
pretty
organized
person
Thanks
,
I
try
[sskarz]
if
only
you
saw
me
in
high
school
you
would
throw
up
if
you
saw
my
backpack
then
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
right
,
the
gatsby
video
,
sorry
that
pops
up
for
me
when
I
think
about
you
and
high
school
[sskarz]
💀
you
really
did
me
like
that
hahaha
thank
goodness
that
video
doesn
'
t
exist
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
Like
is
it
gone
gone
?
[sskarz]
yeah
my
entire
catalogue
of
videos
all
gone
and
the
account
too
i
don
'
t
know
if
i
told
you
this
,
but
really
early
on
the
year
i
had
a
major
security
risk
tied
to
my
email
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
oh
yea
I
remember
you
told
me
,
sad
tho
,
we
would
have
binged
watched
those
videos
you
made
in
high
school
😂
[sskarz]
and
i
had
to
move
everything
from
that
email
to
a
new
secure
email
,
and
delete
the
old
one
in
the
process
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
no
you
did
,
I
remember
.
[sskarz]
would
'
ve
been
funny
to
watch
with
you
haha
,
i
do
regret
that
they
are
gone
they
were
good
memories
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
been
laughing
for
days
for
sure
[sskarz]
glad
you
can
enjoy
my
S
tier
acting
skills
😂
i
really
should
'
ve
been
an
actor
fr
fr
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
alright
tho
,
I
saw
one
and
that
is
good
enough
to
tell
me
how
great
of
an
actor
you
were
Actually
tho
,
imagine
[sskarz]
oh
hell
no
i
would
just
improvise
all
my
lines
all
the
time
,
and
it
'
d
be
terrible
i
do
not
have
the
ryan
reynolds
in
me
[prabipyakurel]
Hahaha
well
it
’
s
never
too
late
[sskarz]
oh
no
its
long
gone
dw
you
will
not
have
to
see
my
face
in
any
theatrical
performance
😂
😂
so
is
everything
associated
with
creativity
im
really
not
good
at
that
stuff
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
are
not
alone
,
I
always
make
it
awkward
recording
anything
or
talking
in
front
of
a
group
[sskarz]
oh
no
but
that
one
video
you
showed
me
of
your
project
,
that
was
golden
😂
immaculate
acting
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
nah
,
that
was
fun
tho
I
will
tell
you
that
,
but
my
acting
,
nah
,
my
teacher
called
me
a
grandma
and
I
was
supposed
to
be
a
president
💀
[sskarz]
close
....
enough
😂
basically
the
same
if
you
really
think
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Meh
[sskarz]
i
think
we
both
have
very
analytical
brains
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
so
[sskarz]
like
numbers
and
stuff
i
just
say
that
because
there
is
nothing
for
me
on
the
opposite
spectrum
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
nooo
Don
’
t
say
that
[sskarz]
no
no
trust
me
if
you
saw
my
art
when
i
was
a
kid
it
was
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
I
still
draw
bad
,
as
an
18
year
old
[sskarz]
the
teacher
gave
me
a
good
grade
out
of
pity
of
me
trying
💀
infinitely
better
than
me
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
lol
that
’
s
so
adorable
,
what
did
you
draw
that
was
that
bad
?
[sskarz]
it
was
an
art
class
back
in
high
school
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
I
am
sure
you
draw
better
trust
me
,
I
get
excited
when
I
can
draw
anything
better
than
a
stick
figure
[sskarz]
and
i
used
to
stay
in
that
class
through
lunch
time
and
work
on
drawing
skills
really
hard
with
the
teacher
giving
me
tips
and
stuff
and
i
guess
they
recognized
the
effort
i
put
in
and
still
gave
me
a
decent
grading
just
from
proof
of
me
trying
never
again
will
i
take
an
arts
class
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
,
you
spent
time
and
tried
,
you
should
get
decent
grades
.
That
is
set
in
stone
for
me
Also
my
art
requirement
was
fulfilled
for
college
so
I
’
m
good
hehe
[sskarz]
oh
if
you
saw
the
other
student
'
s
drawings
,
they
be
the
reincarnation
of
leonardo
da
vinci
fr
oh
nice
!!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
totally
,
some
kids
be
drawing
real
good
out
there
,
I
just
need
to
look
at
my
brothers
drawing
to
see
how
how
bad
I
draw
😂
[sskarz]
your
brother
is
honestly
amazing
at
drawing
im
always
at
awe
when
i
see
his
drawings
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
he
like
draws
everything
with
perfection
Miss
that
kid
[sskarz]
you
guys
squash
that
beef
from
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
that
was
settled
[sskarz]
okay
that
'
s
good
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
because
it
was
the
day
before
my
dad
had
his
procedure
and
I
was
mad
that
he
wouldn
’
t
not
pick
up
when
I
need
him
to
I
fr
told
him
and
he
answers
my
phone
now
We
good
.
👍
[sskarz]
that
'
s
great
to
hear
im
ngl
i
rarely
see
my
sister
these
days
she
'
s
got
a
busy
work
schedule
,
12
hour
shifts
and
sometimes
days
go
by
and
i
don
'
t
see
or
hear
from
her
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
it
can
be
hard
sometimes
and
I
don
’
t
know
how
it
feels
,
but
sometimes
it
’
s
okay
,
she
is
trying
her
best
and
I
am
sure
she
wants
to
be
around
you
too
,
but
give
it
time
,
it
’
s
alright
.
[sskarz]
yeah
dw
im
good
lol
just
something
i
thought
about
rn
[prabipyakurel]
She
is
a
nurse
,
and
they
are
extremely
busy
so
I
understand
why
she
would
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
she
'
s
on
the
grind
too
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
she
is
probably
busy
all
the
time
[sskarz]
yeah
you
getting
sleepy
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
you
?
[sskarz]
not
at
all
i
'
ve
got
music
blasting
my
ears
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
like
trying
to
shut
my
eyes
and
they
won
’
t
shut
[sskarz]
the
nap
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
doing
that
with
a
bunch
of
Hindi
songs
a
few
hours
ago
in
the
dorm
Like
no
headphones
nothing
,
I
am
sure
the
Indian
people
down
the
hall
could
hear
it
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
they
should
'
ve
come
and
joined
in
the
vibe
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
they
be
like
playing
their
music
so
Loud
on
speaker
so
I
did
it
too
[sskarz]
ah
you
'
re
trying
to
tell
them
to
lower
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
they
all
boys
,
and
it
’
s
kinda
funny
because
at
school
we
aren
’
t
used
to
gender
neutral
restrooms
but
here
,
I
will
be
brushing
and
I
will
walk
into
them
having
a
full
on
conversation
doing
their
skincare
in
there
No
,
song
choices
are
pretty
good
so
they
are
fine
[sskarz]
ah
that
'
s
good
oh
that
is
definitely
interesting
lol
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
just
do
that
awkward
hey
and
say
bye
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
,
i
'
ve
never
seen
a
gender
neutral
bathroom
is
it
common
over
there
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
in
the
dorms
yea
There
is
a
floor
only
for
girls
,
but
like
boys
can
go
in
there
,
no
restrictions
But
it
’
s
common
,
it
’
s
a
communal
restroom
so
like
anyone
can
be
in
there
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
interesting
probably
a
bay
area
thing
[prabipyakurel]
No
i
am
sure
the
dorms
at
other
schools
have
that
too
.
[sskarz]
yeah
probably
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
definitely
gets
weird
sometimes
Oh
and
they
spray
on
that
cologne
and
it
smells
like
boys
in
there
😂
[sskarz]
the
classic
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
tell
when
you
get
near
[sskarz]
the
boys
restrooms
at
my
school
are
the
same
some
people
be
putting
so
much
it
makes
my
eyes
water
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
and
some
boys
are
like
that
,
seriously
one
spray
is
enough
[sskarz]
fr
i
go
for
3
max
like
any
more
than
that
and
its
just
bad
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
3
is
fine
I
think
,
but
like
some
of
them
are
like
spraying
the
entire
bottle
for
the
day
[sskarz]
the
smell
is
so
pungent
sometimes
like
my
eyes
really
start
to
sweat
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[sskarz]
and
its
always
Axe
like
always
[prabipyakurel]
Heard
of
that
one
,
it
is
really
strong
apparently
Oooo
we
might
me
checking
out
the
gym
tomorrow
[sskarz]
ooooooooh
send
me
pics
i
would
love
to
see
what
it
looks
like
inside
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
send
one
of
me
using
the
equipment
the
wrong
way
too
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
the
one
where
it
makes
me
physically
uncomfortable
haha
bet
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
me
go
in
there
and
do
something
I
am
not
supposed
to
Imma
get
yelled
at
[sskarz]
nah

'
ll
be
fine
its
really
hard
to
screw
up
an
exercise
in
the
gym
unless
you
'
re
focused
on
trying
to
screw
it
up
especially
on
the
machines
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

I
will
read

and
use
them
[sskarz]

Thank

[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhhh
my
my
do
i
have
stories
😂
i
have
my
fair
share
of
people
that
despise
me
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
’
t
think
of
a
reason
anyone
would
really
not
like
you
.
[sskarz]
other
people
certainly
find
ways
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
listen
to
them
,
there
will
always
be
someone
there
making
you
look
bad
and
saying
things
,
tell
me
I
will
beat
them
up
for
you
,
if
they
aren
’
t
too
tall
.
😂
[sskarz]
ironically
the
people
that
despise
me
the
most
are
very
short
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Who
hates
you
that
much
and
why
?
Perfect
They
my
level
[sskarz]
honestly
,
for
the
majority
of
them
,
i
'
ve
got
no
clue
but
they
always
treated
me
like
shit
so
there
'
s
some
reason
idk
about
[prabipyakurel]
Ignore
them
,
you
are
perfect
as
you
are
.
Don
’
t
need
to
listen
to
no
one
.
People
always
got
something
.
[sskarz]
oh
trust
me
,
i
'
m
not
changing
for
no
one
haha
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
more
like
it
.
[sskarz]
they
will
always
find
a
way
don
'
t
they
but
im
not
perfect
,
some
people
don
'
t
like
me
and
i
know
why
and
they
are
valid
,
but
they
were
from
when
i
was
in
middleschool
and
i
won
'
t
lie
,
i
was
a
whole
different
person
back
then
[prabipyakurel]
Who
cares
about
middle
school
,
you
are
perfect
from
where
I
am
standing
so
you
good
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
god
you
are
such
a
charmer
,
seriously
you
'
re
good
at
it
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
we
all
have
our
younger
selves
,
we
all
needed
improvements
and
growth
,
don
’
t
compare
yourself
to
when
you
were
in
middle
school
,
you
are
far
better
now
.
Taller
too
,
something
god
gave
up
on
when
it
was
my
turn
😭
😂
Aww
ty
,
but
it
’
s
the
truth
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
hey
hey
you
'
ve
got
tons
of
advantages
to
being
short
too
like
airplane
seats
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
ok
,
you
people
die
first
if
the
sky
falls
[sskarz]
fr
tho
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
for
sure
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
tell
you
how
many
times
i
'
ve
been
on
an
airplane
and
im
like
super
scrunched
up
with
my
knees
hitting
the
seat
in
front
of
me
[prabipyakurel]
They
be
giving
you
that
bombastic
side
eye
😂
😂
[sskarz]
omg
i
remember
this
one
time
someone
got
pissed
at
me
because
when
i
was
sleeping
,
i
kept
moving
and
so
my
knees
would
keep
moving
their
seat
and
they
even
confronted
me
about
it
,
and
im
like
idk
what
to
tell
you
there
'
s
nothing
i
can
do
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Lmao
,
that
would
have
been
so
funny
to
witness
Karma
for
being
to
tall
[sskarz]
oh
it
was
so
not
funny
for
the
other
fellow
i
had
no
say
in
the
matter
💀
[prabipyakurel]
You
fr
gonna
look
like
a
giant
if
you
stand
in
front
of
me
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
definitely
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Probably
a
Karen
[sskarz]
probably
,
it
was
a
white
woman
so
like
close
enough
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
yea
But
yea
when
I
went
on
the
trip
to
Nepal
,
I
sat
cross
cross
on
the
plane
seat
and
was
fine
.
[sskarz]
living
the
dream
😭
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
like
the
perfect
person
to
throw
across
the
room
when
you
mad
.
💀
Like
tiny
tiny
[sskarz]
why
does
this
sound
like
its
coming
from
experience
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Um
[sskarz]
have
you
ever
been
tossed
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
My
cousin
did
that
when
I
was
little
,
no
not
right
now
but
when
I
was
little
yea
Not
yet
at
least
Imma
say
the
wrong
thing
to
someone
one
day
and
I
will
get
thrown
[sskarz]
omg
💀
you
will
not
get
thrown
trust
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
sometimes
what
comes
out
of
my
mouth
surprises
me
too
😂
[sskarz]
who
in
their
right
mind
is
going
to
throw
you
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
,
someone
I
will
piss
off
lol
[sskarz]
you
?
pissing
someone
off
?
can
'
t
see
it
happening
how
can
the
nicest
person
on
planet
earth
be
pissing
someone
off
❤
️
the
math
don
'
t
add
up
😂
[prabipyakurel]
In
middle
school
I
was
walking
randomly
and
this
girl
that
I
knew
was
like
guys
I
smell
like
a
tortilla
and
I
thought
it
would
be
funny
to
tell
a
Mexican
girl
“
yea
you
look
like
one
too
”
the
Death
Stare
she
gave
me
.
💀
[sskarz]
SAVAGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
that
'
s
funny
asf
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ty
ty
,
but
if
someone
messes
with
me
,
I
will
say
the
meanest
things
to
them
[sskarz]
honestly
i
respect
it
oh
valid
,
trash
talk
them
[prabipyakurel]
Especially
if
that
person
is
my
friends
ex
I
will
destroy
the
dude
Lol
but
she
was
so
nice
,
it
just
came
out
I
laughed
at
myself
[sskarz]
you
let
me
know
if
he
pokes
his
head
into
your
life
,
i
got
the
punches
and
i
won
'
t
pull
any
of
them
truly
a
garbage
human
being
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
[sskarz]
there
are
certain
people
that
deserve
like
nothing
nah
but
the
way
i
'
d
be
laughing
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Your
legendary
conversation
began
with
the
nice
version
of
me
,
you
should
see
the
mean
side
I
was
laughing
all
the
way
to
the
breakfast
line
For
sure
[sskarz]
let
me
know
when
the
show
starts
and
i
'
ll
be
ready
to
see
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
got
nothing
against
you
,
I
won
’
t
ever
find
a
reason
to
be
mad
at
you
.
You
don
’
t
have
to
worry
:
)
[sskarz]
idk
what
'
s
wrong
with
me
,
but
you
keep
saying
nice
things
and
its
like
just
be
mean
for
once
😭
like
i
swear
that
'
s
just
not
normal
,
something
is
not
right
subconsciously
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
not
see
me
teasing
you
about
everything
you
have
said
so
far
?
You
too
lost
to
see
that
[sskarz]
im
too
lost
in
the
sauce
i
told
u
im
clueless
you
were
probably
messing
with
me
and
i
probably
took
you
seriously
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
really
no
reason
for
me
to
be
mean
to
you
that
’
s
why
,
you
are
so
nice
that
’
s
why
,
why
are
you
so
nice
?
[sskarz]
i
get
it
from
my
mom
blame
her
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
lol
but
yea
I
would
never
lash
out
at
you
,
you
are
understanding
and
kind
,
and
I
won
’
t
blame
your
mom
,
that
’
s
a
good
character
trait
you
have
.
And
who
in
the
world
hurt
you
that
bad
,
you
deserve
to
be
preached
and
told
nice
things
,
idk
what
you
mean
.
[sskarz]
idk
what
it
is
,
sometimes
i
be
talking
a
little
too
honestly
haha
but
i
guess
that
'
s
a
good
thing
,
i
don
'
t
feel
pressured
when
i
talk
about
stuff
like
this
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
shouldn
’
t
,
you
can
share
anything
,
whether
you
want
me
to
give
advice
or
just
nod
and
you
keep
talking
lol
I
am
here
.
[sskarz]
thank
you

i
'
d
be
willing
to
listen
to
anything

❤
️

'
t
need
to
keep
saying
it
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

not
stop
disturbing
you
,
or

[prabipyakurel]

❤
️
[sskarz]

little
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Same
here
,
I
am
glad
god
put
you
in
my
life
,
you
know
good
things
be
happening
this
year
.
Right
a
little
😂
😂
[sskarz]
but
fr
tho
im
just
glad
that
i
can
share
stuff
with
someone
and
have
someone
to
talk
to
everyday
and
its
not
stressful
or
pressuring
or
anything
like
that
❤
️
i
won
'
t
lie
,
its
not
as
bad
as
before
,
but
i
used
to
feel
obligated
to
talk
to
some
people
and
having
to
talk
about
things
i
wasn
'
t
comfortable
with
but
i
swear
,
i
have
nothing
like
that
when
i
talk
with
you
its
just
refreshing
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
for
some
people
it
is
like
that
,
because
you
feel
like
you
have
to
reach
out
since
they
did
but
don
’
t
know
how
to
keep
the
conversation
going
.
I
have
been
in
those
situations
lol
.
👍
It
’
s
just
pure
happiness
when
I
talk
you
no
,
literally
the
best
feeling
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
hope
I
can
provide
the
same
feeling
going
forward
:)
[prabipyakurel]
You
certainly
will
.
[sskarz]
okay
you
know
what
i
was
just
about
to
say
i
was
about
to
say
we
'
ve
gotten
so
good
at
not
having
to
say
"
you
first
"
😂
when
we
both
type
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
yes
But
you
first
You
were
typing
[sskarz]
oh
no
no
that
'
s
catually
what
i
wanted
to
say
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
here
we
go
again
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Catually
🐱
😂
Beautiful
Well
I
just
wanted
to
say
I
remember
when
I
first
sent
you
that
discord
friend
request
,
I
was
like
he
probably
won
’
t
like
me
or
walk
to
me
normally
and
find
me
weird
but
the
more
we
talk
the
more
it
makes
me
realize
how
great
of
a
person
you
are
.
I
fr
thought
that
you
already
found
me
so
weird
when
we
met
at
bijesh
house
that
one
time
[sskarz]
oh
please
,
i
was
excited
to
see
that
you
friended
me
,
I
wasn
'
t
sure
if
you
actually
wanted
to
talk
or
not
no
no
I
'
m
just
awkward
,
trust
me
haha
I
was
also
not
anticipating
that
you
were
going
to
be
there
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
glad
I
did
[sskarz]
like
you
just
completely
surprised
me
in
a
good
way
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Me
neither
lol
,
you
were
just
there
and
I
was
like
huh
Usually
don
’
t
see
you
in
many
places
that
’
s
why
You
are
not
[sskarz]
true
,
nowadays
if
I
get
invited
to
an
event
,
and
I
don
'
t
know
who
or
what
'
s
it
about
and
my
familiarity
of
who
are
coming
to
said
event
,
I
won
'
t
go
but
hey
,
if
I
hear
you
'
re
going
then
I
will
go
too
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
’
s
too
many
people
[sskarz]
then
at
least
I
'
ve
got
someone
to
talk
to
being
there
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
it
’
s
nice
to
have
someone
to
talk
to
We
can
judge
people
together
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
my
favorite
haha
tbh
everytime
im
at
a
nepali
party
,
99
%
of
the
time
im
there
for
the
food
[prabipyakurel]
Always
nothing
else
to
do
there
[sskarz]
i
could
care
less
about
the
event
unless
its
about
someone
close
to
me
or
that
I
know
about
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
same
here
[sskarz]
idk
it
sounds
messed
up
but
at
this
point
,
I
'
ve
been
to
so
many
when
I
was
younger
and
I
'
m
tired
of
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
too
many
,
we
be
going
to
one
like
every
other
week
[sskarz]
no
like
fr
,
before
covid
,
it
was
one
every
week
or
more
than
that
per
week
[prabipyakurel]
Rightttt
[sskarz]
and
also
,
this
is
gonna
sound
bad
but
some
of
the
venues
that
closed
down
were
the
ones
that
were
super
popular
,
but
also
had
terrible
food
and
i
absolutely
hated
going
there
[prabipyakurel]
Aha
lol
yep
some
were
like
that
[sskarz]
its
like
an
event
and
i
'
ve
got
no
friends
,
and
plus
the
food
was
terrible
i
would
actually
be
on
my
phone
the
entire
time
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
would
do
that
too
And
these
random
group
of
people
would
come
at
around
me
and
I
would
do
that
awkward
namaste
and
continue
staring
down
😂
[sskarz]
SAME
LOL
and
then
some
aunty
would
come
up
and
be
like
:
do
you
remember
me
when
you
were
like
-
1
years
old
I
held
you
and

Omg

feeling
[sskarz]
Like

😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
swear
I
would
not
know
anyone
tho
[sskarz]
frrr
But
I
can
’
t
say
that
so
I
just
pretend
like
oh
yeah
I
remember
totally
Back
when
I
was
like
in
the
belly
still
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
in
the
belly
[sskarz]
Like
what
’
s
your
youngest
memory
?
how
young
were
you
and
you
remember
something
being
that
age
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
running
down
in
my
house
in
the
village
and
dropping
a
gallon
of
water
and
started
crying
like
it
’
s
wasn
’
t
jut
me
that
did
that
😂
[sskarz]
*
ok
technically
it
’
s
your
oldest
memory
but
you
know
what
I
mean
*
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
4
or
5
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Same
,
I
had
a
memory
of
being
in
pre
school
and
stealing
some
kids
toys
And
I
got
in
trouble
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[sskarz]
And
I
thought
I
did
nothing
wrong
😂
Still
vivid
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
like
he
was
sharing
[sskarz]
Nah
I
just
didn
’
t
bring
toys
to
the
play
dates
so
I
would
be
sitting
there
,
playing
with
other
peoples
toys
Or
just
outright
taking
it
from
them
I
was
a
menace
as
a
baby
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
me
too
,
I
was
chubby
and
fat
and
made
so
many
mistakes
You
got
baby
pics
?
[sskarz]
Too
many
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
I
wanna
seee
one
[sskarz]
My
dad
keeps
wanting
to
show
me
them
and
I
just
gag
looking
at
young
me
Idk
I
’
m
not
fond
of
my
young
pics
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
a
baby
,
you
had
no
style
it
’
s
fine
[sskarz]
Haha
I
cried
a
lot
as
a
baby
so
most
of
them
were
just
me
crying
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
got
any
on
you
?
[sskarz]
Nah
not
on
me
,
but
if
I
come
across
them
in
the
future
I
’
ll
share
them
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
okay
yea
share
them
so
I
can
laugh
at
them
😂
Also
the
baby
fever
is
gonna
be
so
high
[sskarz]
For
sure
lol
Oh
did
I
tell
you
I
don
’
t
get
that
like
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

me
Idk
how
[sskarz]
me
neither
[prabipyakurel]
Babies
are
like
so
small
and
you
just
wanna
be
a
baby
with
them
[sskarz]
But
I
get
doggo
fever
Me

I
’
ll
baby
talk
him
all
day
but
I
don
’
t
get
that
feeling
with
babies
[prabipyakurel]
“
you
like
bees
bear
”
he
starts
eating
them
the
next
day
💀
[sskarz]
He
probably
ate
more
of
them
today
[prabipyakurel]
You
just
got
to
meet
the
right
baby
[sskarz]
Well
maybe
,
but
I
’
ve
dealt
with
a
lot
so
idkkk
everyone
else
has
it
and
then
it
’
s
just
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
just
different
lol
Totally
normal
[sskarz]
Like
when
my
baby
cousin
comes
over
,
everyone
is
fighting
over
her
and
I
’
m
just
sitting
there
like
yeah
she
’
s

[prabipyakurel]
I
would
too
,
I
would
carry
a
baby
everywhere
Baby
them
all
I
want
I
will
sleep
on
the
floor
with
them
and
just
watch
them
smile
[sskarz]
Awwwww

’
s
adorable
I
can
tell
you
’
d

a
great
babysitter

[prabipyakurel]

over
you

house
that
time
and
I
think
your
little
cousin

there
,
she
was
so
adorable
I
just
wanted
to
pick
her
up
and
spin
her
around
I
my
arms
😂
Maybe
,
but
I
am
always
scared
I
will
drop
them
or
something
by
accident
[sskarz]
You
just
got
that
connection
Nah

d

It

👋
hey
hey
,
just
finished
all
my
work
and
class
how
'
s
your
day
been
going
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
,
my
day
went
by
smooth
,
woke
up
and
took
a
shower
and
felt
so
much
better
.
Attended
an
info
session
for
upcoming
Econ
majors
and
went
to
check
out
where
my
math
class
is
taking
place
.
I
also
checked
out
the
recreation
facility
and
it
was
so
big
.
How
about
you
?
Doesn
’
t
your
class
go
up
to
4
or
3
:
45
on
tuesdays
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
from
2
to
4
But
I
finished
all
the
work
early
so
I
left
Oooh
did
you
get
to
take
pics
of
the
recreation
facility
?
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
interesting
,
didnt
know
it
worked
like
that
.
I
took
one
lol
,
there
were
so
many
BOYSSSSS
I
literally
walked
in
,
looked
around
and
left
lol
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
,
many
professors
will
allow
you
to
just
leave
if
you
finished
the
lecture
and
the
work
associated
with
it
So
for
me
,
lecture
was
2
to
3
then
3
to
4
is
the
workshop
I
finished
in
20
mins
and
left
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
damn
,
the
more
you
know
.
I
fr
thought
you
had
to
stay
till
class
ended
[sskarz]
Had
to
be
that
guy
that
rushes
the
work
during
lecture
,
and
leaves
early
during
workshop
😂
Hey
idk
how
it
works
with
you
guys
and
your
major
,
but
for
me
at
least
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
,
you
that
one
kid
that
is
like
,
i
dont
care
professor
,
imma
do
my
thing
.
[sskarz]
Plus
I
know
most
of
the
professors
and
they
know
me
,
so
they
don
’
t
really
care
Yeah
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Well
thats
good
tho
,
you
can
just
do
work
and
leave
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
makes
my
life
easy
[prabipyakurel]
So
it
’
s
like
this
from
the
entrance
and
it
curves
to
the
left
and
I
am
sure
there
is
an
upstairs
too
[sskarz]
Woah
there
’
s
like
personal
stalls
for
working
out
???
That
’
s
so
coooooool
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
[sskarz]
Man
I
gotta
switch
colleges
😂
that
’
s
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
late
,
you
got
a
few
years
,
go
for
it
it
will
be
quite
an
experience
[sskarz]
Ooooh
idk
,
we
’
ll
see
about
that
maybe
if
I
go
for
my
business
master
too
[prabipyakurel]
Go
for
it
so
...
did
you
skip
gym
or
you
went
today
too
?
[sskarz]
Oh
no
today
is
a
certified
rest
day
[prabipyakurel]
test
or
rest
[sskarz]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
saw
that
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
But
no
gym
today
Gotta
let
myself
heal
for
tomorrow
Rest
days
are
very
important
yk
,
people
that
go
everyday
of
the
week
compared
to
6
days
a
week
and
a
rest
day
,
the
latter
will
do
better
in
performance
and
muscle
gains
Fatigue
builds
up
fast
and
impacts
you
easily
in
future
workouts
if
you
don
’
t
take
rest
days
[prabipyakurel]
*
rest
days
[sskarz]
My
god
Apple
doesn
’
t
want
me
to
say
rest
😭
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
,
always
remember
to
give
yourself
time
too
.
that
autocorrect
😂
[sskarz]
It
’
s
killing
me
lol
I
’
m
getting
lunch
rn
,
gotta
round
out
the
day
Wbu
?
Whatchu
doing
[prabipyakurel]
well
I
am
just
reading
my
sociology
article
before
the
first
classas
of
now
,
but
i
got
a
chicken
wrap
for
lunch
in
the
fridge
and
just
gonna
wait
till
dinner
opens
after
that
.
[sskarz]
Oh
okay
,
prepping
for
your
classes
tomorrow
right
[prabipyakurel]
Where

going
?
or
are
you
maing
lunch
?
[sskarz]
Just
went
down
to
the
food
court
and
got
myself
a
chicken
avocado
burrito
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
honeslty
I
am
freaking
out
,
I
only
got
math
on
Mondays
,
Wednesdays
,
and
Fridays
,
and
its
scary
[sskarz]
Well
at
least
the
first
day
is
mostly
going
to
be
syllabus
related
so
you
can
get
adjusted
Don
’
t
freak
out
,
you
’
re
going
to
do
just
fine
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
good
!
👍
Hopefully
,
but
its
a
indian
professor
,
dude
is
probably
going
to
be
like
"
good
morning
,
shall
we
start
with
the
first
problem
"
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
nah
syllabus
always
comes
first
…
usually
Or
they
might
do
review
worst
case
they
won
’
t
just
jump
straight
into
it
thinking
you
know
all
the
derivatives
and
anti
derivatives
and
what
not
So
trust
me
,
you
’
ll
do
fine
.
Plus
I
bet
you
catch
on
easily
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
maybe
,
it
makes
sense
to
start
with
the
syllabus
.
[sskarz]
Mhmm
[prabipyakurel]
This
is
college
,
I
dont
know
anything
lol
[sskarz]
Take
it
from
someone

expect
from
the
dude

wrap
[prabipyakurel]
it
is
[sskarz]
Does
it
smell
bad
?
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
If

😭
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

them
in
my
head
.
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
No

sometimes
you
are
like
literally
the
best
person
to
get
advice
from
.
I
dont
have
a
physical
list
btw
[sskarz]
no
no
i
gotchu
lol
i
'
ve
got
my
own
list
in
my
head
too
of
the
things
you
'
ve
helped
me
with
❤
️
so
yk
,
it
works
out
haha
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
say
the
most
random
things
sometimes
You
know
this
one
time
I
set
my
friends
up
and
the
just
stopped
talking
to
each
other
for
the
next
week
[sskarz]
hahaha
no
no
you
'
re
good
,
im
not
judging
at
all
or
anything
oh
?
what
happened
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
they
liked
each
other
and
it
was
pretty
obvious
in
the
group
chat
,
but
then
i
think
after
they
confronted
each
other
(
me
and
my
other
friend
tony
were
in
a
table
with
them
)
it
got
weird
and
I
talk
to
both
and
they
were
both
sharing
what
happened
in
those
conversation
,
Clearly
somthing
didnt
go
right
,
so
I
decided
to
be
a
little
therapist
and
help
,
but
they
didnt
wanna
do
anything
to
fix
it
,
now
if
they
are
just
friends
I
was
sitting
on
the
fence
taking
on
both
sides
and
then
it
just
randomly
ended
somehow
[sskarz]
oh
that
is
very
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
one
of
the
interesting
ones
for
sure
and
I
talk
to
both
and
they
talk
in
group
chat
so
we
good
[sskarz]
well
even
if
someone
likes
someone
,
no
guarantee
that
they
will
like
being
around
them
closer
sometimes
it
just
doesn
'
t
work
out
but
hey
,
glad
they
'
re
still
friends
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
learned
stuff
from
them
,
yea
i
am
so
glad
they
are
still
friends
Thats
true
tho
[sskarz]
yeah
i
'
ve
seen
that
happen
a
couple
of
times
with
some
of
my
friends
similar
story
,
one
of
my
own
friends
got
setup
with
a
friend
of
a
friend
,
and
they
talked
for
like
3
weeks
and
then
just
stopped
idk
what
happened
but
they
just
called
it
there
and
like
,
fair
enough
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
mean
you
got
to
wait
till
you
find
the
one
sometimes
But
like
I
am
the
last
person
to
be
giving
any
sort
of
relationship
advice
,
yet
I
will
still
be
like
,
nah
dont
like
him
,
get
rid
of
him
😂
[sskarz]
i
mean
objectively
,
those
that
aren
'
t
in
relationships
can
see
things
in
a
clearer
light
no
rose
tinted
glasses
yk
[prabipyakurel]
huh
maybe
,
never
thought
of
it
that
way
[sskarz]
yeah
its
a
different
perspective
so
there
are
benefits
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
not
wrong
there
,
i
dont
know
,
never
really
gave
these
things
a
thought
,
i
just
watched
all
of
my
friends
go
through
stuff
randomly
and
just
took
note
[sskarz]
have
you
been
in
a
relationship
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
Never
dated
nothing
[sskarz]
ah
i
gotcha
nothing
wrong
with
that
btw
,
idk
why
but
people
feel
pressured
about
that
sorta
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
I
am
proud
to
be
single
,
gotta
wait
and
find
the
right
one
for
like
[sskarz]

'
ve
had
multiple
friends
complain
about
not
having
a
girlfriend
/
boyfriend

you
don
'
t
need
one
then
you
'
re

little
[sskarz]
no

like

boulder

get
much
denser
than
a
mountain
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
dont
hang
up
anything
from
our
conversation
,
lol
I
have
a
good
reputation
in
front
of
nepali
people
and
someone
is
gonna
be
like

is
mean
and
rude
[sskarz]

image
of
you

list
for
that

[prabipyakurel]
No

I
have
this
one
friend
from
hs
(
the
one
i
messaged
about
having
20
kids
)
and
like
everyday
in
english
,
i
needed
a
hug
from
her
to
start
the
day
,
And
she
would
give
the
warmest
hugs
.
I
would
give
her
the
death
stare
if
she
walked
away
and
forgot
to
do
it
.
Goes
to
slo
now
,
she
got
the
audacity
to
stay
so
far
away
from
me
fr
😤
😂
[sskarz]
she
had
to
keep
the
hugs
,
they
'
re
limited
edition
haha
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
,
and
I
love
hugging
people
,
I
am
tiny
so
like
when
anyine
gives
me
hug
,
the
other
person
is
like
a
big
teddy
bear
idk
thats
just
how
i
see
it
lol
[sskarz]
dw
i
'
ll
put
on
a
teddy
bear
suit
on
when
we
meet
😂
👍
then
it
'
ll
really
be
a
big
teddy
bear
hug
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
would
be
so
adorable
,
I
will
literally
make
you
run
until
you
do
a
little
fall
❤
️
and
then
laugh
I

are
so
much
taller
,

like
that
anyway
but

[sskarz]
i
'
ll
keep
it
in
mind
,

promises

[prabipyakurel]

you
waiting
for
me
in
a
teddy
bear
costume
and
someone
sees
you
,
its
gonna
be
so
awkward
😂
[sskarz]
as
long
as
its
not
a
family
member
or
someone
nepali
that
knows
me
,
i
'
m
totally
fine
with
it
haha
[prabipyakurel]

mean
who
wouldn
'
t
want
to
be
in
a
teddy
bear
suit
that
'
s
fr
me
[prabipyakurel]
But
fr
,
you
can
pull
that
off
They
wont
know
you
,
they
will
think
you
are
participating
in
a
birthday
party
for
a
little
kid
[sskarz]
me
outside
your
house
jk
jk
lmfao
[prabipyakurel]
nah
fr
,
everyone
inside
will
be
staring
at
you
like
you
waiting
to
rob
the
house
.
💀
[sskarz]
can
'
t
wait
to
be
on
the
local
news
:
man
in
teddy
bear
costume
arrested
because
family
thought
they
were
being
robbed
😭
[prabipyakurel]
omg
imagine
[sskarz]
that
would
be
a
funny
headline
tho
😂
so
whatchu
doing
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
am
about
to
head
out
for
dinner
,
the
menu
looks
pretty
indian
today
.
[sskarz]
omg
if
they
got
chicken
tikka
masala
,
that
would
be
so
cool
hey
hope
you
have
a
good
dinner
!

'
ll
talk
afterwards
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
a
good
dinner
too
,
we
will
talk
after
,
I
still
need
to
make
fun
of
you
.
😂
❤
️
Not
bad
for
today
[sskarz]
yeah
that
looks
good
what
'
s
your
rating
?
[prabipyakurel]
Just
tried
the
samosa
and
it
is
8
/
10
The
rest
,
we
gonna
find
out
after
[sskarz]
oh
samosas
are
bomb
you
can
'
t
go
wrong
with
them
[prabipyakurel]
You
really
can
’
t
,
who
would
have
thought
they
would
give
us
samosas
Better
than
lunch
for
sure
[sskarz]
is
this
all
included
too
or
did
you
have
to
pay
for
this
[prabipyakurel]
All
included
So
like
I
have
12
swipes
a
week
and
some
days
I
eat
out
and
stuff
so
I
will
have
enough
for
the
week
[sskarz]
ohhh
i
see
that
'
s
good
how
'
s
the
other
food
tasting
like
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
the
naan
is
actually
fire
,
the
dal
could
use
some
work
,
and
the
tandoori
chicken
can
have
some
more
masala
but
it
’
s
good
for
dining
hall
food
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
naan
is
added
to
the
list
of
foods
you
just
can
'
t
mess
up
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ooo
never
It
is
just
amazing
[sskarz]
do
they
have
other
types
of
naan
like
garlic
or
cheese
?
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
having
for
dinner
?
[sskarz]
not
having
dinner
tonight
i
hit
my
macros
for
today
using
myfitnesspal
😎
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
really
[sskarz]
its
honestly
such
a
useful
tool
,
that
app
is
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
won
’
t
you
get
hungry
[sskarz]
nope
im
not
hungry
at
all
you
know
a
cool
thing
about
the
body
alot
of
the
time
you
feel
hungry
,
almost
half
the
time
its
due
to
the
fact
that
you
'
re
just
dehydrated
and
a
good
way
of
finding
out
which
one
it
is
,
is
literally
just
drinking
water
when
you
'
re
hungry
if
you
are
,
then
you
need
food
.
if
not
,
then
you
just
needed
water
in
the
system
[prabipyakurel]
Huh
that
’
s
cool
,
you
know
I
still
need
to
get
into
the
habit
of
drinking
water
I
fear
that
one
day
I
will
actually
be
extremely
dehydrated
and
like
fall
[sskarz]
something
that
helped
me
is
keeping
my
water
bottle
in
sight
at
all
times
hey
now
,
take
your
water
bottle
with
you
if
you
can
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
do
that
now
,
but
sometimes
it
just
doesn
’
t
happen
,
but
i
will
get
used
to
it
Yea
I
will
for
sure
[sskarz]
good
good
:)
yeah
just
something
to
get
used
to
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
can
’
t
tell
you
how
many
time
my
family
has
told
me
to
drink
water
,
like
over
the
weekend
I
used
to
drink
water
after
breakfast
and
lunch
and
that
would
be
it
My
mom
had
to
call
and
remind
us
Well
me
,
my
brother
just
drinks
randomly
😂
[sskarz]
your
brother
be
doing
his
own
thing
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
all
the
time
,
he
has
like
his
whole
own
world
[sskarz]
im
jealous
,
i
want
my
whole
own
world
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Not
that
type
trust
me
[sskarz]
😂
you
know
now
that
i
think
about
it
,
and
yes
this
is
random
but
just
a
thought
,
to
live
in
a
world
with
no
one
else
sounds
scary
,
but
also
at
the
same
time
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
I
swear
younger
brothers
be
like
in
their
own
world
doing
their
own
things
in
an
annoying
way
[sskarz]
that
'
s
meee
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
scary
,
imagine
,
can
’
t
even
piss
anyone
off
for
fun
😂
Probably
how
your
sister
sees
you
[sskarz]
oh
200
%
👍
you
get
a
lot
of
enjoyment
from
that
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
And
you
know
being
nice
,
but
for
the
main
part
,
messing
with
people
[sskarz]
can
'
t
live
without
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Especially
now
that
you
are
my
go
to
person
to
mess
with
,
can
’
t
imagine
living
lonely
[sskarz]
oh
me
neither
,
i
need
you
to
be
bothering
me
😂
its
only
right
:)
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
,
you
don
’
t
have
to
stress
over
that
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
why
does
that
baby
look
so
old
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
I
thought
that
was
only
me
[sskarz]
like
the
face
[prabipyakurel]
I
sent
that
and
I
started
laughing
at
it
[sskarz]
it
looks
so
off
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Well
anyway

are
you

rn
?
[sskarz]

some
youtube
and
reading
articles
[prabipyakurel]
Reading
articles

[sskarz]
i
came
home
expecting
to
do
alot
of
work
,
and
then
i
realized
its
just
the
first
day
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Fr

turn

changing
you
💀
[sskarz]

your
morning

chai
and

reading
articles
since
like
i
was
born
😭
but
fr
i

get
the
chai
and
the
newspaper
and
might
as
well
start
licking
my
thumb
to
turn
the
pages
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
That
Indian
dad
thing
tho
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
is
that
from
a
pakistani
serial
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
Not
sure
It
’
s
from
some
dramatic
show
tho
,
the
lady
’
s
eyes
is
saying
it
all
[sskarz]
yeah
you
already
know
like
40
seconds
is
gonna
be
spent
looking
at
each
other
'
s
facial
expressions
😂
in
slow
mo
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
[sskarz]

finished
with
dinner
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
let
me
get
back
up
to
the
room
and
we
will
talk
.
[sskarz]
no
worries
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
welcome
back
!
i
got
called
into
an
emergency
meeting
from
my
club
but
i
'
m
good
now
whatchu
doin
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
is
it
something
bad
?
[sskarz]
no
well
the
president
forgot
to
plan
a
tabling
event
for
our
club
and
now
im
in
charge
of
it
on
thursday
:/
[prabipyakurel]
Not
much
,
reviewing
for
tomorrrow
,
and
ik
you
told
me
not
to
stress
,
but
i
am
fr
freaking
out
Ahhh
gotcha
,
well
you
are
in
charge
,
just
dont
spell
anything
wrong
and
you
are
all
good
.
👍
[sskarz]
hey
hey
you
'
re
going
to
be
okay
its
a
big
step
for
you
,
first
day
of
class
in
college
and
starting
the
life
but
its
like
any
other
class
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
am
not
ready
[sskarz]
why
do
you
feel
so
?
what
part
of
you
isn
'
t
ready
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont
know
why
i
feel
that
way
,
but
like
no
part
of
me
is
ready
,
I
already
feel
like
I
am
behind
and
messing
up
.
[sskarz]
you
haven
'
t
even
started
!
you
can
'
t
even
mess
up
even
if
you
wanted
to
,
you
can
'
t
even
fall
behind
if
it
hasn
'
t
started
.
Imagine
everyone
else
right
now
,
in
your
freshman
class
.
Do
you
think
they
are
all
going
to
know
the
entire
class
material
,
or
even
be
expected
to
?
Of
course
not
!
It
'
s
the
same
thing
,
no
one
is
going
to
expect
you
to
know
the
entire
class
course
work
and
be
able
to
pass
calc
1
in
a
week
.
And
that
'
s
okay
!!!!
It
'
s
okay
to
not
know
everything
right
from
the
beginning
.
That
doesn
'
t
mean
you
'
re
going
to
fall
behind
at
all
.
Even
if
you
knew
everything
,
would
it
seriously
change
anything
?
The
nervousness
,
the
stress
,
the
feeling
of
not
being
able
to
perform
under
pressure
of
work
and
time
management
is
all
still
going
to
be
there
.
And
it
seems
scary
,
you
know
I
just
listed
all
of
those
things
and
I
probably
made
you
feel
even
worse
.
But
believe
me
when
I
say
,
you
'
re
not
expected
to
know
everything
.
I
know
you
well
enough
to
say
that
you
won
'
t
just
be
more
than
fine
,
but
you
'
re
going
to
excel
.
You
'
re
going
to
be
the
best
person
in
that
classroom
,
in
that
subject
,
and
everyone
will
see
you
as
the
smart
kid
in
class
!
You
are
nothing
short
of
incredible
potential
,
you
'
ve
proved
it
to
not
just
me
,
but
everyone
.
Don
'
t
let
your
fears
taunt
or
control
you
,
remember
you
are
either
your
biggest
ally
,
or
the
worst
enemy
.
And
what
changes
from
an
enemy
to
ally
,
is
a
change
of
perspective
.
So
take
this
change
of
perspective
,
the
perspective
of
being
okay
with
going
into
something
knowing
nothing
,
but
knowing
that
you
will
know
more
each
day
to
conquer
the
next
challenge
.
❤
️
I
can
guarantee
you
that
after
a
week
,
you
will
slowly
adapt
to
this
new
style
of
learning
,
living
,
and
everything
in
between
.
It
'
s
just
life
,
it
'
s
how
we
live
everyday
.
We
all
don
'
t
know
what
we
'
re
going
to
do
at
every
moment
of
the
next
day
,
no
one
does
.
There
'
s
no
way
to
prepare
for
such
a
thing
if
you
really
think
about
it
.
Yeah
you
can
plan
it
out
,
but
will
you
know
every
step
you
take
,
every
breath
that
you
take
,
the
movement
of
your
eyes
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
keep
in
mind
,
and
it
starts
to
become
overwhelming
.
The
perspective
of
being
okay
when
in
the
dark
,
when
you
'
re
just
lost
,
it
'
s
helped
me
too
.
It
helps
you
be
okay
even
when
times
,
it
all
just
looks
so
daunting
Maybe
for
you
it
might
be
just
the
complete
opposite
of
everything
I
'
ve
said
,
if
that
'
s
the
case
then
feel
free
to
tell
me
and
yell
at
me
and
everything
.
But
odds
are
,
you
will
be
okay
!
More
than
that
,
you
will
thrive
.
Keep
that
in
your
mental
as
you
go
and
learn
tomorrow
,
go
in
with
the
mindset
of
being
ready
to
learn
and
take
on
whatever
comes
your
way
.
It
'
ll
help
with
the
anxiety
and
stress
that
follows
.
It
won
'
t
totally
leave
you
,
but
trust
me
when
I
say
it
really
helps
.
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
words
for
you
literally
you
are
the
best
person
in
the
world
.
You
gonna
make
me
cry
,
thank
you
so
much
,
I
will
keep
your
words
in
mind
and
I
will
go
to
class
tomorrow
with
positive
thoughts
.
I
am
sorry
if
I
made
you
write
a
lot
lol
,
you
are
such
a
beautiful
soul
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Awwwwww
no
no
don
'
t
cry
!!
I
'
m
sorry
,
I
didn
'
t
mean
to
get
that
reaction
from
you
.
I
want
to
empower
you
,
to
show
you
that
you
have
what
it
takes
to
be
the
best
,
to
be
the
one
that
conquers
,
to
be
so
confident
in
your
own
abilities
.
It
'
s
hard
,
there
'
s
a
reason
why
its
the
highest
peak
in
Maslow
'
s
Hierarchy
of
Needs
.
When
you
reach
that
level
,
you
become
an
unstoppable
person
.
A
person
who
'
s
will
can
'
t
change
,
who
'
s
mind
can
'
t
be
changed
from
what
they
want
to
do
,
and
you
become
the
best
.
You
have
what
it
takes
,
I
know
you
do
.
I
believe
in
you
,
and
you
'
re
one
of
the
smartest
,
kindest
,
nicest
,
clumsiest
people
I
'
ve
ever
known
.
But
that
makes
you
you
,
and
that
makes
me
want
to
uplift
your
spirits
when
you
'
re
down
.
So
when
I
say
that
you
will
be
the
best
,
god
damn
it
you
'
re
going
to
be
the
best
!
Put
that
in
your
own
head
,
it
may
seem
a
little
egotistical
and
totally
not
humble
,
but
sometimes
you
need
that
fire
.
That
confidence
will
help
you
conquer
those
problems
that
seem
like
brick
walls
.
It
'
s
a
crazy
powerful
tool
that
I
believe
in
.
❤
️
When
I
'
m
feeling
overwhelmed
,
I
like
to
think
about
how
I
didn
'
t
want
to
let
all
my
efforts
in
life
go
to
waste
.
You
know
,
I
get
this
feeling
with
basic
chores
sometimes
,
and
it
sounds
ridiculous
I
know
.
There
have
been
times
where
I
'
ve
been
so
mentally
and
physically
exhausted
that
there
was
nothing
more
than
just
wanting
to
be
erased
from
the
world
for
a
couple
days
.
Just
so
I
had
no
responsibilities
,
nothing
to
think
about
,
and
I
could
ease
my
mind
.
But
I
can
'
t
do
that
,
I
'
ve
got
a
future
to
fight
for
.
A
future
where
I
'
m
successful
in
life
,
whatever
that
may
be
.
A
future
that
my
old
past
self
would
look
up
at
and
couldn
'
t
fathom
the
idea
of
being
there
.
That
'
s
what
I
fight
for
,
every
single
day
.
And
it
gets
me
through
any
challenge
that
throws
itself
at
me
.
All
of
this
strife
and
struggle
will
seem
like
a
good
memory
down
the
road
.
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
so
much
,
I
feel
better
and
ready
now
to
be
honest
,
yea
you
are
right
,
I
can
do
this
.
Imma
walk
to
class
tomorrow
with
confidence
and
be
ready
for
whatever
happens
in
there
.
God
you
should
be
a
therapist
or
something
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
God
no
,
I
couldn
'
t
do
this
for
a
living
for
random
people
😂
I
'
m
passionate
about
helping
those
I
care
about
and
achieving
their
max
potentials
I
want
to
see
you
be
the
best
that
you
can
ever
be
,
it
would
make
me
the
happiest
than
anything
you
could
say
to
me
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Fr
no
but
the
way
you
help
me
get
through
this
thing
,
I
will
always
be
thankful
for
you
.
❤

[sskarz]
It
'
s
what
I

best
version
of

[sskarz]
You
'
re
seeing
it
now
,
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
here
,
but
just
know
its
possible
❤
️
❤
️
Believe
in
yourself
,
give
yourself
that
power
,
and
your
name
might
as
well
be
Alexander
the
Great
the
way
you
will
conquer
every
challenge
your
way
a
little
cheesy
I
know
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
not
cheesy
,
it
makes
sense
.
[sskarz]
A
little
bit
of
an
ancient
example
,
but
imagine
you
are
Sisyphus
.
The
guy
that
was
forced
the
eternal
punishment
of
forever
rolling
up
the
boulder
uphill
.
He
never
stopped
,
no
matter
how
tired
he
got
,
no
matter
if
his
legs
were
bound
to
disintegrate
,
he
kept
pushing
that
rock
up
that
hill
Keep
that
same
fire
in
you
!
and
if
you
don
'
t
know
what
I
'
m
talking
about
,
here
'
s
the
picture
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
yea
this
one
,
dw
for
sure
,
I
will
keep
my
head
up
and
keep
going
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Now
that
'
s
what
I
like
to
hear
!!!!
I
'
m
proud
of
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
so
glad
to
have
you
as
a
friend
,
thank
you
😊
❤
️
❤

[sskarz]
And
same
to
you
❤
️
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
feel
so
relieved
and
ready
now
.
[sskarz]
I
'
m
so
relieved
that
you
feel
relieved
haha
I
'
m
glad
you
feel
ready
now
,
you
just
let
me
know
if
those
thoughts
come
back
to
your
head
I
'
m
gonna
smack
them
out
of
you
[prabipyakurel]
😂
For
sure
,
I
appreciate
it
,
like
I
really
do
.
Like
I
said
before
I
don
’
t
see
how
anyone
can
ever
dislike
you
,
you
know
those
hearts
you
get
when
you
get
Starbucks
,
yea
those
are
a
sign
from
god
,
it
’
s
hard
to
find
someone
with
such
a
kind
heart
especially
in
this
generation
,
you
deserve
those
hearts
.
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
well
I
guess
good
karma
is
catching
up
,
it
'
s
a
sign
of
good
things
to
come
You
know
,
when
you
truly
understand
how
perspective
can
impact
your
life
,
its
just
a
life
hack
It
'
s
the
#
1
thing
that
really
helped
me
in
my
19
years
of
life
And
it
took
me
about
17
years
to
realize
it
fully
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
pray
that
only
good
things
come
for
you
always
.
[sskarz]
Aw
thanks
,
means
a
lot
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
you
helped
me
get
through
this
dumb
situation
,
you
have
all
my
respect
and
everything
.
You
have
done
a
lot
for
me
really
.
Took
my
mind
off
a
lot
of
things
.
[sskarz]
It
'
s
why
I
'
m
here
for
you
,
its
why
I
keep
going
❤
️
Helping
you
and
others
just
fuels
me
too
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
Ironically
listening
to
some
sad
and
soothing
music
dw
I
'
m
not
sad
or
anything
,
it
'
s
just
...
that
thing
yk
?
idk
how
to
explain
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
no
I
do
that
sometimes
too
,
I
be
having
a
relaxing
day
and
I
my
ears
are
like
the
saddest
lyrics
playing
[sskarz]
just
something
about
it
,
really
calms
me
down
and
it
all
feels
like
its
going
to
be
okay
[prabipyakurel]
No
completely
understand
[sskarz]
nope
you
first
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
[sskarz]
nuh
uh
i
went
first
last
time
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
didn
’
t
😠
Please
[sskarz]
uhh
i
got
the
receipts
yes
i
didddddddd
ah
well
i
can
'
t
argue
with
you
haha
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
you
really
can
’
t
Now
you
go
[sskarz]
There
'
s
an
album
I
listen
to
when
I
feel
like
I
'
m
really
stressed
or
anxious
.
It
'
s
called
Circles
by
Mac
Miller
,
and
it
was
his
last
ever
project
.
But
what
'
s
so
special
about
it
is
the
way
it
feels
like
he
speaks
directly
to
you
,
in
like
a
therapeutic
sense
And
so
I
just
put
that
album
on
,
but
not
because
I
'
m
stressed
or
anxious
,
just
that
it
'
s
nice
to
hear
someone
talking
like
they
'
re
going
through
the
same
things
and
living
through
it
Idk
if
you
could
tell
yet
,
but
I
have
a
deep
connection
with
music
and
how
it
affects
my
moods
and
attitudes
towards
things
.
And
this
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
ones
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
that
’
s
smart
,
but
hey
I
’
m
here
if
you
need
advice
or
anything
,
I
will
give
you
everything
I
got
with
minimal
spelling
errors
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
haha
I
know
,
don
'
t
worry
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
get
that
,
so
music
has
a
way
of
connecting
to
you
in
a
deeper
way
.
[sskarz]
It
'
s
just
how
I
feel
and
exemplify
my
emotions
It
'
s
why
I
collect
vinyls
.
Albums
that
have
either
changed
my
life
,
or
I
'
ve
connected
to
on
a
deep
level
It
'
s
how
I
remind
myself
of
what
music
has
done
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
as
long
as
it
makes
you
feel
better
and
heals
you
,
you
do
you
,
music
is
awesome
,
I
love
listening
to
random
music
.
This
things
are
really
pretty
tho
,
like
I
know
nothing
about
them
but
they
are
a
big
part
of
your
life
and
that
’
s
really
cool
You
started
your
connection
to
music
in
high
school
right
?
[sskarz]
They
are
pretty
nice
haha
,
thank
you
.
❤
️
Actually
right
after
high
school
when
I
was
going
into
college
I
was
just
as
anxious
and
nervous
as
you
And
I
never
really
listened
to
music
prior
to
that
But
it
really
was
that
thing
that
helped
me
It
just
helped
me
deal
with
emotions
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
so
it
has
been
like
a
year
or
2
right
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
was
talking
to
you
then
,
I
would
have
told
you
that
you
would
have
succeeded
in
every
way
possible
.
For
sure
,
some
music
are
really
captivating
and
like
you
can
relate
to
it
a
lot
.
[sskarz]
hahaha
,
well
honestly
,
this
sounds
weird
,
but
I
'
ve
made
more
progress
as
a
person
in
every
regard
in
the
last
2
years
,
than
I
'
ve
ever
had
in
my
years
prior
to
that
just
comparing
myself
to
how
I
was
when
I
was
younger
it
'
s
like
night
and
day
I
wish
I
could
go
back
in
time
and
show
you
,
you
wouldn
'
t
believe
it
[prabipyakurel]
What
was
so
different
about
you
high
school
years
and
post
high
school
years
into
college
?
You
don
’
t
have
to
answer
that
,
hope
I
am
not
being
nosy
[sskarz]
no
no
you
'
re
not
at
all
,
again
,
I
'
m
an
open
book
you
ask
away
,
I
'
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
[prabipyakurel]
U
still
there
?
[sskarz]
If
I
could
say
it
in
one
word
.
I
'
d
say
Perspective
.
I
used
to
be
so
overly
negative
.
I
hated
how
I
looked
,
how
I
acted
,
how
I
did
things
,
how
I
thought
.
During
my
middle
school
years
,
I
fell
into
a
depressive
hole
and
it
caused
me
to
set
my
entire
life
on
fire
.
There
were
times
where
I
contemplated
running
away
from
everything
and
everyone
,
and
doing
worse
things
.
For
a
few
years
,
I
loathed
every
day
.
The
friends
I
talked
to
I
couldn
'
t
care
less
about
,
the
things
I
did
and
said
held
no
weight
.
I
was
just
so
...
like
I
felt
as
if
everything
was
just
so
much
higher
and
I
felt
like
it
was
impossible
to
climb
out
of
that
hole
yk
?
When
you
feel
like
you
'
re
so
low
,
that
the
bottom
floor
is
closer
than
getting
out
,
so
you
just
sink
.
This
carried
with
me
all
the
way
into
high
school
,
till
about
Junior
year
of
high
school
.
I
started
to
realize
what
I
was
doing
to
myself
and
how
it
also
impacted
those
around
me
.
It
wasn
'
t
enough
to
fully
make
me
realize
,
but
it
made
me
change
slowly
.
Of
course
I
couldn
'
t
share
these
feelings
with
anyone
,
I
kept
it
all
to
myself
and
put
on
a
fake
smile
for
years
on
end
.
And
then
high
school
ended
,
and
my
life
took
a
turn
.
My
perspective
just
changed
,
like
I
just
had
to
snap
out
of
it
.
And
ever
since
then
,
I
'
ve
changed
my
entire
character
,
my
entire
person
,
and
my
entire
perspective
of
how
I
view
life
and
people
and
family
and
friends
and
loved
ones
.
It
sounds
crazy
,
and
honestly
,
I
haven
'
t
reflected
this
hard
in
a
while
,
but
it
'
s
true
.
You
wouldn
'
t
have
liked
me
if
you
knew
who
I
was
back
then
.
How
can
you
like
someone
that
didn
'
t
like
themselves
.
Thankfully
,
I
'
m
nowhere
even
close
to
who
I
used
to
be
.
I
'
m
so
much
happier
being
who
I
am
today
,
than
I
would
ever
have
been
.
I
love
myself
to
the
upmost
degree
,
and
my
self
esteem
has
never
ever
been
higher
Even
when
I
make
mistakes
today
,
I
just
think
about
the
shit
I
'
ve
already
gone
and
done
,
and
it
all
seems
so
miniscule
.
Like
nothing
could
compare
to
what
those
years
did
I
know
I
'
m
really
putting
myself
out
there
,
and
you
know
maybe
this
isn
'
t
what
you
wanted
to
hear
but
I
want
to
be
honest
This
is
who
I
was
,
this
is
who
I
am
today
.
And
this
is
just
me
,
all
of
it
It
'
s
why
I
preach
so
much
about
optimism
and
perspective
,
because
that
'
s
what
got
me
out
of
all
of
that
.
Without
that
,
I
wouldn
'
t
be
who
I
am
today
,
not
even
close
[prabipyakurel]
First
of
all
thank
you
for
sharing
,
it
takes
a
lot
to
reflect
on
the
time
that
has
passed
.
And
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
had
to
go
through
so
much
but
you
got
out
of
it
and
now
you
are
doing
your
best
.
And
one
thing
you
gotta
remember
is
to
love
yourself
always
,
I
mean
you
always
here
from
others
but
from
how
much
I
know
you
,
you
are
like
so
amazing
.
And
yea
you
might
have
felt
like
you
wanted
to
be
someone
else
,
look
different
,
and
maybe
see
things
differently
,
but
you
got
through
those
things
on
your
own
and
it
already
tells
me
how
strong
of
a
person
you
are
.
Thank
you
for
sharing
again
,
I
will
keep
this
to
myself
dw
,
I
am
not
telling
anyone
.
And
your
smile
is
precious
,
keep
it
on
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Thank
you
like
seriously
,
thank
you
❤
️
And
I
hope
it
didn
'
t
change
of
how
you
think
of
me
.
I
understand
if
it
did
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
hey
you
were
perfect
the
time
I
met
you
,
you
still
are
,
and
will
remain
perfect
as
long
as
I
live
[sskarz]
And
I
'
m
sorry
for
putting
all
of
this
on
your
shoulder
too
,
I
just
kind
of
spilled
out
like
a
leaking
bottle
[prabipyakurel]
It
didn
’
t
change
how
I
think
or
you
and
won
’
t
ever
,
it
was
part
of
your
growth
and
I
respect
you
for
sharing
,
it
shows
that
you
are
past
it
and
you
have
thrived
.
No
don
’
t
ever
think
of
it
that
way
,
it
’
s
okay
to
share
.
[sskarz]
hey
I
'
m
the
farthest
thing
from
perfect
,
I
'
ve
just
gone
through
a
lot
to
make
who
I
am
today
But
thank
you

back
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
sorry
if
I
made
you
remember
things
that
you
had
forgotten
about
[sskarz]
No
no
its
okay
,
sometimes
its
healthy
to
remember
where
you
come
from
it
helps
me
keep
going
as
hard
as
I
do
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
And
it
should
,
you
went
though
your
toughest
moment
alone

by
it
all
,
I
don

t

how
I
could
thank
you

❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No

about
your
past
is
going
to
change
the
way
that
I

about
you
in
anyway
,
like
I

from
where
I
am
standing

you

[sskarz]
mmmmm

I
'
m
speaking
the
truth

s
how
it
'
s
going
to

to

!
👍
[prabipyakurel]
U
first
[sskarz]
wait
where
did
the
time
go
I
felt
like
I
just
put
that
album
on
,
and
it
just
finished
whatttt
[prabipyakurel]
Time
flies
Suuuuuuper
fast
[sskarz]
and
its
already

that
'
s
nuts
wait
im
dumb
,

reading
is
hard
😂
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
you
know
idk
if
your
parents
do
it
either
,
but
my
dad
loves
to
wake
me
up
and
say
"
omg
wake
up
its
already
10am
"
when
its
barely
8
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
that
is
their
signature
move
They
love
barging
in
and
being
all
“
how
long
are
you
going
to
sleep
”
it
’
s
7
:
55
you
going
to
be
late
for
school
,
and
it
’
s
literally
6
:

😂
[sskarz]
NO
BUT
FR
LOL
[prabipyakurel]
Indian
parents
literally
move
the
time
But
they
be
late
to
everything
[sskarz]
that
'
s
part
of
the
reason
why
i
love
college
more
than
high
school
,
like
i
'
m
on
my
own
schedule
and
i
don
'
t
have
to
wake
up
at
like
6
if
i
don
'
t
need
to
literally
the
best
everytime
😂
without
fail
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
’
m
slowly
getting
used
to
that
😂
Hey
so
you
know
how
earlier
you
said
you
found
someone
who
was
worthy
,
can
I
get
like
a
name
or
a
hint
,
do
I
know
the
person
or
no
?
Just
curious
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
well
technically
I
'
ve
given
a
hint
already
and
I
'
ll
leave
it
at
that
[prabipyakurel]
Where
,
I
didn
’
t
get
no
hint
Tell
me
the
hint
again
[sskarz]
no
no
I
did
give
one
and
the
hint
is
that
I
'
ve
technically
given
a
hint
already
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahahaha
well
its
no
fun
if
I
just
say
it
outright
[prabipyakurel]
I
probably
don
’
t
even
know
them
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
leave
it
up
to
interpretation
who
knows
maybe
they
don
'
t
even
exist
in
the
first
place
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
literally
gonna
make
me
reread
2
months
worth
of
text
to
see
a
hint
that
you
may
or
may
not
have
said
[sskarz]
the
world
may
never
know
well
hey
that
'
s
up
to
you
if
you
care
about
it
that
much
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmmm
we
shall
see
But
a
hint
won
’
t
hurt
,
lol
like
I
said
I
probably
won
’
t
know
who
they
are
anyway
[sskarz]
haha
you
'
re
not
getting
anything
more
from
me
,
I
'
ve
said
all
I
'
ve
needed
to
say
Unless
you
give
me
a
hint
,
then
perhaps
a
negotiation
could
be
held
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmmm
[sskarz]
**
jeopardy
music
**
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
stopppp
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
How
dare
you
[sskarz]
huhhhh
now
you
have
that
music
in
your
head
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
sorry
,
I
am
too
gullible
I
will
give
it
up
if
I
start
with
hints
[sskarz]
ah
but
you
'
re
dealing
with
someone
incredibly
stupid
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
not
that
stupid
[sskarz]
oh
the
stories
I
have
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
get
that
name
out
of
you
one
day
,
can
you
tell
me
something
about
the
person
.
[sskarz]
again
,
technically
,
i
'
ve
already
told
this
information
my
hint
to
you
was
that
i
already
gave
a
hint
technically
so
good
luck
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
you
are
evil
👿
[sskarz]
maybe
I
am
😈
[prabipyakurel]
Bro
there
is
no
sort
of
hint
that
I
caught
on
to
[sskarz]
we
could
hold
a
negotiation
for
an
extra
hint
if
you
drop
a
hint
too
a
hint
for
a
hint
[prabipyakurel]
Deal
Let
me
think
for
a
min
[sskarz]
oh

[prabipyakurel]
Nah

you
too

of
shit
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
You

s
true
so
technically
its
a
good
hint
so
,
your
honor
,
the
defendant
is
completely
valid
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
client
(
myself
)
has
been
speaking
facts
,
on
my
white
nikes
,
your
honor

court
dramas

[prabipyakurel]
You
don

a
better
hint
that
that
Nah
you
can
’
t
[sskarz]
its
an
eye
for
an
eye
,
i
never
said
the
hint
would
be
of
any
higher
quality
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
it
give
me
another
letter
[sskarz]
well
that
'
s
because
I
'
d
like
for
you
to
get
some
quality
sleep
for
your
big
day
tomorrow
instead
of
wasting
your
time
on
trying
to
get
a
hint
out
of
me
💀
an
eye
for
an
eye
,
you
must
provide
another
hint
[prabipyakurel]
You

this
time
[sskarz]

but
i
went
first
on
the
first
round
[prabipyakurel]
Uh

didn
’
t
[sskarz]
this
is
round

[prabipyakurel]
I
said

letter
A

[
[prabipyakurel]
Your
turn

the
second
round
[sskarz]

ready
for
this
[prabipyakurel]
Make
this
dumb
and
I
will
give
you
a
dumb
one
[sskarz]
This
person
is
of
gender
:
female
[prabipyakurel]
Sure
yea
it
’
s
a
boy
[sskarz]
hey
what
if
i
was
gay
this
entire
time
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

No

[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
'
m

[prabipyakurel]
Was
that

hint
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Im
about
to
appear
in
your
dream
and
slap
you
[sskarz]
😂
that
would
certainly
be
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
No
letter
then
[sskarz]
well
my
hint
wasn
'
t
a
letter
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
just
one
more
[sskarz]

to
go
now
that
was
my
turn
[prabipyakurel]
I
said

,

’
s
a
BOY
That
’
s
was
my
hint
[sskarz]
ohhh
mhmm
mhmmm
i
understood
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
So
you
and
me
are
on
the
same
boat
[sskarz]
well
its
your
turn
to
go
first
then
[prabipyakurel]
Well
this
person
is
either
starting
college
or
in
college
at
the
moment
Don
’
t
you
dare
say
something
similar
[sskarz]
awwww
but
damn
that
would
'
ve
been
a
good
answer
for
me
😂
fine
i
won
'
t
i
'
ll
give
a
really
good
hint
how
about
that
lets
test
your
memory
[prabipyakurel]
For
real
[sskarz]
and
how
about
i
tell
this
in
a
riddle
?
since
its
a
good
hint
[prabipyakurel]
Ig
[sskarz]
haha
i
can
see
your
annoyed
,
its
funny
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Haha
glad
you
find
it
funny
Go
on
[sskarz]
hold
on
let
me
curate
it
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
To
the
waves
that
carry
A
sign
was
shown
A
place
unimaginable
And
unfathomable
There
in
their
eyes
they
witnessed
Witnessed
with
me
The
letter
that
spelled
thee
There
you
go
So
..?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
You
came
up
with
this
[sskarz]
Yes
I
did
Did
you
already
figure
it
out
?
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
or
maybe
I
am
reading
it
wrong
[sskarz]
Well
that
'
s
up
to
you
I
won
'
t
say
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmm
“
The
letter
that
spelled
thee
”
[sskarz]
What
about
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
None
of
those
give
me
a
name
nothing
[sskarz]
Well
they
do
call
these
a
riddle
for
a
reason
[prabipyakurel]
It
sounds
more
like
a
poem
Where
is
the
riddle
in
this
[sskarz]
well
if
I
told
you
,
it
would
become
incredibly
obvious
Maybe
it
'
ll
click
with
you
one
day
And
if
it
doesn
'
t
,
so
be
it
:)
[prabipyakurel]
But
why
don
’
t
you
wanna
share
?
I
will
figure
it
out
somehow
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
already
shared
it
You
just
need
to
think
a
bit
harder
The
poem
should
give
you
a
direction
[prabipyakurel]
Pinned
a
message
.
[sskarz]
and
technically
,
it
points
to
the
exact
person
You
solve
the
poem
,
you
solve
this
entire
question
I
really
can
'
t
give
you
more
than
that
[prabipyakurel]
How
will
I
know
if
I
am
right
?
[sskarz]
You
'
ll
know
Think
back
to
what
I
said
,
and
perhaps
you
'
ll
see
something
is
out
of
place
and
no
,
I
don
'
t
mean
the
poem
:)
[prabipyakurel]
About
what
you
said
today
?
[sskarz]
Who
said
it
limits
to
today
?
😈
[prabipyakurel]
You
fr
evil
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
I
have
an
idea
[sskarz]
Maybe
you
do
Who
will
actually
know
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
may
just
be
stupid
for
thinking
of
it
that
way
[sskarz]
When
you
know
,
you
'
ll
know
The
poem
is
staring
and
screaming
the
answer
,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
...
think
about
it
a
little
thinking
exercise
built
just
for
you
:)
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
all
the
lines
and
they
all
sound
different
except
one
But
idk
if
i
broke
it
down
correctly
[sskarz]
And
I
can
neither
confirm
nor
deny
When
you
are
sure
,
you
take
the
leap
of
faith
[prabipyakurel]
By
leap
of
faith
,
you
mean
share
the
name
[sskarz]
Do
I
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
way
too
annoying
at
this
point
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
I
'
m
confident
you
'
ll
figure
it
all
out
I
made
it
specifically
for
you
anyway
So
here
'
s
my
last
hint
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
[sskarz]
and
what
I
'
ve
been
talking
about
all
day
**
Perspective
**
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
you
figured
it
out
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
[sskarz]
How
confident
are
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
Not
sure
,
I
might
just
be
imagining
things
[sskarz]
You
could
be
all
wrong
for
all
you
know
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
suggesting
anything
,
just
realizing
it
all
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
a
little
confident
I
am
starting
to
see
it
a
little
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
Well
once
you
'
re
100
%
confident
,
you
'
ll
know
personally
,
I
'
m
really
proud
of
that
poem
I
made
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
a
really
good
poem
I
liked
it
[sskarz]
well
if
you
realize
it
fully
,
it
'
s
kind
of
ingenious
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
,
just
unsure
about
the
confidence
level
[sskarz]
So
you
haven
'
t
completely
solved
the
poem
then
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
have
[sskarz]
Damn
that
was
fast
lol
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
just
a
part
of
it
that
I
am
looking
at
over
and
over
again
[sskarz]
What
line
?
if
I
could
ask
[prabipyakurel]
“
The
letter
that
spelled
thee
”
[sskarz]
Oh
Really
?
If
you
solved
it
,
that
should
'
ve
been
the
easiest
thing
to
figure
out
Well
it
should
'
ve
been
obvious
if
you
solved
everything
else
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
a
train
of
thought
[sskarz]
Glad
its
got
you
thinking
Don
'
t
be
thinking
about
this
in
class
though
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
dw
I
am
not
bringing
this
into
class
You
can
help
me
by
giving
me
the
name
so
I

[sskarz]
😂
It
’
s
a
good
start

[prabipyakurel]
Ilike
how

[sskarz]
You

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

[sskarz]
Mhmm
of
course
So
your
class
starts
at
3
right
,
what
’
s
the
plan
till
then
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
starts
at
3
,
but
I
got
the
sociology
reading
for
tomorrow
,
and
I
dont
want
to
save
it
for
after
class
(
its
only
like
5
more
pages
to
read
really
)
so
I
think
I
will
just
do
that
,
go
do
laundry
if
I
can
and
eat
lunch
,
then
maybe
take
a
short
nap
before
getting
to
class
.
[sskarz]
Sounds
like
a
solid
plan
[prabipyakurel]
the
nap
is
a
maybe
,
i
dont
wanna
accidently
miss
my
first
class
[sskarz]
Wait
where
do
you
do
laundry
?
Is
there
like
a
public
one
in
the
dorms
?
Just
gotta
set
10
alarms
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
like
down
stairs
in
the
laundry
room
,
and
I
learned
yesterday
that
you
gotta
use
this
one
app
to
pay
and
you
need
to
put
in
a
credit
card
,
so
i
also
need
to
ask
baba
to
put
his
information
in
because
I
dont
got
no
job
yet
,
no
credit
card
,
im
broke
😭
😂
Just
got
cash
on
me
but
i
cant

that
[sskarz]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
okay
well
I
was
about
to
say
I
just
got
back
home
and
now
I
'
m
chillin
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
nice
,
well
my
class
was
kinda
weird
,
It
was
about
300
students
in
there
,
that
is
massive
first
of
all
.
And
second
of
all
,
he
is
scaring
the
shit
out
of
me
,
its
like
he
makes
it
sounds
like
we
will
be
fine
but
at
the
same
time
he
be
like
"
just
because
you
do
well
on
the
quizzes
does
not
mean
you
will
get
a
good
grade
on
the
finals
"
and
stuff
like
that
.
I
mean
he
just
went
over
the
syllabus
today
,
but
ugh
i
already
kinda
think
he
gonna
be
that
one
painful
professor
.
Also
got
an
updated
schedule
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
yeah
they
'
re
not
trying
to
scare
you
,
its
true
like
if
you
did
all
the
quizzes
and
got
100s
,
but
failed
the
final
,
you
might
fail
the
class
type
of
deal
.
Honestly
tho
,
it
'
s
never
been
an
issue
like
ever
,
so
don
'
t
worry
about
it
See
,
I
told
you
they
'
d
only
go
over
the
syllabus
for
the
first
day
also
300
students
?
damn
that
must
be
a
huge
lecture
hall
Pinned
a
message
.
What
did
you
change
?
Oh
discussions
,
I
see
that
now
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
i
see
,
yea
because
he
was
going
on
and
on
about
how
everything
will
be
like
,
and
he
is
all
like
,
you
know
you
might
fail
and
you
might
pass
.
I
thought
it
was
just
100
,
that
hall
was
not
that
big
I
was
surprised
when
he
said
that
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
pretty
nuts
I
'
m
not
a
fan
of
lecture
hall
type
classrooms
just
cause
its
hard
to
ask
questions
directly
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
he
was
like
,
i
dont
personally
take
questions
but
for
now
I
can
.
yea
it
will
be
hard
to
get
personal
help
from
the
dude
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
,
are
all
of
your
classes
in
lecture
halls
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
had
that
class
today
I
went
around
to
check
the
rest
of
my
classes
after
and
this
one
class
is
like
around
the
corner
in
this
foresty
area
and
I
just
couldn
'
t
go
in
there
alone
,
so
that
is
a
tomorrow
5pm
problem
I
also
saw
a
dead
squirrel
too
[sskarz]
ohhhh
,
no
no
its
like
you
know
in
harry
potter
when
they
go
outside
of
the
castle
and
then
find
hagrid
'
s
house
yeah
basically
same
thing
right
😂
um
,
it
dead
fr
fr
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
there
is
this
really
old
building
i
swear
,
its
the
oldest
building
,
i
will
show
you
a
picture
of
it
someday
first
picture
is
the
dead
thing
and
the
second
one
,
you
can
hear
the
water
underneath
the
wood
Its
like
a
narrow
bridge
that
goes
through
a
creek
and
like
trees
and
stuff
[sskarz]
ohhh
that
'
s
pretty
cool
also
nice
GPS
💀
[prabipyakurel]
uh
no
,
i
cant
go
anywhere
without
putting
in
the
lecture
hall
building
I
put
that
thing
on
everywhere

'
t

a
long
walk

my
classes

like
back

fouth
around
campus
especially
tomorrow
lol
,
today
was
just
the
stress
of
that
one
class
,

tomorrow
in
the
heat
[sskarz]
make
sure
you
take
a
bottle
of
water
with
you
hydrate
yourself
constantly
!
[prabipyakurel]
Getting
better
at
that
,
i
also
had
a
nose
bleed
yesterday
so
that
was
a
gentle
reminder
to
drink
more
lol
[sskarz]
omg
take
better
care
of
yourself
water
is
important
,
you
don
'
t
wanna
get
a
heat
stroke
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
trying
my
best
,
i
dont
think
i
will
get
a
heat
stroke
,
but
yes
thank
you
I
will
stay
hydrated
[sskarz]
good
good
so

any
new
friends
at
class

[prabipyakurel]
No

the
girl
next
to
me
where
one
piece
of
information
was
,
thats
it
dont
know
her
,
never
saw
her
again
life
[sskarz]
it
really
be
like
that
lol
you
'
ll
make
friends
,
takes
time
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
its
gonna
take
some
time
,
but
i
will
find
people
i
mean
hopefully
otherwise
this
year
is
gonna
go
by
real
slow
and
lonely
[sskarz]
you
'
re
that
social
butterfly
,
i
'
m
sure
you
'
re
gonna
be
fine
plus
you
got
your
other
classes
,
you
'
ll
meet
way
more
people
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
really
try
,
but
sometimes
i
feel
like
people
gonna
find
me
weird
if
i
just
go
up
like
that
,
but
i
will
get
to
it
,
thanks
!
[sskarz]
haha
nobody
will
find
you
weird
,
hell
I
did
that
so
many
times
today
in
my
new
classes
and
now
I
know
them
better
you
will
be
ay
okay
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
wow
cool
,
did
you
just
start
a
conversation
with
them
?
But
you
are
like
a
chill
person
,
so
they
probably
just
connected
to
you
easily
[sskarz]
yeah
!
like
in
the
morning
,
I
overheard
a
guy
talk
about
replacing
some
of
his
pc
parts
and
I
just
joined
in
,
and
the
conversation
was
smooth
,
and
now
i
have
him
in
my
contacts
and
we
know
each
other
👍
you
'
re
chill
too
,
idk
why
anyone
would
think
you
'
d
be
weird
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
conversation
about
PC
parts
,
but
glad
you
met
someone
.
😂
[sskarz]
it
was
a
computer
science
class
,
what
else
do
you
expect
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
i
bet
you
just
slid
into
the
conversation
and
it
clicked
[sskarz]
well
its
something
im
super
familiar
with
and
i
like
partaking
in
those
kinds
of
conversations
what
i
like
to
do
is
get
to
classes
earlier
than
anyone
,
and
those
that
come
through
like
I
'
ll
try
and
talk
to
them
just
to
ensure
I
know
at
least
1
other
person
in
the
class
doesn
'
t
have
to
be
anything
meaningful
at
all
,
just
so
they
know
me
and
I
know
them
so
its
easier
for
us
to
communicate
later
down
the
road
like
planting
seeds
yk
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
i
got
there
earlier
too
,
but
like
there
were
a
few
people
there
already
talking
and
it
seemed
rude
to
interrupt
so
i
just
sat
and
waited
.
[sskarz]
*
maybe
i
am
the
weird
one
for
interrupting
*
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
That
thought
goes
through
my
head
,
like
i
meet
anyone
new
,
and
i
have
that
thought
that
goes
like
"
wait
what
if
i
am
being
nosy
or
disturbing
"
so
i
just
smile
and
wait
or
something
[sskarz]
ah
we
are
opposites
,
i
'
ll
just
strike
up
a
conversation
or
just
join
in
for
the
sake
of
joining
in
,
usually
before
class
best
time
to
make
friends
are
before
class
starts
or
even
like
the
sacred
method
,
ask
for
a
pencil
because
you
"
don
'
t
have
one
"
and
just
go
from
there
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
coming
into
college
and
asking
for
a
pencil
on
the
first
day
damn
sanskar
,
really
,
would
not
have
expected
that
fom
you
[sskarz]
you
'
d
be
surprised
of
how
often
that
happens
which
part
haha
the
pencil
trick
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[sskarz]
oh
cmon
its
the
easiest
thing
to
do
if
nothing
else
is
gonna
work
[prabipyakurel]
the
rest
matches
your
extroverted
personality
and
I
can
imagine
you
make
friends
fairly
easily
[sskarz]
works
so
often
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mmmmm
I
'
m
like
an
ambivert
lowkey
,
like
if
im
in
my
room
,
i
don
'
t
want
anyone
bothering
me
physically
,
but
if
im
outside
i
got
that
social
battery
👍
*
till
that
runs
out
,
but
we
hope
that
doesn
'
t
happen
*
😂
ok
well
do
NOT
ask
like
with
that
facial
expression
💀
i
'
d
be
so
creeped
out
lmfao
[prabipyakurel]
right
go
up
to
a
person
,
just
sit
in
that
position
in
front
of
them
,
be
all
like
that
,
"
so
what
if
i
borrowed
that
pen
of
yours
?"
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
please
don
'
t
try
it
,
its
obvious
you
don
'
t
know
the
sacred
technique
💀
no
no
it
goes
like
this
ahem
there
'
s
someone
sitting
to
my
right
,
they
look
cool
to
talk
to
i
whisper
as
if
im
trying
not
to
disturb
anyone
,
for
a
pencil
[prabipyakurel]
nah
I
am
not
asking
for
anything
,
I
will
just
go
say
hi
and
ask
them
some
math
question
[sskarz]
then
after
class
,
i
will
return
that
pencil
,
and
then
talk
with
them
afterwards
about
the
class
i
mean
that
works
too
haha
[prabipyakurel]
What
if
they
just
leave
and
let
you
keep
it
.
[sskarz]
doesn
'
t
happen
,
like
ever
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
whispering
into
a
random
persons
ear
[sskarz]
i
swear
this
technique
rarely
fails
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
just
tap
them
on
the
shoulder
and
then
ask
them
in
a
low
voice
,
not
necessarily
going
into
their
ear
canal
😂
LMAO
no
no
not
like
that
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
i
see
,
yea
sure
i
will
try
that
if
its
needed
😂
💯
[sskarz]
its
got
like
a
95
%
success
rate
but
that
'
s
not
really
my
go
to
,
that
'
s
like
last
resort
and
i
really
want
to
talk
to
a
specific
person
👍
i
usually
just
ask
someone
somthing
about
the
class
and
its
easy
from
there
[prabipyakurel]
somthing
huh
[sskarz]
like
literally
it
'
ll
be
:
oh
so
what
language
do
we
use
in
this
class
?
(
coding
language
)
and
its
just
too
easy
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
,
i
guess
that
can
work
[sskarz]
idk
why
i
feel
like
im
coaching
you
on
how
to
talk
to
people
💀
you
just
be
you
😂
if
you
'
re
you
,
then
people
will
naturally
come
to
you
simple
as
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
are
fine
lol
,
you
have
like
2
years
of
experience
Yea
lol
,
i
will
just
smile
at
someone
and
sit
alone
and
someone
will
be
like
,
do
you
know
where
to
go
[sskarz]
see
?
a
natural
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
just
be
me
and
see
how
it
goes
lo
,
gotta
be
another
lonely
person
out
there
[sskarz]
oh
please
you
'
re
not
gonna
be
lonely
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
i
try
,
but
it
randomly
happens
not
because
i
want
it
to
[sskarz]
and
sometimes
it
can
lead
to
beautiful
friendships
i
'
ve
met
alot
of
my
really
good
friends
because
they
came
up
to
me
,
and
i
had
no
interest
in
talking
to
them
but
as
i
learned
they
were
pretty
cool
people
so
it
all
worked
out
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
happened
a
lot
in
high
school
,
i
would
be
bumping
into
the
most
random
people
.
[sskarz]
college
is
literally
just
high
school
,
except
everyone
is
a
little
more
grown
up
and
there
'
s
so
much
more
freedom
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
starting
to
feel
like
that
[sskarz]
starting
to
feel
more
comfortable
?
[prabipyakurel]
a
little
yea
,
still
scared
but
better
.
[sskarz]
it
gets
better
every
day
[prabipyakurel]
like
more
of
the
excited
type
of
scared
now
Thanks
,
i
feel
like
i
understand
a
little
more
everyday
👍
[sskarz]
soon
enough
,
give
it
like
a
month
,
you
'
ll
be
going
around
campus
without
a
GPS
😂
and
of
course
,
feel
comfortable
with
the
entire
experience
at
least
familiar
with
it
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
!
the
gps
will
just
be
in
the
background
for
reference
you
know
so
what
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
nothing
really
,
just
sitting
at
my
desk
looking
through
assignments
that
are
due
in
a
week
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
,
i
finished
my
reading
assignment
before
class
tomorrow
and
i
am
just
drinking
this
one
tea
that
looked
interesting
from
the
dining
hall
i
dont
really
like
it
tbh
[sskarz]
what
kind
of
tea
was
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
some
mint
with
herbs
not
that
pleasant
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
that
sounds
interesting
idk
how
i
feel
about
that
lol
i
'
ve
never
really
tried
any
tea
of
that
kind
but
it
sounds
dubious
[prabipyakurel]
its
one
of
those
tea
bags
one
not
good
,
i
threw
it
out
in
the
sink
rn
[sskarz]
hmmm
yeah
maybe
don
'
t
get
that
tea
lol
[prabipyakurel]
im
not
getting
it
again
dw
i
need
to
go
buy
instant
coffee
for
the
dorm
[sskarz]
what
'
s
like
the
best
food
you
'
ve
found
so
far
while
being
there
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
am
being
honest
,
the
only
thing
I
had
here
was
the
momo
and
kinda
jamba
juice
but
other
than
than
,
you
know
how
I
was
a
sick
a
few
days
back
,
yea
still
trying
to
recover
before
I
try
a
bunch
of
unknown
food
.
I
got
time
,
lol
i
will
discover
[sskarz]
are
you
still
feeling
sick
?
like
is
it
getting
worse
or
better
[prabipyakurel]
Um
no
,
i
think
like
monday
afternoon
,
i
felt
like
I
was
sying
but
after
I
threw
up
,
I
have
felt
a
little
better
,
but
still
got
like
coughs
here
and
there
,
im
doing
a
lot
better
tho
and
the
appetite
is
like
barely
coming
back
[sskarz]
oh
my
i
had
no
idea
you
were
still
having
such
a
rough
time
i
thought
you
healed
after
that
convo
im
ngl
well
at
least
its
getting
better
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
its
not
rough
like
that
lol
,
maybe
getting
used
to
the
weather
here
too
i
also
just
choked
on
water
like
a
fool
[sskarz]
omg
prabi
you
'
re
getting
me
worried
😂
are
you
seriously
okay
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
fine
,
i
laughed
it
off
lol
thank
you
for
your
concern
tho
,
appreciate
it
[sskarz]
just
looking
out
[prabipyakurel]
you
know
when
you
are
drinking
and
it
goes
down
the
wrong
pipe
yea
that
situation
[sskarz]
ohhhh
yeah
that
happens
too
often
to
me
too
lol
😂
well
not
too
often
but
often
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
when
people
choke
on
water
i
laugh
,
but
if
someone
is
actually
choking
it
will
traumatize
me
,
like
I
will
start
freaking
out
.
[sskarz]
please
tell
me
you
know
the
heimleich
maneuver
[prabipyakurel]
No
i
know
how
its
done
,
but
I
will
freeze
and
it
just
scares
me
when
I
see
those
situations
[sskarz]
if
you
don
'
t
it
would
be
useful
to
know
in
those
kinds
of
situations
oh
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
have
watched
how
to
do
it
,
just
would
never
do
it
because
I
will
just
freeze
do
you
know
?
[sskarz]
mhmmm
i
do
,
my
dad
taught
me
how
it
hasn
'
t
come
to
use
yet
but
someday
it
will
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
nice
,
yea
thats
pretty
helpful
to
know
[sskarz]
oh
um
completely
unrelated
topic
here
did
you
hear
about
how
india
landed
a
spacecraft
on
the
moon
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
omg
really
[sskarz]
they
'
re
the
4th
country
in
the
world
to
do
so
,
they
won
the
race
against
russia
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
wait
let
me
search
that
up
[sskarz]
russia
'
s
spacecraft
actually
failed
[prabipyakurel]
damn
i
thought
russia
would
be
far
ahead
but
india
wow
pretty
facinating
[sskarz]
yeah
its
as
big
moment
for
them
happy
to
see
some
brown
representation
on
the
moon
its
actually
unfortunate
for
what
happened
to
their
spacecraft
like
it
was
heading
towards
the
moon
,
but
something
went
awry
[prabipyakurel]
yea
true
tho
[sskarz]
and
the
entire
thing
just
got
destroyed
it
crashed
into
the
moon
[prabipyakurel]
yikes
but
like
they
are
russia
i
feel
like
will
try
again
[sskarz]
maybe
not
,
especially
because
of
how
the
war
with
ukraine
is
happening
,
their
space
agency
is
losing
even
more
funding
now
it
might
just
collapse
for
good
which
is
crazy
to
think
about
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
right
,
actually
that
might
be
correct
,
yea
the
war
is
like
messing
them
up
[sskarz]
yeah
and
their
economy
is
just
tanking
so
,
really
who
knows
what
'
s
going
to
happen
[prabipyakurel]
idk
about
their
future
,
they
messes
up
bad
[sskarz]
only
time
will
tell
lol
[prabipyakurel]
fr
[sskarz]
if
putin
dies
then
we
'
re
all
happy
😂
[prabipyakurel]
well
i
mean
he
has
a
family
but
it
will
be
better
for
the
world
yea
[sskarz]
well
he
did
kind
of
start
it
so
like
...
he
'
s
responsible
for
thousands
of
deaths
[prabipyakurel]
he
is
really
a
monster
I
wont
lie
,
and
I
hope
that
karma
comes
for
him
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
but
he
needs
to
suffer
,
lol
he
cant
just
die
[sskarz]
like
in
a
torture
chamber
would
be
pretty
good
maybe
rot
in
a
cell
[prabipyakurel]
Something
like
that

Me

your
riddle
[sskarz]
omg
i
forgot
about

💀
[prabipyakurel]
Forgot
about
it
because
of
the
dumb
math
professor
and
just
remembered
[sskarz]
damn
i
was
really
hoping
that
was
just
a
fever
dream
i
had
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
really
sent
that
[sskarz]
yep
that
i
did
.
what
'
re
you
thinking
about
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
Sanskar
I
am
going
to
be
very
honest
with
you
here
,
I
am
think
of
something
but
too
scared
to
tell
you
in
case
it
’
s
not
correct
.
[sskarz]
Oh
I
gotcha
Well
,
if
you
want
you
can
just
rip
it
and
see
how
it
goes
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
what
if
you
don
’
t
like
it
[sskarz]
hmmmm
I
mean
you
'
d
have
to
downright
insult
me
for
me
not
to
like
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Um
Wait
let
me
think
[sskarz]
Okay
okay
wait
I
don
'
t
think
you
should
say
it
Only
because
I
remember
saying
,
if
you
'
re
not
100
%
confident
,
then
maybe
don
'
t
say
it
And
I
can
see
that
you
'
re
really
scared
,
and
I
don
'
t
want
you
to
feel
forced
to
do
something
you
don
'
t
want
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
scared
but
I
just
want
to
know
You
are
not
pressuring
me
or
anything
dw
❤
️
[sskarz]
You
know
I
'
m
scared
you
might
know
the
right
answer
Let
me
flip
that
on
you
first
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
?
[sskarz]
Just
nerves
I
guess
I
acted
so
confident
yesterday
and
then
I
'
m
sitting
here
like
,
oh
shit
😂
I
'
m
not
going
back
on
any
of
the
words
I
have
said
to
you
I
mean
everything
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
you
were
evil
yesterday
😂
I
mean
everything
I
said
to
you
too
,
it
all
came
from
the
heart
❤
️
What
happened
,
your
confidence
was
through
the
roof
yesterday
?
[sskarz]
I
mean
it
wasn
'
t
like
through
the
roof
or
anything
like
that
,
I
just
had
soon
forgot
about
it
afterwards
,
and
I
just
got
reminded
haha
You
know
its
kind
of
a
big
deal
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
still
has
me
thinking
too
,
lol
I
have
been
going
back
to
our
conversations
to
see
what
I
missed
[sskarz]
Have
you
really
solved
the
entire
riddle
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
I
have
[sskarz]
I
'
m
just
,
scared
that
if
you
get
it
wrong
,
then
I
'
m
wrong
too
yk
?
I
'
m
so
dumb
for
making
this
all
so
cryptic
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
’
s
what
I
am
afraid
of
too
,
what
if
I
say
a
name
and
it
’
s
not
the
correct
one
for
you
[sskarz]
I
want
to
tell
you
but
I
don
'
t
know
if
its
the
right
time
That
'
s
what
I
'
m
afraid
of
[prabipyakurel]
Got
for
it
.
But
up
to
you
If
you
feel
comfortable
sharing
,
i
hope
I
am
not
forcing
you
[sskarz]
You
'
re
not
at
all
I
'
m
just
thinking
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
I
am
thinking
of
something
but
don
’
t
know
if
you
will
like
it
or
not
[sskarz]
Same
here
haha
Quite
the
predicament
we
have
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
jeopardy
music
for
sure
😂
[sskarz]
Well
,
I
feel
like
it
'
d
kind
of
sound
anti
-
climactic
if
I
just
texted
it
to
you
at
the
same
time
you
'
d
probably
be
annoyed
if
I
didn
'
t
say
anything
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
,
you
share
it
how
you
want
to
and
how
you
would
like
to
,
I
am
open
.
[sskarz]
I
would
like
to
say
it
face
to
face
but
that
'
s
not
possible
,
just
to
build
up
the
suspense
haha
[prabipyakurel]
That
really
isn
’
t
[sskarz]
Prabi
,
you
are
one
of
the
nicest
people
I
'
ve
ever
met
in
my
life
.
You
are
always
there
to
brighten
up
my
days
.
Even
when
I
can
be
too
honest
at
times
,
you
accepted
me
for
who
I
am
and
I
honestly
couldn
'
t
ask
for
any
better
.
You
truly
are
amazingier
😂
I

t
try
to
hide

I

anyone
.
You
'
re
the
only
one
I
could
tolerate
being
messed
with
all
day
and
everyday
,
and
it
'
s
because
I
love
talking
with
you
.
I
don
'
t
know
any
other
person
who
I
could
talk
to
hours
on
end
and
always
come
out
with
a
smile
.
You
'
re
beautiful
,
smart
as
all
hell
,
and
even
a
little
clumsy
but
it
just
cements
this
in
my
heart
more
.
Now
I
just
want
to
say
,
if
this
isn
'
t
what
you
thought
it
was
going
to
be
,
I
'
m
really
sorry
.
❤
️
All
I
ask
for
is
your
honesty
[prabipyakurel]
First
of
all
,
I
always
thought
you
were
cute
and
so
sweet
,
and
when
you
sent
that
poem
and
said
that
it
was
specifically
for
me
,
i
wanted
to
tell
you
I
liked
you
on
the
spot
,
but
lol
I
was
so
scared
to
tell
you
in
case
you
didn
’
t
think
that
way
about
me
.
No
like
I
like
you
a
lot
,
and
you
are
my
first
.
No
need
to
apologize
,
honestly
you
are
so
sweet
and
funny
and
smart
and
everything
.
Like
god
made
you
for
me
god
dammit
,
I
just
didn
’
t
want
to
share
yesterday
because
I
thought
that
only
I
had
feelings
for
you
,
but
I
am
glad
you
shared
.
You
are
amazinger
and
you
know
it
.
Ahhhhhhhh
,
thank
you
for
being
honest
with
me
.
❤
️
❤
️
The
way
I
feel
talking
to
you
is
unmatched
to
any
other
conversation
I
ever
have
,
and
lol
I
have
made
your
spelling
worse
the
more
we
talk
😂
but
overall
yes
I
like
you
a
lot
.
[sskarz]
Oh
my
I
'
m
so
relieved
right
now
,
you
have
no
idea
I
was
pacing
in
my
room
about
to
eat
my
own
hands
alive
.
I
'
m
so
glad
you
feel
the
same
way
,
I
really
wanted
to
tell
you
in
person
somehow
but
it
'
s
just
not
possible
and
I
done
did
the
mistake
of
going
too
far
yesterday
with
the
easy
riddle
to
solve
haha
.
But
I
'
m
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
glad
,
I
really
thought
I
was
the
only
one
holding
these
feelings
back
I
won
'
t
lie
😂
.
I
really
like
you
,
and
I
'
m
really
glad
that
you
like
me
too
❤
️
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nah
when
you
started
typing
I
had
to
go
back
down
from
my
bunk
bed
,
like
walk
around
and
panic
while
my
roommates
were
doing
their
nighttime
routine
in
the
restroom
.
Like
I
was
stressing
and
sweating
😂,
and
you
aren
’
t
the
only
one
holding
back
feelings
,
that
was
me
like
a
while
back
.
And
when
you
came
over
to
my
house
,
I
couldn
’
t
show
it
because
lol
everyone
was
there
,
but
I
just
wanted
to
hug
you
and
tell
you
that
you
were
the
cutest
person
.
😊
😂
❤
️
[sskarz]
OMG
if
I
didn
'
t
need
to
leave
so
early
,
I
really
wanted
to
talk
to
you
.
Like
when
you
came
and
said
goodbye
,
I
just
wanted
to
have
that
conversation
but
I
...
got
a
little
scared
I
won
'
t
lie
.
You
know
when
we
talk
it
all
seems
so
obvious
now
,
but
I
swear
to
you
I
thought
I
was
the
only
one
on
this
side
of
our
conversations
that
had
these
feelings
I
couldn
'
t
share
!
Really
,
I
would
'
ve
much
rather
told
you
in
person
but
I
just
missed
my
chance
,
so
forgive
me
for
telling
you
like
this
.
I
wanted
to
make
it
special
❤
️
I
feel
so
happy
right
now
I
could
literally
go
fly
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
fr
your
dad
was
saying
something
to
me
about
college
and
I
ran
to
the
door
to
say
bye
to
you
,
and
I
listened
to
him
again
after
😂
😂
[sskarz]
I
really
wish
I
just
could
'
ve
talked
to
you
for
a
bit
longer
before
I
left
,
but
hey
,
I
guess
it
still
works
out
:)
[prabipyakurel]
This
was
special
,
anytime
I
talk
to
you
is
special
honestly
,
I
am
glad
you
shared
today
,
like
is
gonna
be
really
nice
from
now
on
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
feels
like
a
heavy
thing
just
came
off
my
shoulders
haha
,
oh
my
god
I
'
m
like
in
shock
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanted
to
scream
it
out
the
door
,
you
don
’
t
even
know
and
no
need
to
apologize
.
[sskarz]
you
are
honestly
the
cutest
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
no
you
aren
’
t
alone
,
when
you
asked
me
have
I
found
someone
worthy
,
I
was
about
to
be
like
“
yea
you
”
but
I
got
scared
so
I
stuck
to
“
maybe
”
And
then
you
said
yes
so
I
wanted
to
confirm
if
it
was
me
or
not
.
[sskarz]
omg
that
scared
me
to
death
💀
when
you
said
maybe
,
my
heart
stopped
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
officially
the
cuter
one
❤
️
I
will
not
back
down
,
I
have
given
my
word
.
[sskarz]
well
this
might
be
our
first
argument
then
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Why
what
was
going
through
your
head
?
Yea
,
and
I
am
winning
[sskarz]
oh
so
so
so
many
things
were
going
on
that
'
s
why
I
tried
to
like
get
a
few
hints
out
from
you
to
even
try
and
see
if
its
like
,
me
honestly
I
wish
I
was
just
blunt
,
I
put
you
through
all
that
trouble
for
nothing
😭
Oh
!
you
know
what
,
how
did
you
put
the
riddle
together
?
and
how
long
did
it
take
to
solve
,
be
honest
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
long
,
imma
be
honest
,
I
read
it
once
and
was
like
mhm
okay
yea
i
know
who
this
is
for
The
last
sentence
Im
telling
you
Pinned
a
message
.
But
I
loved
the
poem
,
it
was
beautiful
,
thanks
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Hmmm
but
what
did
that
last
letter
mean
?
or
i
guess
the
last
line
did
you
know
what
I
was
referring
to
?
[prabipyakurel]
The
letter
that
spelled
YOU
[sskarz]
wait
wahhhhh
wait
wait
what
do
you
mean
hold
on
here
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Was
that
not
how
I
was
supposed
to
interpret
it
😂
You
explain
,
how
was
I
?
[sskarz]
Okay
so
let
me
just
copy
paste
it
here
so
I
can
remember
💀
[prabipyakurel]
To
the
waves
that
carry
A
sign
was
shown
A
place
unimaginable
And
unfathomable
There
in
their
eyes
they
witnessed
Witnessed
with
me
The
letter
that
spelled
thee
Here
go
[sskarz]
o
thank
u
❤
️
First
line
:
the
key
word
was
'
waves
',
like
the
ocean
waves
Second
line
:
a
'
sign
'
was
referring
to
the
letter
Third
and
fourth
line
:
i
'
m
ngl
i
just
put
this
out
there
to
try
and
confuse
you
😂
Fifth
and
sixth
line
:
I
was
referencing
when
we
were
playing
battleships
,
the
last
match
before
I
had
to
leave
,
when
we
revealed
both
of
our
fleets
,
and
mine
was
in
a
special
shape
Last
line
:
The
letter
was
a
P
,
and
it
stood
for
Prabi
,
you
:)
It
'
s
why
I
said
I
wanted
to
test
your
memory
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Wait

battle
ship
letter
was
a
p
?
💀
[sskarz]

the
ships
in
the
shape
of
a
P

was
focusing
on
during
that
time
was
to

speak
up
😂
[sskarz]
I

😂
and

pressuring
me
😭
i
was
just

nepali

times
I

to
reread
your
text
(

1st

I

said
something
else
😂

hahahaha
😂
i

the
spelling
error
lolol
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
said
your
name
,
but
the
whole
reason
I
wanted
to
hear
your
first
was
to
see
if
you
liked
me
,
imagine
you
didn
’
t
and
I
was
like
“
oh
I
solved
the
riddle
,
it
is
me
.”
[sskarz]
oh
my
oh
my
,
im
so
sorry
other
realities
but
im
so
glad
im
living
in
this
one
right
now
[prabipyakurel]
Me
too
,
ahhh
the
best
night
of
my
life
❤
️
[sskarz]
but
hey
I
want
to
tell
you
something
.
When
we
do
meet
again
,
we
can
start
slow
I
still
want
to
have
experience
going
out
with
you
and
bringing
you
to
roller
coaster
rides
and
thrilling
stuff
you
know
?
[prabipyakurel]
We
will
start
slow
,
also
I
don
’
t
think
I
am
allowed
to
date
,
and
I
understand
if
that
is
the
deal
breaker
but
I
can
’
t
let
my
family
know
about
this
until
like
we
are
both
successful
and
everything
.
Can
we
keep
this
a
secret
?
👍
I
would
love
to
do
that
❤
️
❤
️
[sskarz]
That
'
s
fine
by
me
!
No
worries
,
I
know
that
struggle
.
Completely
good
👌
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
told
anyone
?
[sskarz]
about
you
and
I
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
not
a
soul
not
even
my
sister
and
I
'
ll
keep
it
that
way
[prabipyakurel]
Cool
,
thank
you
for
understanding
,
like
my
parents
would
love
you
,
you
are
so
amazing
,
but
I
think
we
got
to
reach
our
goals
and
be
of
age
,
then
we
can
slowly
you
know
let
people
know
.
👍
Are
you
allowed
to
date
?
[sskarz]
Um
...
you
know
I
'
m
not
so
sure
myself
😂
I
get
like
super
mixed
signals
from
my
parents
and
everyone
,
I
'
ve
got
no
clue
Some
days
they
'
ll
be
like
,
omg
sanskar
you
have
to
find
someone
otherwise
you
'
re
gonna
die
alone
!
or
some
days
they
'
ll
be
like
,
you
need
to
focus
on
your
studies
and
worry
about
that
stuff
later
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
lol
,
oooo
the
stare
my
family
would
give
me
if
they
knew
about
this
conversation
,
nah
uh
😂
[sskarz]
but
if
I
'
m
honest
,
if
I
ever
let
them
know
,
I
don
'
t
think
they
'
d
be
opposed
to
it
at
all
,
they
really
liked
the
idea
of
you
being
with
me
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
when
did
they
say
that
?
[sskarz]
omg
since
forever
I
have
this
really
funny
story
😂
so
it
was
like
right
after
a
party
that
we
both
went
to
and
then
my
family
and
I
left
and
so
I
was
driving
in
the
night
listening
to
some
music
and
everyone
was
dead
silent
then
my
dad
speaks
up
and
he
just
says
,
you
know
she
'
s
right
for
you
and
I
have
to
pretend
like
,
who
?
and
he
straight
up
says
,
Prabi
,
why
aren
'
t
you
making
any
moves
?
the
**
bombastic
side
eye
**
I
gave
him
in
that
ride
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
lol
,
destined
I
guess
.
❤
️
The
bombastic
side
eye
tho
Was
this
that
one
party
where
your
dad

a
song

thinking
of
the
wrong
party
or
something
[sskarz]
maybe
?
idk
he
sings
a
lot
on
a
lot
of
occassions
your

Hey
hey
,
hope
I
’
m
not
disturbing
you
how
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
not
at
all
,
you
are
never
disturbing
me
.
My
day
was
pretty
busy
,
I
had
the
other
4
classes
today
and
I
MADE
FRIENDS
.
I
loved
my
sociology
class
,
it
was
very
active
and
discussion
based
.
Then
I
went
to
my
english
philosophy
class
which
was
pretty
fun
,
the
teacher
was
awesome
.
After
that
I
hurried
back
to
get
some
lunch
after
like
12
to
around
1
,
then
left
to
my
discussions
from
4
to
5
o
clock
and
then
ran
all
the
way
across
campus
to
go
to
my
history
class
fom
5
to
6
.
After
that
i
came
back
,
said
bye
to
one
roommate
and
then
went
to
eat
dinner
and
said
bye
to
my
other
roommate
.
Now
I
am
alone
and
have
no
one
to
talk
to
,
sorry
for
getting
back
late
,
was
having
a
little
convo
with
my
mom
.
❤
️
How
about
you
,
did
you
share
some
of
your
wisdom
to
the
underclassmen
?
[sskarz]
seeeeeeee
I
told
you
'
d
make
friends
,
and
you
were
doubting
smh
haha
,
In
all
seriousness
tho
,
sounds
like
you
had
an
amazing
day
!
See
,
college
can
be
real
fun
when
you
get
these
experiences
.
Oh
and
no
worries
,
you
don
'
t
need
to
say
sorry
ever
lol
❤
️
Yeah
today
'
s
been
a
day
lol
,
I
'
ve
been
working
for
like
12
hours
straight
and
I
just
got
to
sit
down
and
relax
.
So
I
started
my
day
at
around
6
am
and
headed
to
the
gym
,
then
back
home
,
showered
,
then
arrived
at
campus
at
8
.
I
organized
a
team
yesterday
to
setup
this
tabling
event
you
saw
from
my
instagram
post
,
so
we
set
that
up
and
it
took
us
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
get
materials
and
setup
.
Then
I
had
to
present
to
a
lecture
hall
of
100
students
about
our
club
and
I
had
to
do
that
by
myself
because
my
partner
forgot
about
it
lol
.
After
that
,
I
went
and
sat
around
my
club
booth
for
about
2
hours
and
helped
people
sign
up
and
told
them
about
our
club
.
And
then
I
had
another
class
presentation
in
my
actual
class
,
and
after
my
class
was
over
,
I
headed
to
the
library
to
get
the
work
done
from
that
class
.
It
was
like
4pm
at
this
point
,
so
I
headed
to
Sam
'
s
Club
and
grabbed
some
workout
protein
stuff
because
I
was
running
out
,
and
that
was
busy
so
it
took
me
till
5
:
30
to
come
back
home
.
Once
I
was
back
home
,
I
fed
the
dog
and
then
worked
on
my
Saturday
curriculuum
for
my
students
and
then
had
some
server
work
to
do
.
And
then
my
mom
made
really
good
food
,
but
I
was
already
over
like
my
diet
stuff
,
so
then
after
dinner
,
like
at
around
6
:
30
,
I
went
for
a
5
mile
run
.
I
'
m
really
proud
of
this
one
because
I
actually
ran
it
without
ever
stopping
,
just
ran
and
jogged
the
entire
thing
through
which
was
crazy
.
And
then
I
just
came
back
home
from
that
,
showered
,
and
I
'
m
like
dead
as
all
hell
😂
it
has
been
a
**
day
**
[prabipyakurel]
im
not
ignoring
,
im
reading
,
give
me
a
min
lol
[sskarz]
haha
no
worries
no
worries
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhh
damn
,
and
i
thought
my
little
walk
around
the
campus
was
a
lot
.
Good
Job
though
,
proud
of
you
.
5
miles
is
a
lottttttt
.
Glad
the
club
went
well
and
the
fact
that
you
lectured
to
100
students
is
wild
.
You
have
had
a
day
.
Do
you
just
listen
to
music
and
think
about
nothing
when
you
run
?
Take
care
though
,
make
sure
you
rest
,
you
know
drink
tea
if
needed
and
cool
yourself
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Yeah
usually
I
put
on
my
motivational
gym
music
when
I
'
m
running
and
pretend
I
'
m
David
Goggins
😂
Mhmmm
I
just
drank
a
straight
gallon
of
water
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
i
mean
thats
one
way
to
keep
going
.
But
thats
good
,
i
got
little
legs
lol
,
they
get
tired
so
easily
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
was
good
,
I
'
ve
never
done
that
and
now
that
'
s
a
milestone
broken
[prabipyakurel]
I
filled
up
half
a
gallon
yesterday
and
I
am
still
not
done
with
it
😎
❤
️
[sskarz]

prabi
[prabipyakurel]
Well

good
things

to
the
list
.
[sskarz]
yup
yup
👍
and
tomorrow
,
its
gonna
be
a
chill
day
so
its
all
worth
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
just
have
math
tomorrow
,
which
scares
the
shit
out
of
me
more
than
my
upper
division
classes
.
Im
fr
still
scared
of
the
class
and
professor
both
,
hopefully
tomorrow
he
starts
off
slow
.
[sskarz]
I
know
you
got
this
,
just
keep
a
level
head
and
focus
up
and
it
'
ll
work
out
okay
I
know
that
sounds
a
lot
easier
than
it
is
to
do
but
trust
me
that
'
s
just
how
it
be
😂
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
trying
,
lol
i
am
walking
there
with
no
previous
calc
knowledge
,
and
everyone
i
meet
in
there
is
like
oh
wow
,
nice
to
meet
you
,
which
calc
class
did
you
take
in
high
school
?
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
i
just
want
to
like
you
know
[sskarz]
okay
okay
question
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
I
am
not
going
to
stop
trying
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
do
you
know
sin
cos
tan
and
the
relationships
between
them
?
that
'
s
my
girl
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Like
slightly
,
might
need
to
review
Awwww
thats
a
first
.
[sskarz]
testing
the
waters
haha
well
i
'
m
ngl
,
i
used
khan
academy
like
crazy
when
I
was
going
through
my
calc
classes
in
high
school
they
explain
the
concepts
pretty
well
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
still
using
that
,
I
taught
myself
a
little
about
limits
and
how
they
work
using
khan
academy
like
during
the
summer
[sskarz]
good
good
!
limits
is
the
first
concept
you
learn
about
from
there
you
'
ll
transition
to
derivatives
,
and
from
there
to
anti
-
derivatives
aka
integrals
👍
how
did
you
feel
about
limits
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
I
got
the
basics
down
,
and
if
he
went
on
from
there
,
i
should
be
able
to
pick
it
up
.
[sskarz]
then
you
'
re
golden
honestly
if
you
'
re
worried
,
what
you
can
do
is
keep
ahead
in
the
khan
academy
lessons
comparatively
to
his
lessons
,
and
it
'
ll
help
you
call
back
concepts
easier
and
with
a
lot
more
understanding
I
wouldn
'
t
say
study
the
entire
course
catalog
in
a
single
day
,
but
be
a
couple
lessons
ahead
so
you
know
what
to
expect
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
omg
i
was
literally
thinking
of
doing
that
,
you
fr
reading
my
thoughts
rn
.
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
too
much
math
in
a
single
day
fries
my
brain
.
Right
,
like
the
time
when
you
sent
that
riddle
😂
[sskarz]
god
please
let
that
die
off
💀
i
just
cringe
thinking
about
it
now
😂
[prabipyakurel]
nah
that
is
the
most
adorable
and
beautiful
thing
,
im
taking
that
with
me
to
my
grave
[sskarz]
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
i
need
like
memory
wiping
technology
to
come
quicker
haha
😂
at
least
from
my
own
memory
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
really
cute
,
lol
it
wasnt
cringy
at
all
.
[sskarz]
right
it
was
cute
to
you
,
and
i
thought
i
was
like
gigabrain
when
i
typed
that
out
😂
but
as
soon
as
i
forgot
about
it
and
then
remembered
it
back
,
i
'
m
just
like
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
No
i
read
it
and
I
am
like
,
wow
he
is
like
shakespeare
💀
That
thing
will
be
hung
up
you
know
when
I
am
going
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
[sskarz]
i
hope
every
single
wall
disintegrates
around
you
😂
😂
so
you
can
'
t
hang
that
anywhere
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
I
cannot
erase
that
from
my
memory
lol
,
it
will
still
be
up
there
tho
.
[sskarz]
its
okay
its
okay
,
i
just
need
a
little
bit
of
like
hypnosis
and
i
'
ll
be
good
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Fr

room
is
so
quiet
without
my
roommates
,
its
like
lonely
All
I
can

is
the
commotion

the
hallways
,
and
the
fan
in
the
room
[sskarz]

️

I
passed
out
right
after
ending
the
call
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood
morning
,
rise
and
shine
.
I
slept
right
after
I
ended
our
call
too
,
but
like
then
got
like
this
dream
that
spiders
were
everywhere
so
woke
up
in
shock
for
a
min
and
then
checked
everything
,
then
I
woke
up
straight
in
the
morning
.
Hope
your
sleep
was
peaceful
!
[sskarz]
Oh
my
god
you
were
out
here
fighting
your
actual
worst
nightmare
Yep
,
like
a
rock
[prabipyakurel]
No
like
I
specifically
remember
like
waking
up
at
2
:
30
and
just
like
looking
around
,
I
like
checked
my
blanket
my
walls
and
everything
,
then
after
like
15
min
of
worrying
,
I
randomly
passed
out
.
😂
[sskarz]
Thankfully
just
a
dream
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
,
you
were
really
tired
too
.
[sskarz]
That
spider
on
the
window
really
spooked
you
lol
Yeah
I
fell
asleep
as
I
ended
the
call
I
had
0
energy
left
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
happens
everytime
,
when
I
see
a
bug
or
spider
,
I
am
going
to
see
something
in
my
dream
,
I
already
know
it
.
[sskarz]
it
be
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
lol
slept
in
that
fetal
position
?
[sskarz]
Nah
I
slept
face
down
this
time
somehow
I
was
just
too
exhausted
to
move
And
then
I
woke
up
this
morning
and
my
knees
are
killing
me
lol
[prabipyakurel]
were
you
talking
to
me
faced
down
😂
[sskarz]
Well
more
like
to
the
side
but
then
I
just
put
my
face
in
the
pillow
and
💤
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
well
yea
feel
better
,
maybe
don
'
t
do
as
much
walking
or
running
today
.
Awww
thats
one
way
to
do
it
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
taking
a
chill
day
today
I
’
m
not
overworking
myself
like
yesterday
,
just
gonna
do
what
I
wanna
do
[prabipyakurel]
yea
rest
is
important
,
and
yesterday
was
a
crazy
day
for
you
,
lol
and
i
kept
you
up
for
too
long
yesterday
,
so
today

on
getting
your
leg
better
and
chill
.
[sskarz]
No
no
I
wanted
to
keep
talking
to
you
,
no
matter
how
late
it
got
lol
But
a
little
too
tired
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
hearing
your
voice
was
the
perfect
way
to
end
my
day
yesterday
too
.
❤
️
perhaps
[sskarz]
You
are
the
cutest
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Damn
she
had
that
on
lock
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
I
did
,
I
was
ready
.
😂
Well
you
probably
need
to
get
ready
for
the
day
and
take
a
shower
and
stuff
with
your
skin
care
products
😂
[sskarz]
Of
course
!
I
’
ll
talk
to
you
later
tonight
:)
Hope
your
math
professor
chills
out
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
talk
to
you
later
:
)
❤
️
Dude
fr
needs
to
.
😂
I
am
praying
.
[sskarz]
you
got
it
👍
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
👋
Hi
,
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
Hey
,
it
'
s
been
good
hbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
too
interesting
,
math
was
simple
and
he
scared
me
less
today
,
and
I
learned
that
there
has
been
a
Covid
outbreak
in
the
residence
halls
so
that
’
s
why
I
was
sick
the
past
few
days
probably
😂
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
yeah
I
guess
that
would
make
sense
,
you
were
coughing
after
all
👍
did
you
guys
do
limits
today
?
or
just
review
of
pre
-
calc
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
No
he
said
that
limits
is
actually
going
to
be
after
like
the
midterms
,
today
he
just
went
over
the
importance
of
exponents
and
their
rules
.
he
took
way
too
long
talking
about
the
logistics
of
the
class
that
he
had
only
10
minutes
at
the
end
for
whatever
he
wanted
to
teach
.
It
was
fairly
short
.
[sskarz]
oh
wow
exponents
?
i
guess
setting
up
for
derivatives
,
but
that
'
s
weird
,
i
'
ve
never
seen
calc
1
be
taught
with
limits
not
being
the
first
topic
lol
i
guess
it
makes
sense
because
connecting
limits
and
derivatives
is
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
thats
what
I
thought
too
,
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
get
started
with
pre
calc
stuff
and
then
move
on
.
Probably
,
I
am
just
waiting
for
this
one
to
be
over
because
it
is
a
part
of
another
one
that
I
will
have
to
take
next
semester
.
[sskarz]
you
have
another
math
course
after
this
?
is
it
calc
2
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
like
math
16B
,
and
the
one
I
am
taking
right
now
is
math
16A
Sort
of
like
a
part
B
of
a
class
Its
a
series
[sskarz]
ohhhh
huh
but
16A
lasts
an
entire
semester
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[sskarz]
oh
so
i
guess
it
includes
calc
2
probably
eh

personally
[sskarz]
yeah
its
one
of
those
foods
that

precision
to
be
made
are

now
or

feeling
that
[prabipyakurel]
No

it
[prabipyakurel]
but

?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they

old
But
like
when
we

down
,
we
got
to
use
the
stairs
unless
you
wannna
wait
10
minutes
for
the
elevator
to
land
on
out
floor
.
But
going
up
is
easier
,
we
scan
our
student
card
and
wait
for
it
to
open
.
[sskarz]
ohh
how
many
floors
does
your
dorm
have
?
if
it
takes
that
long
for
it
to
go
down
lol
[prabipyakurel]
8
i
think
yea
[sskarz]
that
includes
the
roof
?
or
just
like
dorm
space
[prabipyakurel]
just
dorms
[sskarz]
oh

on
the
roof
?
[prabipyakurel]

kinda
scared
that
I
will
accidentally
do
something
dumb
and
fall
below
[sskarz]
do
you
have
a
fear
of
heights
?
[prabipyakurel]
No

the
fear
of
heights
,
I
dont
mind

to
high
places
,

'
t

💀
idk
how
i
would
climb
out
of
that
one
[prabipyakurel]
Aside
from
your
dog
,
no
one
else
should
experience
that
My
laptop
broke
down
,
got
essay
due
soon
,
called
for
emergency
only
[sskarz]
but
like
when
i
think
about
it
,
my
parents
would
certainly
be
shocked
/
surprised
,
but
they
'
d
warm
up
to
the
idea
eventually
....
probably
😂
oh
fs
,
and
then
we
show
that
i
'
m
labeled
tech
support
😂
wait
that
'
s
actually
ingenious
[prabipyakurel]
lol
works
out
perfectly
Its
the
whole
reason
i
have
you
like
that
[sskarz]
my
dog
would
snitch
fr
he
'
d
do
anything
for
a
treat
or
a
bone
😂
[prabipyakurel]
he
be
like
dragging
your
phone
downstairs
and
uses
his
paws
to
open
up
the
call
history
[sskarz]
he
'
s
taken
my
phone
before
😭
[prabipyakurel]
oh
really
,
does
he
have
somebody
to
talk
to
too
?
[sskarz]
he
'
s
got
his
own
secret
admirer
he
'
ll
go
on
google
images
and
search
up
treats
and
stare
at
it
😂
[prabipyakurel]
He
seems
like
a
chill
dude
[sskarz]
i
love
it
when
he
barely
wakes
up
,
that
'
s
when
he
'
s
the
sweetest
and
wants
to
be
around
me
but
once
someone
disturbs
the
peace
,
its
over
he
'
s
bouncing
off
the
walls
at
that
point
and
there
'
s
no
stopping
him
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwww
,
lol

had
a
crush
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
that
was
like
in
6th
and
7th
grade
,
and
he
was
mean
,
he
was
just
kinda
cute
,
thats
it
trust
me
i
lost
feelings
for
him
easily
[sskarz]
oh
trust
me
i
have
no
insecurities
based
off
your
passed
romantic
interests
,
that
wasn
'
t
my
intention
i
was
just
curious
that
'
s
all
:)
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
its
alright
,
lol
,
and
letting
you
know
that
your
past
relationships
were
in
the
past
and
I
have
nothing
against
those
and
will
never
.
trust
me
they
were
not
romantic
,
one
day
he
would
be
cute
and
the
other
days
,
I
wanted
to
flush
his
head
down
the
toilet
situation
so
😂
[sskarz]
dang
,
you
didn
'
t
like
anyone
during
high
school
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
no
one
in
high
school
there
were
faces
,
but
i
was
never
into
anyone
[sskarz]
no
no
i
trust
you
,
and
coming
from
me
,
all
of
that
past
stuff
doesn
'
t
bother
me
at
all
❤
️
life
happens
[prabipyakurel]
it
really
does
just
happen
[sskarz]
wow
so
everyone
was
just
that
terrible
?
😂
oh

if
you
ever
want
to
know
anything
from
my
past
,
you
just
ask
away
,
I
'
m
an
open
book
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
i
was
really
focused
on
studies
and
classes
,
I
knew
a
loooot
of
people
and
they
were
all
nice
,
but
never
had
feelings
for
any
mhm
for
sure
,
you
had
crushes
?
[sskarz]
naturally
I
did
mhmmm
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
[sskarz]
alot
of
them
were
like
,
i
'
d
like
them
for
their
looks
,
but
then
their
personality
would
just
be
ugly
[prabipyakurel]
No
some
are
like
that
[sskarz]
and
personality
and
values
are
a
big
thing
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
looks
can
be
deceiving
sometimes
Me
too
,
I
like
to
connect
to
people
from
the
inside
,
if
they
dont
got
that
and
they
are
just
like
outside
good
,
then
I
am
out
[sskarz]
yeah
same
even
if
someone
'
s
looks
were
10
/
10
,
if
they
had
a
shit
personality
,
i
'
d
never
want
them
[prabipyakurel]

🤞
[prabipyakurel]
I

dumb
math
professor

to
assign
anything
too
big
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
do
the
assignment
for

,
so

'
t
you
worry
hahaha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanna
see
you
,
like
omg
whenever
I
would
see
you
anywhere
,
I
would
get
like
butterflies
in
my
stomach
and
would
feel
so
excited
[sskarz]
SAME
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
that
was
only
me
for
a
while
[sskarz]
i
be
shaking
in
my
shoes
😂
no
no
you
'
ve
got
no
idea
i
was
the
same
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
after
the
first
time
I
saw
you
at
your
house
,
everytime
after
that
,
if
I
saw
you
anywhere
,
I
would
just
be
doing
anything
to
like
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
or
stay
a
bit
longer
.
[sskarz]
me
too
😭
still
thinking
about
the
last
time
i
saw
you
,
if
only
i
didn
'
t
have
to
go
so
early
[prabipyakurel]
no
i
am
replaying
that
in
my
head
wishing
I
had
said
something
other
than
just
bye
at
the
door
[sskarz]
omg
you
know
what
kind
of
ticked
me
off
that
day
?
when
i
left
and
went
to
go
pickup
the
person
,
they
got
stuck
in
traffic
for
40
mins
more
😭
so
i
could
'
ve
just
stayed
instead
of
leaving
so
earlyyyyyyyyyyy
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhhhh
,
lol
you
could
have
spent
that
40
min
with
me
[sskarz]
frrrrr
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
at
my
house
since
we
didnt
know
about
this
then
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
all
good
though
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
you
showed
me
the
vinyls
and
how
to
use
them
,
you
liked
me
then
too
?
[sskarz]
we
'
ll
have
our
chance
soon
[prabipyakurel]
oh
dw
,
i
am
sure
we
will
[sskarz]
mhmmm
and
i
had
no
idea
what
to
talk
about
so
i
just
thought
about
it
on
the
spot
and
i
guess
i
got
a
little
too
into
it
😂
but
i
was
a
nervous
wreck
inside
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
and
then
you
sang
and
took
out
everything
to
show
me
,
I
appreciated
that
Lovely
And
then
my
brother
was
there
asking
the
dumbest
questions
[sskarz]
😂
yeah
I
wanted
to
show
you
the
things
I
enjoy
in
hopes
it
would
create
conversation
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
did
,
i
called
that
thing
a
briefcase
before
I
knew
what
it
was
so
[sskarz]
hahaha
I
remember
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
started
a
conversation
,
i
was
so
dumb
[sskarz]
well
hey
now
you
know
how
to
use
a
vinyl
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
and
now
i
understand
why
when
your
sister
and
alish
were
going
to
mc
donalds
,
you
stayed
behind
i
thought
you
would
have
gone
with
them
,
i
was
ready
to
go
sit
with
aunties
[sskarz]
i
really
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
just
talk
to
you
it
was
when
we
were
playing
card
games
and
you
joined
in
,
and
then
they
said
they
wanted
to
get
food
but
i
really
didn
'
t
,
i
thought
i
'
d
miss
my
chance
[prabipyakurel]
That
was
another
one
of
those
nights
to
remember
we
talked
a
little
bit
outside
before
i
left
tho
when
you
know
a
bunch
of
boys
were
singing
and
stuff
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
i
remember
like
it
was
yesterday
just
watching
them
from
the
outside
with
you
i
slept
with
a
smile
on
my
face
i
swear
haha
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
left
smiling
and
continued
smiling
on
my
way
home
to
bed
I
remember
you
dropped
like
a
knife
or
something
and
broke
it
too
Yea
,
that
was
quite
funny
[sskarz]
omg
yes
the
cake
knife
😂
i
was
panicking
haha
[prabipyakurel]
You
looked
at
your
mom
and
went
"
it
broke
"
😂
[sskarz]
i
know
how
to
keep
a
calm
face
but
be
freaking
out
inside
pretty
well
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
like
I
remember
every
interaction
I
have
had
with
you
there
was
always
something
about
them
and
from
then
I
would
always
be
like
,
just
imagine
if
we
ever
started
talking
and
came
this
far
my
wishing
are
coming
true
little
by
little
[sskarz]
omg
same
wtf
we
'
re
the
same
everytime
i
heard
you
were
gonna
attend
some
event
or
something
,
i
made
sure
i
could
go
too
and
my
parents
were
surprised
to
see
me
be
so
eager
at
times
haha
[prabipyakurel]
No
trust
me
,
i
would
not
know
if
you
were
attending
but
if
your
parents
were
,
there
was
a
chance
,
so
i
would
go
😂
[sskarz]
oh
and
for
the
record
,
my
parents
would
talk
about
you
a
lot
when
we
used
to
meet
somewhat
more
regularly
,
and
i
'
d
just
have
to
pretend
that
it
was
nothing
😂
❤
️
couldn
'
t
let
it
show
yk
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
when
you
left
from
my
house
both
times
,
my
mom
would
start
the
convo
and
be
like
,
he
is
so
sweet
and
caring
and
nice
,
and
my
dad
would
nod
his
head
.
That
was
a
pretty
good
sign
My
brother
would
give
me
those
eyebrows
looks
and
I
would
just
pretend
that
that
i
totally
didnt
have
a
crush
on
you
😂
[sskarz]
your
brother
is
hilarious
hahaha
honestly
such
a
funny
dude
[prabipyakurel]
That
one
fr
be
saying
the
wrong
things
at
the
wrong
time
[sskarz]
and
then
seeing
you
be
mad
at
him
it
just
made
me
smile
everytime
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
,
funny
is
not
the
only
word
used
to
describe
him
😂
[sskarz]
the
way
you
'
d
snap
at
him
if
he
even
breathed
the
wrong
way
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
thats
because
when
we
were
playing
card
in
your
sisters
room
,
everyone
would
be
sitting
normally
and
he
be
laying
down
and
saying
the
weirdest
things
in
front
of
you
,
oh
if
looks
could
kill
😂
[sskarz]
It
was
honestly
very
wholesome
when
I
saw
you
and
your
brother
interact
with
each
other
❤
️
I
could
just
tell
how
much
you
care
about
him
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
jokes
aside
I
love
him
and
want
to
see
him
be
anything
he
desires
to
be
.
❤
️
I
am
sure
your
sister
is
like
that
too
,
lol
you
fight
but
you
need
each
other
.
universal
sibling
thing
👍
[sskarz]
oh
we
don
'
t
"
fight
"
we
just
mess
with
each
other
often
haha
,
but
yeah
I
love
her
she
'
s
helped
me
in
my
lowest
and
been
there
for
me
when
no
one
else
was
❤
️
I
couldn
'
t
ever
repay
her
for
what
she
did
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
So
sweet
,
she
is
lucky
to
have
someone
like
you
too
.
[sskarz]
and
my
god
am
i
lucky
to
have
her
as
my
sister
seriously
,
if
it
wasn
'
t
for
her
,
i
seriously
don
'
t
know
who
i
'
d
be
someone
worse
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
she
is
really
sweet
and
caring
and
knows
how
to
calm
people
down
,
i
remember
when
I
got
waitlisted
from
UCLA
,
I
called
her
and
she
made
me
feel
okay
and
I
stopped
stressing
.
I
would
have
panicked
and
done
something
if
she
didnt
say
some
of
those
uplifting
things
to
me
.
She
is
amazing
and
the
prettiest
person
I
know
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
fr
she
'
s
the
goat
greatest
of
all
time
[prabipyakurel]
i
know
that
lol
[sskarz]
if
you
didn
'
t
know
,
not
an
actual
goat
💀
ok
ok
good
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
dont
worry
been
there
,
brother
called
me
dumb
and
explained
it
over
the
summer
😂
[sskarz]
ahhh
yeah
its
hard
to
keep
up
with
all
these
new
terms
and
stuff
like
sometimes
i
be
reading
twitter
and
like
a
7
word
acronym
comes
out
of
nowhere
and
im
like
what
😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Sme
people
shorten
up
long
phrases
and
it
gets
confusing
[sskarz]
yea
at
that
point
just
say
the
phrase
lol
[prabipyakurel]
people
literally
save
those
extra
3
seconds
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]
I

them
from

if

[sskarz]

but
i

actively
choose
it
on
anything
same

[prabipyakurel]
Well
[sskarz]
if
its
there

it
[prabipyakurel]
Pickles
are
actually
pretty
good
[sskarz]
yeah
they
'
re
not
bad
imo
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
them
on
like
sandwiches
or
pizza
both
Not
the
best
thing
,
but
its
good
[sskarz]
on
the
higher
tier
of
vegetables
in
sandwiches
or
on
pizza
hey
hey
you
can
like
pickles
,
no
need
to
defend
😂
😂
i

like
you

lot
,
even
through
all
the
pickles
😂
[prabipyakurel]

you
I
need
to
hug
you
rn
[sskarz]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
im

shorter
one
💀
💀
[sskarz]
if
you
do
come
on
saturday
,
its
gonna
be
real
difficult
for
me
to
pretend
we
'
re
just
friends
and
not
just
hug
you
instantly
haha
❤
️
i
'
ll
keep
a
level
head
but
damn
will
it
be
difficult
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
ik
,
we
gonna
have
that
stare
and
it
will
be
really
hard
for
me
not
to
just
go
to
you
running
and
get
a
hug
I
will
try
sitting
with
or
near
you
though
,
if
possible
❤
️
[sskarz]
awwwwww
you
'
re
the
cutest
i
was
gonna
say
,
i
need
to
make
a
cover
story
to
fall
back
on
😂
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
ok
ok
so
like
if
i
see
you
im
gonna
ask
all
about
your
uni
stuff
like
i
don
'
t
already
know
💀
[prabipyakurel]
right
yes
start
with
the
basics
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
and
then
like
i
'
ll
ask
about
your
dorm
life
and
if
that
'
s
not
convincing
enough
to
everyone
else
,
idk
what
is
because
i
know
for
a
fact
my
famliy
is
gonna
be
watching
me
lol
[prabipyakurel]
for
sure
,
i
will
be
asking
how
life
is
going
Nah
they
probably
wont
they
will
do
their
own
thing
no
[sskarz]
oh
you
'
d
be
surprised
,
my
dad
and
cousin
Abhigya
always
tease
me
about
you
everytime
😂
and
I
always
have
to
shut
them
down
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
your
cousin
was
with
you
upstairs
in
my
room
when
we
were
playing
battleship
that
is
probably
why
he
was
teasing
you
about
speaking
nepali
it
makes
sense
now
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
,
he
came
upstairs
to
see
how
we
were
both
getting
along
[prabipyakurel]
he
kept
giving
you
that
stare
[sskarz]
he
'
s
so
interested
in
relationships
or
anything
potential
like
that
like
if
he
got
my
phone
for
a
second
,
he
'
d
search
everything
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
adorable
tho
,
i
would
have
not
expected
your
dad
to
be
like
that
,
I
expected
him
to
be
like
,
no
,
no
you
dont
do
those
things
😂
[sskarz]
which
is
why
i
stay
very
cautious
when
im
around
him
with
that
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
damn
[sskarz]
you
don
'
t
understand
,
he
thinks
im
gonna
die
alone
if
i
don
'
t
find
someone
within
the
next
2
years
😭
little
does
he
know
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
so
funny
He
is
a
very
funny
person
yk
,
when
you
were
teaching
me
some
card
game
the
time
we
came
to
your
house
,
he
kept
on
passing
by
and
going
"
thats
right
"
or
"
i
taught
him
"
😂
and
it
was
just
hilarious
your
face
was
like
nah
uh
,
you
didnt
[sskarz]
yeah
he
'
s
basically
my
older
brother
,
he
lived
with
me
for
years
so
some
stuff
,
i
won
'
t
lie
,
he
did
teach
me
haha
but
hey
i
learned
that
stuff
on
my
own
,
that
was
true
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
and
thats
good
to
have
him
around
sometimes
you
know
,
he
will
just
keep
putting
you
in
awkward
situations
[sskarz]
he
'
ll
keep
me
in
check
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
But
at
the
party
saturday
,
I
doubt
anyone
will
really
focus
on
you
and
me
maybe
my
parents
,
havent
seen
them
in
a
while
,
but
other
than
that
,
i
think
we
got
this
❤
️
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
find
a
way
to
hug
you
without
anyone
seeing
us
haha
❤
️
that
'
s
on
my
bucket
list
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
if
you
don
'
t
I
will
find
a
way
❤
️
if
that
means
I
bump
into
you
and
apologize
so
be
it
[sskarz]
hahaha
we
'
ll
figure
it
out
together
i
'
ll
message
you
under
the
table
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
already
know
[sskarz]
honestly
its
the
biggest
thing
im
looking
forward
to
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
really
dont
want
to
miss
coming
to
LA
not
because
I
get
to
wear
this
new
dress
that
I
got
that
is
the
prettiest
,
but
also
you
❤
️
So
2
more
good
reasons
[sskarz]
omg
I
get
to
see
you
in
a
new
dress
?
You
were
already
stunning
haha
you
got
me
even
more
hyped
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
STOPPP
you
are
so
cuteeeeeee
,
lol
its
a
pretty
dress
,
you
will
see
when
time
comes
❤
️
if
that
time
comes
of
course
[sskarz]
manifesting
that
it
does
i
'
ll
manifest
it
everyday
so
it
happens
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
you
first
[prabipyakurel]
But
hey
I
know
that
we
wont
see
each
other
often
and
that
we
are
far
away
from
each
other
,
and
I
hope
that
this
long
distance
thing
works
for
us
.
I
know
its
a
little
hard
and
you
might
not
want
it
to
be
this
way
but
let
me
know
if
you
ever
feel
like
its
a
little
difficult
.
But
no
matter
how
far
we
are
,
always
know
that
I
will
love
you
,
support
you
,
and
be
with
you
,
no
matter
the
distance
.
I
just
wanted
to
tell
you

[sskarz]
Hey
hey
,
long
distance
is
not
a
big
thing
for
me
.
I
mean
of
course
I
miss
you
,
but
just
talking
to
you
everyday
like
this
or
calling
,
it
helps
a
lot
and
I
know
when
I
get
to
see
you
again
,
I
won
'
t
be
worrying
about
anything
.
I
'

human
being

emotions

I
want
to
be
with
you
.
❤

be
even
better
as

get
to
know
each
other
more

I

[sskarz]

the
sweet
side

spider

fabreeze

the
spot

we

run
away
from

together
❤
️
[sskarz]

jump
out
of
my
stomps
and
it
scares
the
shit
out
of
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol

,
in
that
case
we
will
just
both
avoid
it

the
best
case
lol

got
that
flamethrower
for
such
situations

😂

fine
[sskarz]
yeah
true
true
[prabipyakurel]
Like
my
room
is
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hallway
so
the
window
from
the
person
in
front
of
my
room
can
hear
it
clearly
I
went
to
the
lobby
to
take
a
video
for
you
[sskarz]
that
'
s
from
the
lobby
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
why
does
it
look
so
high
up
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Like
a
communal
room
No
there
is
one
on
every
floor
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
Like
a
study
area
And
the
balcony
is
not
the
safest
so
I
just
took
it
from
inside
No
one
is
asleep
,
I
walked
past
5
dorm
doors
that
were
wide
open
[sskarz]
ah
i
gotcha
im
ngl
,
a
part
of
me
wants
to
have
that
dorm
experience
but
at
the
same
time
,
i
just
love
my
home
and
i
think
i
'
d
get
sick
of
the
dorm
experience
quick
lol
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
you
came
to
berkeley
with
me
,
not
roommates
but
we
could
have
stayed
on
the
same
floor
possibly
[sskarz]
if
onlyyy
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
,
home
is
better
though
,
dorm
is
just
an
experience
,
its
not
like
everyone
here
is
fully
happy
unless
they
live
nearby
then
yea
[sskarz]
yeah
true
like
i
'
d
miss
my
room
the
most
my
entire
setup
and
everything
i
remember
being
in
Nepal
and
being
there
for
a
month
,
2
weeks
in
i
was
really
homesick
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
,
I
feel
like
you
have
everything
,
your
classes
and
stuff
back
home
,
so
you
gonna
miss
your
room
for
sure
[sskarz]
well
actually
my
family
,
then
bear
,
then
my
room
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
I
really
was
too
,
and
I
was
born
there
,
it
was
fun
but
like
I
got
so
used
to
the
lifestyle
here
that
I
cant
function
too
many
days
without
compromising
on
something
over
there
.
Yea
family
for
sure
Like
its
been
a
week
and
when
I
talk
to
them
it
feels
sooo
good
,
or
talking
to
anyone
in
general
.
It
felt
like
home
when
I
talked
to
you
yesterday
too
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
awwwww
you
are
honestly
just
.......
UGH
get
over
here
already
❤
️
😂
*
no
you
didn
'
t
see
that
*
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
joy
[sskarz]
LOL
so
something
about
discord
,
if
you
type
":
joy
:"
but
remove
that
space
between
the
y
and
the
colon
,
it
makes
that
emoji
[prabipyakurel]
I
wish
I
could
just
teleport
sometimes
yk
[sskarz]
i
just
mistyped
the
way
i
would
'
ve
teleported
to
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont
think
i
can
stop
my
self
from
running
into
you
and
hugging
you
saturday
[sskarz]
you
must
!
till
we
'
re
alone
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
going
to
take
a
lot
of
self
control
[sskarz]
remember
we
are
just
some
good
friends
haha
i
knowwwwww
its
gonna
pain
me
to
talk
to
you
like
we
were
friends
that
haven
'
t
talked
since
then
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
we
are
somewhat
strangers
that
totally
dont
like
each
other
and
talk
to
each
other
everyday
😂
Imagine
sitting
across
the
table
like
how
we
sat
at
that
one
party
and
screaming
,
so
how
has
life
been
?
[sskarz]
OMG
💀
ok
ok
funny
you
bring
that
up
i
remember
that
party
where
we
sat
across
from
each
other
and
i
remember
so
specifically
that
i
kept
sneaking
glances
at
you
,
and
then
i
saw
you
do
the
same
and
i
was
like
woah
did
i
just
see
that
?
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
omg
noooooo
i
thought
I
was
seeing
things
[sskarz]
i
wanted
to
sit
next
to
you
but
the
table
was
full
😂
[prabipyakurel]
no
,
i
wanted
to
tell
bijesh
to
get
the
hell
out
of
there
[sskarz]
LMAO
[prabipyakurel]
and
sit
somewhere
else
[sskarz]
hahaha
poor
bijesh
[prabipyakurel]
no
nothing
against
the
dude
,
but
I
was
like
,
just
if
that
place
was
empty
,
I
would
like
spill
a
drink
in
that
area
so
I
could
go
sit
over
there
.
😂
[sskarz]
you
'
re
unbelievably
adorable
,
seriously
i
don
'
t
deserve
you
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
so
adorable
tho
,
omg
you
were
looking
at
me
like
that
?
[sskarz]
yeahhhhhh
,
and
i
thought
i
was
creeping
you
out
so
i
legit
just
started
talking
to
bijesh
so
i
could
distract
myself
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
trust
me
,
I
never
thought
in
a
million
years
that
you
would
like
me
out
of
all
people
.
And
here
I
thought
you
just
didnt
wanna
look
at
me
so
you
were
talking
to
everyone
else
[sskarz]
no
no
,
I
thought
I
saw
you
seeing
me
give
you
glances
,
and
I
was
scared
of
appearing
like
I
was
creeping
you
out
or
something
like
that
you
literally
tick
all
of
my
boxes
in
what
I
want
for
a
partner
every
single
one
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
no
i
didnt
notice
,
but
I
kept
looking
back
even
when
people
were
performing
on
stage
,
so
i
could
see
you
smile
❤
️
Ahhhhhhhhhh
you
are
so
amazing
i
swear
,

checked
off
all
that
I
needed
on
my
end

Thats

t
be
able

time
so
yk

❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
stay
away
from
the
phone
and
me
when
you
are
home
especially
when
you
around
a
lot
of
people
lol
[sskarz]
oh
trust
me
I
know
how
this
goes
haha
when
you
have
strict
parents
,
you
know
how
to
hide
things
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
hey
can
i
ask
something
?
[sskarz]
yeah
of
course
[prabipyakurel]
When
you
were
in
your
previous
relationship
,
did
your
parents
know
?
[sskarz]
nope
never
,
my
sister
knew
though
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
,
so
you
know
how
to
hide
things
[sskarz]
yep
not
my
first
time
lol
[prabipyakurel]
And
why
did
it
end
,
if
you
dont
mind
sharing
?
its
okay
if
you
dont
want
to
[sskarz]
i
don
'
t
mind
sharing
at
all
,
dw
its
honestly
kind
of
complicated
without
knowing
how
it
started
in
the
first
place
but
to
shorten
things
down
essentially
,
she
cheated
on
me
,
and
obviously
when
someone
cheats
on
you
,
you
feel
like
the
worst
,
so
I
ended
things
with
her
.
[prabipyakurel]
oh
geez
,
im
so
sorry
,
yea
no
its
good
that
you
ended
it
off
.
She
didnt
deserve
you
,
thats
cruel
.
[sskarz]
yeah
it
was
a
very
...
interesting
time
I
'
ll
have
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
another
time
though
,
it
'
s
honestly
wild
how
that
all
happened
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
another
time
for
sure
,
i
would
love
to
hear
how
this
bitch
had
the
audacity
to
cheat
on
someone
like
you
.
😂
Sorry
for
the
language
[sskarz]
no
no
no
need
to
hide
the
language
haha
i
be
hiding
my
language
too
in
case
you
were
like
super
against
cursing
or
something
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Was
she
nepali
?
[sskarz]
nope
,
she
wasn
'
t
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
it
was
doomed
from
the
start
,
but
yk
,
i
wasn
'
t
exactly
the
smartest
back
then
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
but
its
okay
,
life
builds
us
and
sometimes
god
doesnt
let
things
work
out
and
settle
down
for
a
reason
.
[sskarz]
yeah
no
im
glad
i
learned
from
that
experience
,
but
i
don
'
t
miss
it
at
all
its
just
a
life
lesson
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
glad
you
ended
it
when
you
did
,
that
sucks
,
from
what
I
saw
happen
to
my
friend
this
years
,
i
hate
cheaters
And
because
people
cheat
,
that
is
why
sometimes
it
takes
me
a
while
to
fully
like
a
guy
you
know
,
like
some
of
them
are
nice
and
all
and
they
have
done
many
bad
things
.
[sskarz]
I
totally
get
that
,
you
have
to
protect
yourself
from
them
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
not
you
tho
,
I
love
you
,
but
some
boys
are
good
at
sweet
talking
and
they
are
the
worst
❤
️
[sskarz]
the
fuckboys
be
everywhere
lol
[prabipyakurel]
fr
But
hey
thanks

opening
up
,

it
🙂
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
'
m
always
open
,
I
'
ve
got
literally
nothing
to
hide
,
if
you
wanna
know
something
you
just
ask
❤
️
Being
honest
will
help
us
get
over
things
easily
and
that
'
s
what
I
intend
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
just
be
you
,
like
I
said
nothing
you
say
will
change
how
I
ever
see
you
.
You
can
share
anything
with
me
and
I
will
be
here
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
love
you
for
that
:)

who
I
am
with
my
own
struggles
and
my
past
.
Seriously
,

you
.
❤
️
Not
everyone
can
look
at
me
the
same
way
like
you
do
And
I
don
'
t
take
it
for
granted
[prabipyakurel]
No
need
to
ever
thank
me
,
you
are
so
strong
and
confident
,
it
makes
me
happy
that
I
have
someone
like
you
,
you
have
not
done
anything
wrong
for
me
to
look
at
you
from
any
other
perspective
.
You
are
just
being
you
and
went
though
things
that
you
didn
'
t
deserve
at
all
,
but
things
are
getting
better
for
you
and
will
continue
to
hopefully
.
But
keep
your
head
up
,
you
are
my
boy
and
you
got
this
.
I
will
always
accept
you
for
who
you
are
and
your
struggles
that
you
have
over
come
.
No
need
to
ever
thank
me
again
,
I
mean
it
,
dont
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
loooooooooooooooooooooove
you

t
stop

impacted
my
life

one
else
has
done

[prabipyakurel]
Awwww

a
lot
of
the
math
and
reading
done
and
now
I
am
just
sitting
and
resting
too
.
❤
️
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
well
I
'
m
ngl
I
was
so
tired
after
the
class
,
and
then
hearing
that
I
had
to
carry
stuff
back
and
forth
between
houses
I
was
like
ughh
.
But
I
went
and
did
it
,
and
that
took
like
2
hours
.
So
afterwards
,
I
was
like
,
I
already
did
so
much
lifting
,
so
I
might
as
well
just
go
straight
into
a
workout
.
Drove
from
my
cousin
'
s
house
,
to
my
house
,
got
some
caffeine
and
then
went
to
the
gym
.
So
here
'
s
the
crazy
part
:
I
met
Bijesh
and
the
whole
gang
there
and
they
were
working
out
too
.
As
well
as
one
CSULA
student
that
recognized
me
from
doing
the
presentations
in
multiple
of
their
classes
lol
.
That
was
pretty
cool
,
and
then
I
got
like
a
2
hour
workout
in
.
Absolutely
exhausted
myself
,
came
back
home
,
showered
and
drank
tons
of
water
.
also
you
are
just
too
cute
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
you
were
like
busy
busy
.
You
must
be
tired
after
all
that
,
see
so
many
people
recognize
you
,
you
are
already
starting
to
be
famous
.
Make
sure
to
rest
a
lot
and
drink
water
.
How
was
the
workout
,
was
it
like
a
short
and
quick
one
or
like
did
you
do
extra
too
?
ik
,
arent
I
[sskarz]
I
went
extra
hard
today
,
really
just
wanted
to
exhaust
all
my
energy
out
so
I
could
come
home
nice
and
relaxed
also
,
my
lunch
was
some
restaurant
food
,
and
it
was
full
of
carbs
so
I
needed
to
burn
that
off
lol
mhmmm
you
really
are
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
but
sometimes
its
okay
to
just
eat
outside
food
and
fall
asleep
,
i
be
doing
nothing
after
eating
lol
.
I
am
literally
burning
everything
I
eat
just
walking
around
campus
and
up
and
down
the
stairs
.
[sskarz]
yeah
your
campus
is
huge
,
that
cardio
comes
naturally
haha
[prabipyakurel]
But
sometimes
,
dont
exhaust
yourself
all
the
way
either
,
take
care
of
your
health
too
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
dw
dw
I
'
m
doing
this
all
within
healthy
boundaries
for
myself
It
'
s
good
to
push
yourself
to
your
healthy
limits
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
,
but
as
life
becomes
easier
I
will
find
time
to
go
to
the
gym
and
maybe
run
,
idk
what
else
to
do
in
there
😂
[sskarz]
I
think
you
'
d
like
the
gym
,
for
me
it
really
helps
me
mentally
and
gives
me
clarity
and
focus
👍
sure
its
tiring
but
the
feeling
after
is
unmatched
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
I
will
check
it
out
someday
.
So
what
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]

listening
to
some
music
and
vibing
looking
through
some
of
my
hw
to
check

[prabipyakurel]
Thats

?
[sskarz]

my
professors
will
post
a
homework
but
won
'
t

due
date
on

due
date
in
the
description
and
then
it
doesn
'
t

up
on
the
canvas

back
up
and
then

in
20
minutes
to
put
it
into
the
dryer
,
then
came
back
up
again
,
took
a
short
nap
,
then
went
down
to
pick
it
up
and
bring
it
back
.
Then

all
clothes
into

not
drank
anything
cold
or
ate
anything
oily
just
to
be
safe
and
not
get
sick

I
get
sick
,
I
cannot
risk
coming
and
spreading
my
sickness
to
you
I
am
doing
the
same
ngl
[sskarz]
I
honestly
could
care
less
,
I
'
m
still
giving
you
a
hug
even
if
you
got
the
worst
sickness
ever
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
have
covid
,
you
would
still
give
me
hug
?
[sskarz]
most
definitely
no
sickness
could
keep
me
away
from
you
❤
️
I
'
d
rather
suffer
with
you
than
to
be
far
apart
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
lol
dw
,
if
I
am
sick
,
I
am
staying
away
from
you
.
[sskarz]
too
late
,
I
'
m
gonna
run
up
to
you
and
hug
you
no
matter
what
I
want
you
in
my
arms
regardless
[prabipyakurel]
Now
I
am
really
hoping

[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

probably
could
,
but
I
would
seriously
just
count
the
minutes
to
24
hours
so
the
rule
ends
The
day
would
feel
pretty
boring
and
sad
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
,
lol
I
would
do
the
same
,
I
would
forget
midway

just
be
like

[sskarz]
💀
[prabipyakurel]

But

'
re
not
a
variable

me
haha
❤
️

dad
starts
claiming
its
afternoon
when
its
just
8
:
30
am
😂
but
tomororw
,

in
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

or
tomorrow
[prabipyakurel]
did
you
put
the
wrong
emoji
too
[sskarz]
yes
but
like
wdym

or
tomorrow
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
spelled
it
wrong
the
first
time
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhh
of
course
i
did
😵
i
didn
'
t
even
notice
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
been
quite
the
day
my
bad
lol
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
you
are
finee
im
just
messing
with
you
[sskarz]
love
you
for
that
haha
❤
️
i
didn
'
t
even
notice
,
im
just
like
so
out
of
it
this
album
i
'
m
listening
to
is
putting
me
in
a
trance
its
just
so
nice
its
like
my
brain
feels
so
relaxed
it
'
s
forgetting
to
think
😂
[prabipyakurel]
you
should
feel
relaxed
,
and
the
playlist
is
pretty
calm
and
smooth
,
lol
I
was
blasting
mexican
music
in
my
ear
like
before
I
was
texting
you
.
😂
[sskarz]
oh
comparing
this
to
what
i
listen
to
in
the
gym
couldn
'
t
be
more
opposite
😂
i
fr
might
go
deaf
for
how
loud
i
put
the
music
in
my
ears
lol
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
listen
to
some
motivating
music
at
the
gym
no
?
[sskarz]
yup
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
I
do
that
and
have
to
take
them
out
to
see
if
I
can
still
hear
.
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
might
need
to
do
one
of
those
hearing
tests
they
do
in
like
those
hospital
checkups
where
you
raise
your
hand
depending
on
where
you
hear
the
pitch
[prabipyakurel]
No
like
actually
,
I
got
that
done
and
they
told
me
I
need
to
go
check
it
out
.
[sskarz]
my
hearing
has
definitely
gotten
worse
over
the
years
[prabipyakurel]
Its
probably
like
ear
wax
[sskarz]
nah
i
clean
that
stuff
out
regularly
,
i
doubt
it
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
for
sure
,
at
this
point
when
I
tell
people
to
repeat
and
I
dont
hear
on
the
3rd
try
,
I
just
nod
and
agree
with
them
😭
[sskarz]
sameeeeeeee
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
talking
about
me
💀
💀
[sskarz]
you
gots
to
clean
that
out
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
gots
to
I
probably
will
soon
[sskarz]
that
'
s
probably
why
you
'
re
hearing
is
lower
than
usual
you
'
re
fine
...
most
likely
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
should
be
fine
,
i
will
make
sure
to
keep
that
in
mind
for
the
next
checkup
👍
[sskarz]
so
if
you
were
to
make
your
way
here
,
are
you
arriving
on
saturday
or
friday
?
[prabipyakurel]
Friday
night
[sskarz]
it
'
ll
probably
be
pretty
late
huh
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
pretty
late
,
I
got
class
until
4
and
my
cousin
got
something
to
do
until
5
It
will
be
like
a
late
night
drive
[sskarz]
make
sure
you
get
some
sleep
in
the
car
so
it
goes
faster
lol
that
drive
is
brutal
[prabipyakurel]
nah
,
I
will
just
be
thinking
about
you
and
listening
to
music
❤
️
gonna
be
thinking
about
how
to
greet
you
in
front
of
everyone
[sskarz]
like
how
we
usually
do
yk
like
:
oh
hey
my
beloved
boyfriend
😂
jk
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
I
will
say
that
in
my
mind
[sskarz]
imagine
that
tho
,
the
way
everyone
would
be
shocked
💀
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
do
a
side
hug
if
possible
and
maybe
a
hadshake
Oh
no
,
not
even
gonna
try
,
the
stare
and
lecture
back
home
[sskarz]
mmmmm
nah
i
'
ll
just
wave
at
you
,
keep
it
inconspicuous
yk
we
'
ve
never
done
like
a
side
hug
or
anything
before
[prabipyakurel]
True
true
,
damn
,
a
wave
it
is
[sskarz]
so
idk
might
raise
some
suspicions
,
espcially
to
my
nosy
cousin
lol
[prabipyakurel]
oh
right
,
he
be
watching
everything
closely
[sskarz]
very
he
almost
caught
me
today
,
i
was
teaching
and
he
came
up
to
me
,
and
my
phone
was
unlocked
and
on
discord
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
give
your
sister
a
big
hug
and
just
act
surprised
and
wave
at
you
❤
️
[sskarz]
the
way
i
just
flipped
over
my
phone
casually
lol
perfect
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Like
on
the
conversation
with
me
?
[sskarz]
like
i
had
just
finished
responding
to
you
and
he
came
up
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
,
keep
him
away
,
the
last
thing
i
need
is
someone
accidently
getting
their
hands
on
our
conversation
.
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
might
need
to
invest
into
a
privacy
screen
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Your
heart
probably
did
that
"
oh
shit
"
thing
[sskarz]
but
then
again
,
that
'
s
probably
raising
more
suspicions
then
protecting
anything
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
parents
are
gonna
be
like
,
why
did
you
suddenly
decide
to
put
that
?
😂
[sskarz]
yeahhh
i
just
froze
and
smoothly
just
flipped
my
phone
over
while
we
talked
oh
yeah
then
its
over
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
know
my
parents
are
hilarious
,
they
used
to
pretend
i
had
a
girlfriend
before
and
i
always
just
told
them
fake
stories
about
a
fake
person
😂
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
parents
will
ask
you
sus
questions
in
such
a
way
,
that
you
will
give
it
up
somehow
😂
[sskarz]
they
'
d
have
no
idea
if
they
asked
me
again
no
but
fr
real
detectives
[prabipyakurel]
they
will
just
think
you
are
talking
about
a
fake
person
again
[sskarz]
and
they
'
d
have
no
idea
what
developments
have
happened
since
the
last
time
they
joked
with
me
😂
just
something
i
thought
about
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
they
probably
wont
[sskarz]
trust
me
,
our
secret
stays
with
us
I
'
m
not
going
to
hint
at
anything
at
all
ever
until
we
'
re
both
confident
with
us
being
known
with
our
families
and
everyone
you
have
my
absolute
word
[prabipyakurel]
No
me
neither
,
yea
we
will
get
older
,
and
be
successful
,
then
when
we
are
both
able
to
,
confront
them
somehow
,
I
dont
know
how
the
hell
,
but
someway
that
doesnt
involve
getting
a
lecture
back
.
😂
[sskarz]
the
lecture
is
inevitable
haha
,
but
we
can
worry
about
that
later
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
means
a
lot
,
you
mean
the
absolute
world
to
me
.
❤
️
Thats
a
few
years
later
problem
.
Actually
a
lot
of
years
later
problem
[sskarz]
you
'
re
starting
to
form
your
own
corner
in
my
heart
and
it
grows
by
the
coming
days
exactly
why
we
shouldn
'
t
worry
about
such
things
❤
️
let
'
s
just
focus
on
us
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
things
will
get
better
in
the
future
,
they
got
to
understand
,
I
will
make
them
.
Ahhhhhhh
you
are
so
awesome
,
you
are
literally
like
my
everything
and
lol
my
entire
heart
belongs
to
you
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
'
m
sure
they
will
,
mine
would
probably
be
thrilled
to
have
you
I
won
'
t
lie
awwwwww
I
love
you
so
much
❤
️
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
,
you
dont
even
know
,
everyone
in
my
household
love
you
for
their
reasons
.
[sskarz]
you
'
re
literally
my
favorite
person
to
think
about
and
talk
to
our
future
together
is
bright
,
I
already
know
don
'
t
you
worry
about
a
thing
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
It
really
is
,
and
I
am
sure
I
will
love
it
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
except
maybe
my
spelling
,
let
'
s
hope
that
gets
better
too
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
is
not
going
to
improve
,
just
gotta
get
used
to
both
of
us
being
clumsy
like
that
lol
.
😂
Wont
ever
have
to
,
you
are
with
me
,
I
will
be
just
fine
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
you
know
,
it
gives
me
a
reason
to
smile
even
more
when
we
'
re
both
this
clumsy
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
And
it
feel
so
much
better
when
I
can
tell
you
how
I
feel
without
thinking
if
its
gonna
sound
weird
you
know
before
we
confessed
and
all
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
me
too
haha
so
many
times
i
'
ve
held
back
from
saying
something
i
had
no
idea
if
you
were
interested
in
me
at
all
,
or
you
were
just
reciprocating
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
was
interested
in
you
the
day
I
saw
you
[sskarz]
you
know
,
people
can
be
confusing
when
you
'
re
in
that
stage
[prabipyakurel]
and
the
time
I
left
your
house
[sskarz]
awwwwwwww
you
'
re
the
SWEETEST
i
swear
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
can
,
I
fr
just
thought
you
saw
me
as
a
college
freshmen
that
just
talked
a
lot
,
and
would
always
think
,
is
he
interested
in
me
,
or
is
he
just
being
him
?
[sskarz]
both
:)
I
love
you
the
most
when
I
can
be
myself
without
worrying
about
anything
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Me
too
,
I
am
so
comfortable
talking
with
you
,
like
I
dont
even
think
at
this
point
I
just
speak
[sskarz]
haha
I
'
m
really
glad
you
can
speak
your
mind
You
can
always
talk
to
me
about
anything
in
the
world
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
will
,
and
you
too
.
You
know
the
things
you
said
to
me
before
you
told
me
you
likes
me
,
I
am
ngl
,
I
used
to
search
up
like
"
what
does
it
mean
when
a
boy
says
this
or
that
"
and
looking
back
at
our
conversation
,
it
seems
really
obvious
now
.
😂
[sskarz]
OMG
that
'
s
hilarious
hahaha
😂
I
really
wish
I
knew
what
you
searched
up
,
god
that
would
be
gold
to
look
through
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
dont
,
I
searched
up
everything
you
said
.
Like
I
kept
every
word
in
my
mind
and
would
go
back
and
read
it
over
and
over
to
figure
it
out
.
But
was
too
scared
to
ask
you
if
you
felt
that
way
.
[sskarz]
awwwwwwww
you
'
re
so
adorableeeeeeeeeeeee
❤
️
I
can
'
t
believe
you
really
had
to
search
that
stuff
up
😂
that
really
made
my
night
[prabipyakurel]
I
did
,
hey
I
have
not
gotten
these
feelings
ever
before
I
am
so
glad
that
my
first
love
is
you
,
and
I
know
that
you
are
the
one
and
that
just
makes
me
feel
so
secure
and
safe
.
❤
️
Yea
its
a
lot
of
things
,
trust
me
.
[sskarz]
I
know
you
'
re
my
better
half
,
I
'
m
just
glad
I
'
ve
finally
realized
that
with
you
❤
️
it
took
a
bit
to
get
to
this
point
,
but
it
'
s
all
worth
it
[prabipyakurel]
Always
,
i
wanna
get
a
matching
necklace
,
you
know
the
heart
one
that
connects
together
,
and
I
just
want
each
of
us
to
have
a
piece
of
it
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
would
love
that
,
maybe
when
we
can
have
some
more
time
together
we
can
go
shopping
[prabipyakurel]
Everything
is
worth
it
with
you
.
❤
️
Yea
for
sure
,
its
on
my
mind
.
[sskarz]
I
couldn
'
t
say
it
better
to
you
❤
️
UGH
7
more
days
just
gotta
endure
it
😂
it
feels
sooooooo
far
awayyyyyyyy
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
pass
dw
,
I
will
be
there
soon
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
can
'
t
wait
to
see
you
:)
[prabipyakurel]
For
reals
,
I
just
cant
wait
to
just
see
you
and
be
near
you
for
like
however
long
that
event
is
.
[sskarz]
lets
forget
the
event
,
just
be
with
me
haha
its
not
possible
but
that
'
s
what
I
wish
for
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
wish
[sskarz]
are
you
leaving
sunday
morning
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
that
depends
,
if
my
aunt
has
no
where
to
vist
and
go
to
,
we
might
leave
mid
-
day
sunday
,
but
if
not
we
might
leave
monday
morning
since
its
labor
day
weekend
.
And
if
there
was
a
party
the
previous
night
,
maybe
not
sunday
morning
.
[sskarz]
maybe
if
you
don
'
t
leave
on
sunday
,
we
can
just
hangout
for
a
bit
?
somehow
...
haha
i
won
'
t
count
on
it
though
[prabipyakurel]
No
just
hearing
that
gave
me
chills
,
trust
me
,
I
came
home
after
a
week
,
they
are
not
letting
me
go
anywhere
alone
,
aside
from
the
restroom
.
😂
The
urge
tho
,
I
wish
I
would
just
be
like
,
"
imma
go
see
a

'
T

I
SAID
I
LIKED
YOU
FIRST
,
CLEARLY
I
LOVE
YOU
MORE
!!!!!
this
is
no
debate
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
have
liked
you
for
like
2
years
and
you
probably
didnt
even
know
so
[sskarz]
yeah
I
had
no
clue
💀
[prabipyakurel]
no
there
is
a
reasonable
debate
here
exactly
so
its
me
first
[sskarz]
you
know
I
'
m
dumb
as
rocks
to
take
any
sort
of
hint
at
all
but
still
I
love
you
more
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
idk
if
i
ever
gave
you
hints
,
i
always
though
you
would
find
it
weird
but
i
tried
my
best
❤
️
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
you
were
elusive
,
too
small
of
hints
to
tell
if
you
were
just
being
nice
or
you
liked
me
and
I
thought
if
I
gave
away
too
much
,
you
would
slowly
disconnect
from
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
would
never
,
my
heart
always
raced
and
beat
so
fast
when
I
talked
to
you
.
Like
I
would
have
discord
open
so
I
would
never
miss
your
message
.
Also
,
just
finished
the
playlist
,
it
was
awesome
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
’
s
an
album
but
yk
close
enough
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
oh
ok
lol
sorry
[sskarz]
I
’
m
really
loving
this
album
,
it
’
s
putting
me
in
such
a
good
mood
[prabipyakurel]
but
yea
the
album
lo
i
finished
it
[sskarz]
Hahaha
you
’
re
good
[prabipyakurel]
you
arent
alone
I
have
literally
played
this
in
the
background
talking
to
you
and
I
just
fits
the
mood
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
add
that
to
the
date
playlist
😂
😂
I
feel
incredibly
relaxed
right
now
,
and
I
’
m
laying
down
in
bed
texting
you
with
this
music
,
I
couldn
’
t
ask
for
more
I
feel
like
I
’
m
gonna
sink
into
my
bed
I
need
this
on
vinyl
,
I
’
ve
decided
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
always
relaxing
talking
to
you
too
,
about
literally
anything
.
Just
calms
me
down
and
gets
me
ready
for
the
next
day
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
You
make
me
so
happy
you
don
’
t
even
know
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
should
have
asked
for
your
discord
the
time
time
I
met
you
,
i
had
barely
gotten
discord
and
I
was
going
and
asking
everyone
like
crazy
.
😂
And
i
missed
you
,
the
one
person
I
should
have
gotten
it
from
.
[sskarz]
I
wanted
to
ask
for
your
number
,
but
I
thought
it
was
too
soon
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Like
then
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
the
first
day
No
lie
I
was
unsure
still
because
I
hadn
’
t
felt
like
that
before
,
but
I
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
if
I
gave
it
a
chance
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
trust
me
when
I
say
this
,
I
am
not
a
big
fan
of
giving
my
number
out
and
will
avoid
the
question
,
but
that
night
I
saw
you
and
I
was
like
,
okay
if
he
asks
,
you
give
it
to
him
.
[sskarz]
And
then
I
got
scared
😂
That
’
s
completely
fair
,
I
’
m
kinda
glad
I
waited
till
I
confessed
my
love
for
you
😂
Just
to
be
sure
yk
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
so
scared
,
you
and
my
brother
and
the
kid
went
upstairs
,
and
I
came
in
after
,
I
thought
you
were
gonna
find
me
so
weird
and
all
.
[sskarz]
Noooo
I
was
interested
in
talking
with
you
the
most
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
the
love
was
already
there
,
we
both
were
just
doubting
it
.
[sskarz]
But
you
gave
me
shy
girl
vibes
so
I
didn
’
t
want
to
force
any
conversation
that
would
lead
to
my
demise
haha
just
rode
the
wave
for
what
you
were
comfortable
with
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
sweet
[sskarz]
My
#
1
goal
with
meeting
new
people
and
getting
to
know
them
is
having
them
be
comfortable
around
me
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
I
saw
you
after
your
dad
called
and
introduced
you
and
i
was
like
just
staring
at
you
.
[sskarz]
no
u
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
for
sure
.
[sskarz]
Omg
that
was
so
uncomfortable
when
my
dad
was
introducing
me
😭
I
was
like
dad
stoppppp
You
’
re
turning
her
awayyyy
[prabipyakurel]
No
he
wasnt
,
because
he
came
to
ours
for
the
previous
meeting
and
he
was
talking
about
how
you
went
to
mark
keppel
and
then
he
moved
you
and
stuff
,
and
I
was
so
excited
to
meet
you
that
time
.
And
then
I
did
,
and
it
was
just
amazing
,
I
followed
your
mom
when
she
was
giving
the
house
tour
to
the
other
people
and
I
was
like
"
great
chance
to
go
up
and
introduce
myself
to
him
"
😭
[sskarz]
You
are
so
god
damn
adorable
ugh
❤
️
You
make
my
heart
ache
in
the
best
way
possible
[prabipyakurel]
My
heart
warms
up
so
much
when
I
even
read
your
messages
,
and
then
i
just
freeze
and
I
love
that
feeling
.
And
there
was
this
other
time
when
there
was
some
sort
of
event
at
your
house
,
but
only
my
parents
went
because
I
think
we
had
someone
over
and
I
think
your
dad
had
told
you
that
we
were
coming
,
and
my
dad
was
like
sanskar
came
down
to
meet
you
,
we
should
have
taken
you
.
I
was
like
seriously
,
like
I
was
begging
for
them
to
take
me
.
[sskarz]
OMG
yeah
I
wanted
to
see
you
I
was
kinda
sad
when
I
couldn
’
t
see
you
I
was
like
damn
,
did
I
say
something
or
do
something
to
make
her
avoid
me
?
The
classic
doubting
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
no
never
Yea
and
my
mom
was
like
,
he
came
running
but
didnt
get
to
meet
you
.
I
was
like
,
"
yuh
because
you
didnt
take
me
when
I
wanted
to
go
"
[sskarz]
You
had
no
idea
,
I
heard
your
parents
were
coming
over
and
I
made
sure
to
look
and
be
my
best
haha
I
wanted
to
make
better
impressions
[prabipyakurel]
You
dont
need
to
try
looking
the
best
,
you
were
already
so
cute
and
perfect
❤
️
Like
when
I
used
to
go
to
alish
dada
'
s
house
for
the
teej
programs
and
stuff
,
I
would
take
a
little
walk
around
their
house
just
to
see
if
I
could
get
like
a
small
glimpse
of
you
from
anywhere
.
Like
I
felt
so
happy
just
going
to
their
house
,
knowing
you
were
right
next
door
.
[sskarz]
WHY
ARE
YOU
SO
DAMN
PERFECT
OMG
This
can
’
t
be
real
I
need
to
wake
up
rn
because

to
make
me
cry
of
happiness

pefect
and
i
stand
by
my
words
,
like
your
heart
is
so
pure
.
You
just

me
love
myself
and
everything
.
Like
just
a
word
from
you

away
my
stress
and
pain
for
the
day
.
I

I
would

[prabipyakurel]

how
I
managed
to
get
you
to
be
mine
.
[sskarz]
Me

And
here
I
thought
you
were
too
good
for
me
,
I
mean
really
I
thought
I
had
no
chance
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
no
,
I
am
not
even
near
your
level
,
I
thought
I
never
had
a
chance
[sskarz]
my
stars

aligned
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
’
re
so
much

me
hahaha
,

I
’
ve
worked
so
hard
knowing
that
you

I
’
ve
never
felt
happier
ever
[prabipyakurel]
And
keep
going
,
I
will
always
be
here
.
❤
️
Do
you
know
when
you
came
over
to
my
old
house
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
!
I
remember
because
it
was
tough
to
find
parking
that
day
haha
And
you
were
there
And
that
’
s
all
my
brain
needed
to
keep
it
as
a
vivid
memory
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
your
parents
came
in
and
my
dad
was
like
,
"
sanskar
didn
'
t
come
"
and
your
dad
was
like
he
was
a
little
busy
,
and
I
was
like
oh
okay
,
not
gonna
see
him
.
[sskarz]
But
I
did
!
[prabipyakurel]
No
and
trust
me
,
when
you
appeared
from
the
back
,
I
was
like
,
omg
.
That
was
the
best
moment
of
my
life
.
[sskarz]
I
really
couldn
’
t
miss
seeing
you
I
needed
to
know
if
that
feeling
I
felt
was
real
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
the
room
was
a
little
small
and
I
was
like
,
damn
I
hope
he
is
comfortable
here
.
[sskarz]
I
was
haha
,
eating
on
that
high
bed
and
talking
to
you
was
the
best
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
was
so
glad
you
came
by
that
day
.
[sskarz]
I
couldn
’
t
miss
it
I
did
everything
to
make
sure
I
could
come
Did
everything
and
finished
all
of
my
work
Quicker
than
ever
That
feeling
I
felt
with
you
,
it
was
like
nothing
before
,
and
I
needed
to
know
if
I
really
was
in
love
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
just
awesome
,
and
I
loved
that
you
stayed
after
a
little
,
that
was
really
fun
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
was
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
just
had
to
come
and
confirm
no
?
[sskarz]
I
needed
to
know
,
but
I
had
it
in
the
back
of
my
mind
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
never
felt
this
way
with
anyone
,
it
was
an
amazing
feeling
.
[sskarz]
Me
neither
,
this
is
unlike
anything
I
’
ve
ever
felt
Like
I
’
ve
never
felt
so
connected
with
someone
Even
just
texting
you
[prabipyakurel]
No
just
that
conversation
on
fourth
of
july
set
this
thing
off
and
I
was
so
amazed
by
that
.
[sskarz]
I
just
know
you
’
re
out
there
,
striving
to
be
your
best
,
and
that
makes
me
love
you
so
much
more
I
’
m
so
so
so
so
so
glad
I
sent
it
I
was
really
close
to
just
saying
,
ah
that
’
s
stupid
I
shouldn
’
t
just
say
this
out
of
nowhere
But
something
just
felt
right
Like
it
was
meant
to
be
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
,
I
am
starting
to
think
it
was
just
destined
from
the
beginning
.
I
thought
I
was
just
ugly
,
turns
out
god
had
better
and
probably
the
best
plan
for
me
.
[sskarz]
My
god
you
’
re
beautiful
,
don
’
t
think
any
thing
else
You
’
re
so
pretty
like
really
I
’
m
stunned
every
time
I
see
you
And
that
’
s
the
truth
You
know
I
’
m
honest
to
everything
I
say
[prabipyakurel]
I
LOVE
YOU
❤
️
[sskarz]
love
you
more
❤
️
I
feel
right
at
home
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
And
the
4th
of
july
you
texted
me
,
we
had
people
over
too
,
you
dont
know
how
fast
I
cleaned
everything
up
and
told
everyone
to
forget
about
looking
outside
at
fireworks
and
go
to
bed
so
I
can
go
to
my
bed
,
turn
off
the
lights
and
have
a
conversation
with
you
.
I
didn
'
t
brush
that
night
,
i
literally
jumped
into
my
PJs
and
was
like
,
nope
dont
got
that
time
😂
You
are
like
my
home
❤
️
You
are
just
a
part
of
me
now
and
will
forever
be
[sskarz]
Hahahaha
the
way
I
forgot
it
was
the
4th
of
July
when
our
conversation
kept
going
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
[sskarz]
And
you
’
re
a
part
of
me
❤
️
Oh
?
[prabipyakurel]
Like
in
the
beginning
I
was
so
happy
when
I
got
my
message
from
you
,
and
my
brother
was
like
"
yea
I
am
currently
taking
to
sanskar
dada
right
now
,
and
i
was
like
oh
I
guess
he
was
just
sending
it
to
both
siblings
then
"
But
now
when
you
tell
me
that
you
wanted
it
to
start
a
conversation
and
as
to
why
you
sent
it
to
the
both
if
us
,
it
is
the
most
sweetest
thing
ever
.
❤
️
Those
fireworks
were
for
us
,
it
was
not
for
the
fourth
of
july
.
[sskarz]
That
was
my
cover
up
hahaha
Omg
my
sister
and
my
uncle
just
barged
into
my
room
just
now
and
I
flipped
my
phone
under
my
covers
haha
they
can
’
t
keep
doing
this
to
me
😭
It
really
was
,
I
’
d
love
the
chance
to
see
the
fireworks
with
you
it
’
ll
feel
like
it
all
came
full
circle
[prabipyakurel]
Great
excuse
,
next
summer
,
tell
my
brother
and
he
will
make
my
parents
invite
you
guys
to
watch
it
together
in
like
the
park
or
somehting
.
ahahaha
for
real
[sskarz]
Hmmm
but
I
want
it
to
just
be
you
and
me
,
so
yk
I
don
’
t
have
to
distance
myself
from
you
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Did
they
see
anything
?
[sskarz]
Nah
not
a
chance
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
,
I
just
want
to
be
in
your
arms
with
a
blanket
and
food
just
looking
up
at
the
sky
.
We
will
find
a
time
though
,
our
time
will
come
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Oh
that
sounds
too
good
❤
️
Looking
so
forward
to
it
I
can
’
t
wait
🥰
[prabipyakurel]
Me
neither
.
We
got
many
things
to
do
,
and
as
I
get
used
to
like
college
and
stuff
,
after
some
time
I
should
be
able
to
tell
my
parents
like
I
am
going
with
a
few
friends
of
mine
,
and
they
wont
mind
.
Other
times
I
will
sneak
out
to
see
you
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
sneak
out
with
a
backup
plan
okay
,
I
don
’
t
wanna
do
anything
that
’
s
gonna
jeopardize
us
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
have
a
coverup
story
ready
,
if
anything
a
homeless
man
chased
me
to
the
park
and
I
just
came
running
back
😂
[sskarz]
We
will
workshop
it
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
for
sure
Did
your
sister
and
uncle
have
anything
to
say
,
or
they
randomly
just
came
in
?
[sskarz]
Oh
nah
they
came
in
just
to
mess
with
me
💀
They
also
needed
a
blanket
,
but
damn
they
came
in
with
guns
blazing
hahaha
trust
me
they
don
’
t
know
anything
I
’
m
good
at
hiding
things
physically
😂
[prabipyakurel]
But
we
are
not
doing
anything
illegal
,
its
just
when
you
have
strict
parents
and
a
strict
household
in
general
,
everytime
I
am
talking
to
you
and
they
barge
in
,
I
got
to
act
like
I
am
hiding
drugs
.
😭
Yea
get
used
to
flipping
that
phone
over
under
the
sheets
[sskarz]
Hey
both
of
our
parents
like
us
,
idk
about
the
idea
of
us
together
,
but
if
it
ever
came
to
that
situation
,
I
’
m
fighting
for
us
❤
️
Been
doing
it
my
whole
life
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
trust
me
,
i
dont
care
what
anyone
says
,
I
am
gonna
be
with
you
no
matter
what
.
❤
️
Meh
they
are
fine
with
us
,
I
am
not
even
worrying
about
that
part
Aside
from
your
dog
,
who
is
still
scary
as
of
now
,
everyone
is
lovely
😂
[sskarz]
I
’
m
so
determined
to
be
with
you
,
I
will
fight
everyone
that
dares
to
question
my
feelings
with
you
You
’
ll
come
to
love
him
too
,
maybe
not
yet
but
eventually
😂
He
’
s
an
even
bigger
sweetheart
than
I
am
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
I
am
fighting
with
anyone
that
tries
to
destroy
anything
between
us
or
says
something
about
the
both
of
us
,
they
can
go
to
hell
.
❤
️
Awwww
,
yea
that
time
will
come
too
.
😂
[sskarz]
When
you
find
out
how
fluffy
he
is
,
it
’
ll
be
instant
love
haha
[prabipyakurel]
No
when
I
am
comfortable
with
the
dog
,
he
is
mine
too
😂
And
being
the
better
one
,
I
will
tell
him
not
to
eat
bees
instead
of
continuously
asking
him
"
you
like
bees
bear
"
"
yea
you
like
bees
"
💀
[sskarz]
Omg
I
saw
him
hunting
more
bees
the
other
day
😂
He
’
s
really
a
menace
out
there
The
poor
bees
fearing
for
their
lives
😭
[prabipyakurel]
They
gonna
stop
coming
over
to
yours
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
exactly
have
the
best
history
with
bees
Back
in
my
old
house
,
there
was
this
huge
hive
right
outside
my
garage
and
every
time
I
left
the
house
,
I
had
to
run
past
the
active
hive
just
so
I
wouldn
’
t
piss
off
any
hornet
that
was
bored
and
wanted
to
sting
someone
lol
😂
They
fr
traumatized
me
with
how
they
chased
me
sometimes
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
ever
get
bitten
though
?
[sskarz]
Surprisingly
I
have
no
memory
of
being
stung
[prabipyakurel]
They
probably
went
out
to
sting
those
that
deserved
it
Are
you
still
a
little
scared
of
them
?
[sskarz]
If
I
see
one
near
me
I
’
m
running
at
least
half
a
mile
before
I
check
over
my
shoulder
😂
It
’
s
one
of
the
few
insects
that
actually
scare
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
got
you
,
if
there
is
a
bee
or
a
wasp
,
I
will
get
it
away
from
you
[sskarz]
Omg
you
’
re
really
perfect
,
my
savior
I
gotchu
from
spiders
you
don
’
t
even
need
to
worry
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
,
like
when
I
go
out
to
water
my
flowers
back
home
,
the
bees
be
chillin
flying
doing
their
thing
and
if
they
come
near
me
,
the
most
I
would
do
is
shut
the
front
door
so
they
wont
get
in
But
I
just
wave
my
hands
slightly
and
they
will
move
on
Don
'
t
worry
,
nothing
is
harming
you
I
love
you
[sskarz]
See
I
did
that
one
time
as
a
kid
,
and
me
being
unlucky
,
I
pissed
off
a
wasp
and
I
ran
for
my
life
I
love
you
more
bae
[prabipyakurel]
No
there
are
always
wasps
around
my
new
house
,
and
like
multiple
used
to
just
hover
when
I
was
watering
the
plans
,
I
think
there
might
be
a
small
hive
under
one
of
the
bushes
or
something
.
But
wasps
are
okay
,
if
you
leave
them
alone
too
Now
those
flying
beetles
and
big
cockroaches
,
those
are
a
problem
,
I
will
leave
and
run
.
[sskarz]
They
all
banded
together
,
had
a
bee
meeting
,
and
said
if
they
saw
me
it
’
s
sting
on
sight
I
swear
😭
Hahaha
yeah
we
’
ll
run
away
together
on
that
one
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
you
are
really
sweet
,
so
maybe
,
just
maybe
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
I
see
what
you
did
there
*
honey

:)
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
it
omg
,

those
either
?
[sskarz]
Oh

that
jumps
quick
or
flies
,
I
’
m
out
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
we
will
both
run
together
[sskarz]
Cuz
I
can
’
t
stomp
them
easily
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
I
dont
even
have
the
courage
to
stomp
on
anything
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
’
ve
got
a
website
full
of
nicknames
for
lovers

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well

back
to
sleep
So
I
’
m
just
awake
now
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
maybe
don
’
t
go
anywhere
today
and
just
sit
at
home
and
take
a
day
off
work
.
Then
maybe
it
will
help
you
fall
asleep
easier
at
night
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Ah
yeah
something
like
that
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

[sskarz]
Awwwww

It

you
the
future
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ikr
,
Saturday
will
be
so
awesome
.
But
hey
I
’
m
worried
about
you
,
you
need
to
do
something
about
your
sleep
.
Try
sleeping
at
9
or
10
instead
of
11
and
see
if
that
helps
today
?
[sskarz]
No
no
I
’
m
totally
okay
haha
,
I
think
I
slept
around
11
last
night
,
basically
right
after
texting
you
I
passed
out
Still
got
a
good
7
hours
and
I
feel
good
👍
Don
’
t
worry
too
much
about
me
love
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh
okay
okay
,
but
yea
sometimes
don
’
t
over
exhaust
yourself
even
though
you
feel
good
afterwards
,
you
are
human
,
and
you
need
the
rest
and
energy
too
.
[sskarz]
I
gotchu
So
what
’
s
the
plan
for
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
really
,
probably
gonna
compete
some
more
reading
and
that
’
s
pretty
much
it
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Well
I
’
m
gonna
go
to
the
gym
at
10
,
then
do
a
bit
of
hw
,
and
after
that
I
’
m
free
for
literally
anything
Taking
today
easy
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
seems
like
an
easy
day
.
How
long
do
you
plan
to
stay
at
the
gym
?
[sskarz]
Eh
probably
an
hour
or
hour
and
a
half
max
It
’
s
leg
day
so
I
don
’
t
wanna
spend
more
time
than
I
need
to
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
,
yes
drink
water
and
take
care
of
yourself
,
you
wanna
be
able
to
walk
to
your
car
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
today
is
gonna
be
a
brutal
day
Every
leg
day
is
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
do
you
only
focus
on
working
out
your
legs
[sskarz]
On
leg
days
yeah
So
I
have
a
3
day
split
for
different
workouts
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
idea
what
that
is
when
people
say
leg
day
,
I
assume
you
only
work
on
the
legs
[sskarz]
It
’
s
called
Push
Pull
Legs
.
On
Push
day
it
’
s
all
about
chest
,
shoulders
,
and
Tricep
On
Pull
day
it
’
s
all
about
back
,
and
bicep
On
Leg
day

lower
half
of
the
body
Yup
basically
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

learn
things

[sskarz]
Takes
time
to
learn

stuff
👍
Hey

Hi

?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
feeling
pretty
tired
lol
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
did
you
finish
the
chair
?
[sskarz]
Uh
it
’
ll
be
fixed
another
day
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
have
been
just
catching
up
on
reading
and
a
little
bit
of
math
.
I
got
momo
for
lunch
and
now
I
am
just
chilling
for
a
little
.
Ah
,
too
tired
to
take
it
apart
and
all
?
[sskarz]
Ooooh
the
momo
sounds
fire
Yeah
,
it
’
s
honestly
more
mental
than
anything
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
was
good
,
and
then
like
you
know
the
oil
inside
the
momo
,
like
it
squirted
everywhere
when
I
bit
into
it
,
omg
i
was
just
using
the
sanitizing
wipes
to
wipe
everything
down
.
😂
Its
okay
,
just
complete
it
another
day
.
[sskarz]
That
’
s
how
u
know
it
’
s
good
steamed
momo
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
fried
momo
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
we
’
ll
see
👍
Oh
even
better
!
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
like
it
was
yellow
everywhere
and
I
was
just
having
a
good
discussion
about
that
with
myself
alone
in
the
room
.
😂
[sskarz]
Has
it
got
lonely
with
just
you
there
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
help
me
😭
[sskarz]
Awwww
I
couldn
’
t
text
earlier
because
I
had
to
finish
up
a
couple
of
assignments
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
okay
,
I
was
doing
the
same
,
I
was
panicking
a
little
,
but
got
through
a
good
amount
of
reading
for
the
day
.
[sskarz]
Also
don
’
t
your
roommates
come
back
tonight
or
tomorrow
?
Why
the
panicking
?
[prabipyakurel]
They
should
be
back
tonight
,
and
if
not
then
tomorrow
.
👍
I
don
'
t
know
exactly
why
,
but
I
just
got
scared
about
everything
and
it
just
happened
.
[sskarz]
Like
a
panic
attack
?
[prabipyakurel]
But
then
I
had
momo
and
started
watching
this
new
pakistani
drama
,
so
doing
better
.
👍
No
no
,
its
just
that
I
started
thinking
about
classes
and
all
,
but
im
good
now
.
[sskarz]
Oh
okay
,
glad
you
’
re
doing
better
now
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
dont
have
panic
attacks
,
when
I
need
to
let
it
out
,
I
usually
just
cry
in
a
pillow
or
just
like
in
the
restroom
,
the
one
time
i
did
have
a
panic
attack
was
when
I
was
picking
classes
.
That
was
just
a
horrible
day
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
remember
,
you
were
super
stressed
out
Hey
if
you
’
re
panicking
about
stuff
,
talk
to
me
.
I
can
knock
some
sense
back
in
haha
The
least
I
can
do
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
go
to
you
first
,
i
know
you
are
there
on
the
other
side
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Good
to
hear
,
but
thankfully
you
got
that
resolved
But

now
?
[prabipyakurel]
Sitting
alone
staring
at
the
laptop
and
now
taking
to
you
[sskarz]

would
make
sense
do
you
wanna
call
later

[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
free
to
do
that
?
[sskarz]
I
can
make
time
for
you
Not

[prabipyakurel]
❤

m
feeding

every
night
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

I
finished
with
him
👍
how
was
your
dinner
?
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
BBQ
pizza
and
fries
I
was
still
kinda
full
from
the
momo
so
I
only
ate
like
a
small
slice
and
few
fries
It
was
good
though
.
[sskarz]
that
sounds
pretty
good
you
feeling
full
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

of
[sskarz]
make
sure
you

lots
of
water

[prabipyakurel]
Hey

I
was
in
the
restroom
.
Day
was
normal
,
just
math
and
it
wasn
’
t
too
bad
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
No
need
to
apologize
for
being
in
the
restroom
lol
,
my
day
was
decent
❤
️
just
took
forever
,
its
the
longest
day
of
the
week
for
me
in
terms
of
like
classes
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
,
but
one
of
them
was
cancelled
no
?
[sskarz]
yeah
well
my
professor
cancels
every
other
monday
,
and
it
started
this
week
and
I
walked
into
an
empty
class
,
sat
down
for
like
20
minutes
and
then
realized
I
'
m
an
idiot
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Well
that
’
s
because
you
are
an
idiot
😆
❤
️
Jk
jk
I
’
m
sorry
[sskarz]
no
need
to
be
sorry
!
seriously
when
you
speaking
facts
like
this
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
that
must
have
felt
kind
of
dumb
lol
,
when
did
you
realize
?
[sskarz]
20
mins
after
sitting
there
,
with
my
laptop
open
waiting
for
the
professor
,
or
like
anyone
i
thought
i
was
going
insane
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Noooo
it
’
s
not
facts
,
I
love
you
,
you
are
not
an
idiot
❤
️
[sskarz]
im
your
little
idiot
:)
also
love
u
too
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
imagine
just
waiting
for
the
professor
and
he
never
showed
up
You
didn
’
t
realize
when
you
were
the
only
soul
in
the
hall
[sskarz]
well
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
the
hall
,
just
not
for
my
class
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhh
you
are
too
adorable
,
yea
you
might
be
❤
️
Ohhhh
I
see
,
but
it
’
s
okay
it
happens
.
At
least
you
sat
down
for
20
min
[sskarz]
yea
im
not
making
the
same
mistake
again
lol
😂
your
class
went
smoothly
?
right
,
you
learned
about
polynomials
right
or
something
along
those
lines
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
took
notes
and
a
nap
both
[sskarz]
righttttttttt
haha
i
was
about
to
fall
asleep
in
my
last
class
,
i
was
so
bored
[prabipyakurel]
No
if
you
are
ever
sitting
next
to
me
in
class
or
something
,
I
will
always
have
like
5
or
10
mins
where
my
eyes
are
like
“
nah
it
’
s
time
”
😂
It
’
s
especially
boring
when
the
teacher
isn
’
t
interesting
[sskarz]
oh
i
would
love
to
be
in
the
same
classes
as
you
,
i
wishh
i
'
d
keep
you
awake
at
least
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
wouldn
’
t
,
I
would
just
zone
out
and
pass
out
Maybe
in
the
future
,
maybe
[sskarz]
what
i
would
do
if
i
sat
next
to
u
[prabipyakurel]
Every
5
min
[sskarz]
yes
:)
[prabipyakurel]
You
be
poking
me
,
imma
slowly
start
leaning
on
you
and
falling
asleep
[sskarz]
i
guess
i
stay
winning
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwwww
but
yes
that
would
be
so
cute
Like
I
am
telling
you
in
high
school
I
slept
through
my
math
and
English
class
and
the
teachers
would
pick
on
everyone
else
but
me
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
lucky
,
i
always
got
called
on
💀
unfair
fr
[prabipyakurel]
Aha
loser
😂
[sskarz]
like
i
had
a
professor
that
just
loved
picking
on
me
and
then
when
i
realized
that
,
i
aced
every
single
question
for
like
a
week
and
he
stopped
picking
on
me
i
was
so
annoyed
by
that
guy
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
because
you
were
smart
That
’
s
why
[sskarz]
nah
i
just
forced
caffeine
before
the
class
so
i
could
stay
awake
😂
😂
he
had
like
the
most
**
monotone
**
voice
ever
and
it
'
s
somewhat
relaxing
,
and
when
nothing
is
happening
,
i
just
dozed
off
and
all
of
the
work
i
could
just
do
outside
of
the
class
but
attendance
was
mandatory
aka
sleep
time
because
i
did
all
the
work
before
class
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
like
imagining
how
you
would
look
dozing
off
and
sleeping
in
class
No
but
in
high
school
I
had
classes
where
I
went
in
and
was
like
okay
nap
time
,
and
no
one
cared
.
Like
people
had
to
text
me
to
wake
up
And
I
had
to
do
the
same
for
notes
[sskarz]
ohhhh
and
this
happened
recently
,
my
english
teacher
also
called
me
and
a
couple
others
out
for
turning
in
an
in
class
assignment
before
the
class
had
even
started
(
because
she
posted
the
entire
list
of
assignments
on
canvas
so
now
im
like
2
weeks
ahead
on
work
)
i
was
like
,
well
then
don
'
t
post
everything
🤔
nappy
time
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
that
’
s
impressive
,
be
proud
she
called
you
out
That
’
s
the
math
professor
rn
,
dude
posted
27
assignments
at
once
[sskarz]
nah
she
literally
unsubmitted
our
work
for
some
of
them
and
im
like
,
u
know
im
just
gonna
turn
it
in
again
when
its
due
right
😂
frrr
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Well

[prabipyakurel]

rn
But

than

,

The
music
is
good
[sskarz]
makes
me
think
of
you
,
and
it
made
me
happy
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
A
lot
of
songs
make
me
think
of
you
now
Before
I
was
like
single
and
alone
and
just
vibes
to
the
rhythm
but
now
I
listen
to
the
same
music
and
you
come
to
mind
It
’
s
a
really
good
feeling
❤
️
[sskarz]
OMG
speaking
of
single
and
alone
😂
I
remember
when
I
was
talking
to
you
one
time
,
and
you
said
,
"
oh
yeah
i
'
m
living
my
best
life
being
single
"
and
i
was
like
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
its
doomed
😂
right
here
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
omg
that
’
s
because
I
had
to
wait
if
you
were
the
one
I
can
’
t
just
say
I
am
taken
when
I
thought
that
only
I
loved
you
I
needed
to
be
sure
❤
️
[sskarz]
hahaha
no
I
totally
get
it
,
I
just
remember
being
like
nooooooooooooooo
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Would
you
have
liked
it
better
if
I
had
said
“
no
I
am
living
the
best
life
with
my
boyfriend
”
That
better
[sskarz]
oh
the
way
i
would
'
ve
just
*
faded
away
*
u
wouldn
'
t
have
seen
me
after
that
day
lmao
🫠
[prabipyakurel]
Lmao
And
you
would
have
believed
me
that
someone
like
me
would
have
been
dating
someone
Have
you
let
my
family
and
their
suspicions
[sskarz]
uhhhhhhh
who
wouldn
'
t
want
to
be
dating
you
first
of
all
lady
i
just
had
to
snatch
you
before
anyone
else
could
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
reminded
me
I
think
there
is
this
one
dude
that
likes
me
From
sg
,
goes
to
ucla
and
the
way
he
talks
sometimes
is
like
It
makes
me
question
things
[sskarz]
ooooooooooooooooh
dramaaaaaaaaaaaaa
jk
jk
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Like
he
uses
🥰
emoji
[sskarz]
oh
hmmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
to
think
about
that
last
time
[sskarz]
no
yeah
unless
he
'
s
like
,
swinging
the
other
way
in
terms
of
sexuality
,
i
think
ur
right
lol
[prabipyakurel]
And
dw
you
did
❤
️
No
and
I
think
if
you
look
at
my
recent
insta
post
,
under
the
name
avocado
or
something
,
he
reacted
with
those
emojis
[sskarz]
oh
fr
?
he
might
be
gay
tho
,
i
know
some
gay
friends
and
they
use
that
emoji
around
their
friends
that
are
girls
so
idk
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
he
is
not
gay
I
have
gay
friends
and
they
do
not
talk
like
that
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
then
maybe
he
does
have
a
crush
lol
you
know
that
also
reminds
me
of
something
when
we
used
to
talk
like
in
the
early
stage
,
we
talked
one
time
on
instagram
,
and
when
i
said
bye
to
you
after
talking
to
you
,
you
sent
me
like
a
heart
emoji
and
at
the
time
i
was
like
,
wait
am
i
looking
at
this
right
?
i
spent
like
20
minutes
staring
at
that
emoji
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
okay
,
let
me
explain
,
I
remember
I
thought
that
when
you
press
on
the
heart
,
more
emojis
pop
up
and
I
was
going
to
use
bye
,
but
then
it
just
sent
and
I
didn
’
t
know
how
to
unsend
.
😭
[sskarz]
LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[prabipyakurel]
I
fr
thought
you
would
have
stopped
talking
to
me
after
that
[sskarz]
no
no
i
was
like
,
WOAH
this
is
my
chance
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
but
that
heart
went
out
to
you
and
I
was
happy
[sskarz]
i
was
like
calculating
about
how
i
should
respond
back
but
then
i
was
like
,
nah
i
just
gotta
send
it
back
,
take
the
risk
one
of
the
scariest
moments
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
God
you
don
’
t
even
know
,
I
sent
that
and
I
was
like
“
shit
”
😂
[sskarz]
i
had
a
feeling
it
was
a
mistake
but
like
i
couldn
'
t
pass
up
the
opportunity
in
case
it
was
intentional
and
then
the
entire
heart
reacting
started
i
paid
attention
to
every
detail
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
I
wish
you
could
see
the
way
you
talked
to
me
and
how
I
felt
through
my
shoes
.
I
was
like
in
love
with
everything
you
said
And
like
literally
kept
every
word
in
my
heart
[sskarz]
Awwwwwwwwwwwww

'
re
just
the
SWEETEST
UGH

️

u
not
just
be
perfect
for
once
like

😂
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
It
all
seems
so
obvious
now
like
if
I
read
back
the
texts
[sskarz]
ik
but
u
know
it
was
still
scary
[prabipyakurel]
You

I
stand
by
that
No

are
perfect
.
[sskarz]

that
'
s
u
and
all
u
[prabipyakurel]
Hell
yeah
it
was
,
you
were
responsible
and
like
teaching
and
everything
so
when
you
texted
me
I
would
always
be
like
,
what
if
I
am
disturbing
him
.
And
sometimes
I
would
be
like
,
am
I
forcing
him
to
talk
to
me
.
[sskarz]

'
re
never
disturbing
me

[prabipyakurel]
Well

after
I

At

that
'
s
a
promise
[prabipyakurel]
Promise
from
me
too
:
)
Damn
,
how
did
I
ever
manage
to
land
you
.
It
’
s
wild
.
[sskarz]
THAT
'
S
WHAT
IM
SAYINGGGGGGGGGGG
❤
️
to
myself
,
about
you
like
actually
how
all
my
calculations
were
wrong
,
apparently
i
'
ve
got
a
shot
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
guess
you
and
I
both
did
It
was
destined
you
know
,
it
was
the
real
definition
of
love
at
first
sight
😊
❤
️
[sskarz]
you
know
i
never
believed
in
that
,
till
i
met
you
like
now
it
all
makes
sense
took
a
bit
to
get
here
,
but
i
knew
from
the
first
day
i
saw
you
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
made
sense
when
I
met
you
too
Because
before
I
saw
you
and
someone
said
that
I
would
be
like
“
what
love
,
who
love
,
where
love
,
HOW
love
?”
😂
[sskarz]
no
but
fr
tho
finding
love
right
now
was
like
nowhere
near
part
of
my
primary
goals
but
hey
,
its
the
best
thing
so
im
so
glad
this
happened
also
just
ticked
off
my
bucket
list
item
:
find
your
someone
that
loves
and
understands
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
They
way
this
happened
and
when
it
did
happen
,
I
am
telling
you
I
wanted
to
just
scream
it
out
my
window
and
say
your
name
.
My
bucket
list
just
said
”
find
the
one
”
and
I
did
❤
️
[sskarz]
oh
you
'
ve
got
no
idea
,
i
was
in
a
call
with
my
friends
and
i
wanted
to
just
scream
into
my
mic
we
'
re
one
step
closer
to
completing
our
lists
haha
👍
[prabipyakurel]
When
you
were
telling
me
you
liked
me
,
you
were
on
a
call
?
😂
[sskarz]
yeahhhhh
i
just
had
them
on
for
white
noise
and
i
wasn
'
t
expecting
all
of
that
to
happen
that
night
i
literally
left
the
call
the
second
it
started
getting
serious
💀
i
had
to
like
focus
up
and
think
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
lol
could
have
just
let
them
hear
you
panicking
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
mean
i
was
just
silent
,
and
then
i
left
so
they
have
no
clue
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
like
you
sent
me
the
riddle
and
when
I
said
I
had
an
idea
,
you
went
,”
now
I
am
scared
you
might
know
the
answer
”
[sskarz]
YEAHHHHHHH
literally
that
point
i
was
like
,
wait
hold
on
what
is
going
onnnnnnnnnn
[prabipyakurel]
😂
you
send
ME
the
riddle
and
you
started
freaking
out
I
was
like
dying
mentally
here
[sskarz]
no
no
because
i
couldn
'
t
tell
if
you
were
disappointed
or
like
happy
with
whatever
you
thought
it
was
so
i
was
like
wait
this
was
a
mistake
💀
i
was
like
whyyyyyy
didn
'
t
i
just
say
i
liked
her
,
why
am
i
such
a
dumbass
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
was
not
,
I
didn
’
t
even
think
about
battle
ship
,
I
just
translated
the
last
sentence
and
understood
within
5
min
😂
You
are
not
one
,
tho
I
will
let
you
know
at
times
if
you
act
like
one
😂
But
after
I
had
a
guess
it
was
me
,
you
know
from
how
you
talk
to
me
everyday
and
stuff
,
I
just
had
to
be
sure
[sskarz]
yeah
true
true
i
doubted
myself
a
lot
about
how
you
felt
about
me
so
that
'
s
why
i
was
like
edging
the
answer
😂
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
are
the
worst
at
giving
hints
😭
Let
me
just
put
that
out
there
[sskarz]
LMAO
[prabipyakurel]
You
seriously
copied
me
[sskarz]
i
intentioally
made
them
like
it
made
no
sense
well
yeah
you
weren
'
t
giving
any
useful
information
either
💀
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
said
any
other
letter
in
your
name
,
it
would
have
probably
given
it
away
SANSKAR
A
is
the
safe
one
😂
[sskarz]
that
is
hilarioussssss
well
like
at
the
same
time
wtf
am
i
supposed
to
know
with
the
letter
A
like
u
think
there
exists
a
name
that
i
know
without
the
letter
A
everyone
has
one
😂
[prabipyakurel]
John
,
bob
,
Tom
,
Joseph
,
Jose
,

Im

thinking
…
[sskarz]
💀

'
t
no
way

like
i
know
a
single
white
person
at
all
like
actually
,
i
don
'
t
have
a
single
person
that
is
just
white
wild
to
think
about
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl
me

[sskarz]
i
'
ve
only
gone
to
schools
that
are
predominantly
people
of
color
and
rarely
any
white
people
im
not
being
racist
,
just
pointing
out
statistics
that
is
all
[prabipyakurel]
No
trust
me
all
of
my
friends
are
anything
but
white
[sskarz]
im
good
with
white
people
,
just
clearing
my
name

😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
So
my
friend
Donovan
,
he
is
Mexican
but
he
is
so
white
and
back
in
5th
grade
when
I
first
met
him
when
we
were
playing
handball
,
I
went
up
and
asked
,
are
you
white
.
The
look
he
gave
me
.
I
tell
him
about
that
incident
to
this
day
and
it
’
s
hilarious
😂
[sskarz]
💀

'
s

of
my
friends

❤
️
I
literally
just
woke
up
haha
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
took
me
a
while
to
fall
asleep
but
yes
it
was
on
of
those
sleep
with
no
dreams
lol
Sorry
,
did
I
wake
you
up
?
[sskarz]
No
no
you
didn
’
t
lol
I
just
saw
your
text
first
thing
when
I
woke
up
,
feels
good
❤
️
Yeah
same
,
I
only
slept
at
like
1
am
Couldn
’
t
sleep
till
then
[prabipyakurel]
1
omg
I
slept
probably
around
11
:
30
to
12
Just
had
to
stare
at
the
ceiling
for
a
while
You
know
,
the
daily
routine
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
I
had
one
of
the
mini
insomniac
nights
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
do
you
also
toss
and
turn
when
you
can
’
t
sleep
?
[sskarz]
I
was
so
tired
,
yet
my
body
was
like
nah
we
can
’
t
sleep
rn
Yeahhh
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
that
happens
,
and
it
’
s
really
annoying
Glad
I
am
not
the
only
one
,
I
like
move
so
much
,
and
change
sleeping
positions
and
all
and
still
can
’
t
fall
asleep
when
I
need
to
.
[sskarz]
Haha
yeah
it
just
be
like
that
sometimes
Usually
I
can
sleep
in
a
matter
of
like
5
minutes
But
there
are
those
nights
where
it
’
s
really
hard
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
ever
try
just
shutting
your
eyes
for
a
super
long
time
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
for
like
10
minutes
,
and
if
that
doesn
’
t
work
then
I
just
start
watching
some
boring
YouTube
video
in
hopes
I
fall
asleep
from
that
lol
That
’
s
basically
what
I
did
last
night
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
but
yea
take
care
of
yourself
,
um
maybe
try
something
different
with
your
routine
to
help
.
[sskarz]
Only
happens
once
in
a
while
dw
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
ok
,
also
do
you
sleep
with
the
lights
on
,
like
a
little
night
light
or
do
you
need
it
pitch
black
?
[sskarz]
I
sleep
with
the
lights
off
,
but
I
have
a
small
night
light
that
barely
illuminates
,
but
it
’
s
enough
for
me
to
not
bump
into
anything
if
I
got
up
😂
Wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
I
see
,
I
need
darkness
,
I
cannot
even
have
like
a
little
bright
light
from
anywhere
Like
you
know
sometimes
like
this
random
thing
in
your
room
is
giving
off
like
a
little
dot
of
light
,
no
I
cover
that
thing
all
the
way
[sskarz]
Oh
damn
,
what
if
you
’
re
getting
light
from
like
a
window
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
mean
I
can
still
fall
asleep
with
lights

fast
Window

[sskarz]
Ohh

gotcha
Yeah
I
’
ve
gotta
be
like
dead
tired
to
sleep
with
lights
on
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
otherwise
it
’
s
difficult
But
like
sometimes
I
occasionally
wake
up
after
nightmares
and
I
will
just
be
walking
around
my
room
trynna
find
the
light
switch
That
’
s
the
only
time
I
actually
kind
of
get
scared
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm

[sskarz]
Woah
that
’
s
cool
Feels
like
I
’
m
back
in
Rome
lol
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
pretty
to
look
at
But
the
way
I
pass
this
building
to
get
to
my
11
:
00
class
from
a
class
that
ends
at
10
:
59
,
it
’
s
crazy
!
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
was
gonna
mention
that
the
other
day
,
do
u
just
get
there
late
?
No
way
you
can
get
there
in
1
min
😂
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
Berkeley
time
here
which
is
when
the
class
starts
10
min
later
then
the
said
time
so
students
and
professors
can
get
there
in
time
.
[sskarz]
Ohhh
okay
that
is
nice
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
if
the
class
extends
just
2
min
past
10
,
it
’
s
the
worst
walk
over
there
[sskarz]
I
can
imagine
lol
,
the
campus
is
huge
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
the
time
of
the
week
where
I
drink
the
most
water
😂
Are
you
back
from
the
gym

initial
question
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh

s
so
cute
,
that
’
s
what
I
always
said
to
my
friend
Yvonne
when
I
hug
her
.
[sskarz]
My
day
was
good
,
just
had
one
class
and
then
had
the
ACM
general
meeting
and
that
went
well
,
came
home
and

to
work
on
some
hw
,
then
played
a
game
with
some
of
my
friends
,
and

im
here
lol
she

haha
[prabipyakurel]

will
always
stick
to
you
like
glue
too
❤
️
[sskarz]
wbu
?
how
was
ur
day
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okay
,
that
’
s
sounds
pretty
good
,
and
the
only
reason
I
asked
if
you
were
okay
is
because
I
thought
you
were
in
trouble
or
something
.
Didn
’
t
think
of
anything
else
.
❤
️
❤
️
It
was
normal
as
usual
,
nothing
too
interesting
.
I
have
a
new
sociology
project
and
for
the
other
2
classes
I
did
notes
.
That
’
s
pretty
much
it
.
Yea
I
will
go
check
out
the
university
library
tomorrow
.
Watch
me
get
lost
in
there
😂
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
but
getting
lost
int
he
library
is
the
best
I
spend
like
all
my
time
not
in
classes
in
a
library
lol
[prabipyakurel]
How
studious
,
love
it
.
🧑
‍
🎓
Yea
it
seems
very
peaceful
in
there
We
shall
see
tomorrow
!
[sskarz]
yeahh
,
has
AC
to
keep
you
from
the
heat
,
and
also
you
probably
have
study
rooms
that
you
can
rent
rent
with
time
not
money
i
mean
lol
that
'
s
what
i
do
,
every
week
i
book
out
a
study
room
for
my
friends
and
i
and
we
just
chill
there
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
ik
ik
,
yea
it
looks
so
pretty
from
the
outside
,
I
am
really
eager
to
see
what
they
got
in
there
.
Pretty
smart
,
you
all
gather
and
play
Nintendo
or
something
?
[sskarz]
hahaha
well
one
of
my
friends
likes
to
bring
his
nintendo
switch
and
my
friends
play
on
it
,
i
sometimes
play
but
im
not
a
big
fan
of
those
kinds
of
games
lol
*
mostly
cuz
im
terrible
but
yk
😂
*
send
a
video
or
something
,
i
wanna
seeeeeeee
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
trust
me
I
got
no
idea
how
any
,
I
MEAN
ANY
,
video
games
works
Mhm
for
sure
,
lol
I
will
give
you
a
short
tour
[sskarz]
you
'
ve
never
played
a
video
game
ever
?
fr
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
tried
this
one
time
and
gave
up
in
2
min
😂
Don
’
t
remember
what
it
was
Or
where
or
when
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
'
s
fair
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
I
played
a
car
game
at
my
cousins
and
he
laughed
at
me
the
entire
time
That
probably
doesn
’
t
count
The
controller
is
so
difficult
[sskarz]
ah
you
just
don
'
t
have
enough
experience
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Or
maybe
that
yea
But
like
idk
it
never
really
caught
my
attention
in
any
way
[sskarz]
probably
not
for
you
then
i
couldn
'
t
say
the
same
for
me
tho
lol
,
i
started
playing
when
i
was
really
young
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
I
remember
Those
YouTube
videos
😂
[sskarz]
nowadays
i
don
'
t
play
as
much
,
but
sometimes
i
like
to
play
with
some
of
my
buddies
oh
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
it
’
s
okay
to
play
once
in
a
while
Remember
I
played
it
in
front
of
you
when
you
came
over
to
our
old
house
and
you
said
something
about
pumpkin
head
and
stuff
With
that
high
voice
lol
[sskarz]
oh
dw
i
wiped
it
from
my
memory
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
still
got
it
in
mine
I
’
m
ngl
after
you
showed
me
the
YouTube
channel
,
I
went
though
some
and
they
were
hilarious
[sskarz]
yeah
its
fun
when
i
'
ve
done
everything
else
i
'
ve
needed
to
do
,
otherwise
the
stress
of
the
other
stuff
kills
me
[prabipyakurel]
Just
mini
Sanskar
narrating
what
was
happening
[sskarz]
oh
terrible
terrible
terrible
my
voice
was
so
damn
high
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
that
’
s
completely
normal
You
sounded
like
an
expert
tho
[sskarz]
ah
hmmmmmm
yes
i
was
like
11
year
old
and
dumb
as
hell
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
sounded
so
adorable
You
were
not
dumb
,
2
years
later
you
got
the
Microsoft
certification
thing
,
you
were
not
dumb
lol
[sskarz]
wait
until
you
realize
i
only
started
learning
a
year
before
i
got
that
cert
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
but
you
were
far
from
dumb
,
maybe
you
saw
yourself
that
way
because
you
have
grown
now
,
but
I
am
sure
your
mind
was
just
as
sharp
.
Now
I
wanna
hear
your
voice
but
like
from
10
years
ago
😂
[sskarz]
you
'
re
really
just
the
sweetest
,
i
appreciate
your
optimism
😂
❤
️

would
love
to
hear
you
from
10
years
ago

high
was
your
voice
?
or
when
did
your
voice
come
in
?
[prabipyakurel]

️
Honestly
I

no
idea

,
I
think
I
I
have
been
told
I
sound
the
same
I
don
’
t
really
know
,
lol
but
I
sound
uglier
now
probably
then
when
I
was

here
,
10
/
10

[prabipyakurel]
Short

[sskarz]
Brb
sister
is
talking
to
me
👍
Ok
I
’
m

That
took
a
while
,
she
just
had
some
interesting
boy
stories
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
Were
they
good
boy
stories
or
like
no
?
[sskarz]
She
just
needed
my
perspective
on
stuff
as
a
guy
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
I
see
[sskarz]
There
’
s
this
guy
at
her
hospital
and
he
’
s
a
nurse
that
flirts
with
her
,
but
she
didn
’
t
realize
it
till
I
pointed
stuff
out
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwww
omg
[sskarz]
I
’
m
like
:
oh
yeah
of
course
he
likes
u
,
it
’
s
textbook
(
me
who
didn
’
t
know
you
liked
me
even
from
the
most
obvious
shit
in
the
world
)
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
is
she
okay
with
you
sharing
?
[sskarz]
Yeah

is
our
dynamic
haha
We

this
all
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

😂
That
’
s
adorable
,
you
don
’
t
know
how
to
read
any
hints
I

😂
[sskarz]
So
anyways
yeah
that
’
s
basically
how
it
went
,
and
I
was
just
like
in
my
head
,
you
know
if
I
said
this
stuff
to
prabi
,
she
would
know
I
liked
her
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
,
if
you
let
her
reads
out
previous
texts
She
would
probably
slap
you
as
to
why
you
didn
’
t
realize
before
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Like
if
I
said
:
oh
yeah
I
would
’
ve
noticed
you
in
a
crowded
room
,
do
you
think
you
would
’
ve
known
I
liked
you
Omg
we
need
to
just
never
tell
her
ever
about
how
I
confessed
The
way
I
would
get
laughed
at
for
the
rest
of
my
life
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
once
we
tell
we
tell
her
all
of
it
I
will
at
least
if
you
don
’
t
,
yk
So
she
can
laugh
at
you
Typical
sibling
thing
[sskarz]
Oh
noooooooooooo
It
’
s
doomed
😭
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
not
,
you
are
fine
,
it
was
the
cutest
thing
[sskarz]
I
still
feel
embarrassed
thinking
about
it
haha
[prabipyakurel]
You
wouldn
’
t
,
I
’
m
too
tiny
😂
[sskarz]
LMAO
no
no
that
’
s
not
what
I
meant
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No
hey
,
that
was
one
of
the
best
nights
when
you
explained
the
poem
and
confessed
,
I
loved
it
❤
️
???
[sskarz]
I
mean
like
a
guy
says
that
when
they
think
you
’
re
beautiful
Not
to
compare
heights
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
do
they
?
Yea
that
’
s
a
pretty
sweet
thing
to
say
tho
[sskarz]
And
the
guy
said
that
to
swezna
and
she
was
like
,
is
that
flirting
,
so
I
wondered
if
I
said
that
to
u
,
would
u
think
I
was
flirting
with
u
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
hmmmm
,
maybe
yes
[sskarz]
Just
to
see
a
girls
perspective
yk
ah
okay
okay
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
’
s
like
maybe
maybe
[sskarz]
Yeah
see
that
’
s
the
thing
😂
As
a
guy
,
it
’
s
obvious
because
that
’
s
like
textbook
for
flirting
with
a
girl
But
a
girl
wouldn
’
t
be
so
sure
Pretty
interesting
actually
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
you
right
you
right
,
we
’
ll
did
he
say
anything
else
?
Maybe
he
likes
her
.
[sskarz]
In
short
yeah
,
which
all
from
a
guys
perspective
it
looks
like
he
likes
her
But
she
wasn
’
t
so
sure
He
’
s
said
and
done
stuff
and
I
’
m
like
,
yeah
I
wouldn
’
t
do
that
to
any
of
my
friends
that
are
girls
that
I
have
no
attraction
to
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhh
omg
then
maybe
he
likes
her
Huh
maybe
we
should
tell
her
about
us
soon
,
just
her
tho
[sskarz]
Definitely
does
,
to
the
point
that
MULTIPLE
coworkers
said
it
out
loud
to
her
face
and
she
wasn
’
t
convinced
😂
That
’
s
all
up
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
She
should
look
into
it
,
but
like
I
am
no
expert
so
tell
her
to
be
careful
.
I
mean
does
she
like
the
dude
back
in
anyway
?
[sskarz]
No
💀
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
think
about
it
👍
😂
well
[sskarz]
Yeah
and
she
kinda
got
in
this
hole
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
,
well
there
are
ways
to
let
boys
down
softly
yk
[sskarz]
I
bet
that
the
guy
would
confess
or
try
a
move
in
the
next
2
weeks
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
Possibly
[sskarz]
So
glad
I
’
m
not
on
that
end
of
the
stick
🙏
[prabipyakurel]
Or
maybe
he
is
shy
like
you
and
just
like
to
annoy
them
with
hints
and
stuff
Ah
no
trust
me
you
are
fine
,
I
am
glad
you
aren
’
t
the
one
I
had
to
do
that
to
.
[sskarz]
Could
be
,
but
let
’
s
be
honest
a
26
year
old
me
would
probably
be
a
little
more
straight
to
the
face
than
rn
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Anyone
else
that
confesses
,
they
will
hear
how
I
let
them
down
.
Dw
you
will
get
to
that
age
too
,
we
will
see
You
about
to
turn
20
[sskarz]
No
but
fr
😭
Hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Jk
jk
Dude
,
do
you
trust
me
You
will
be
FINE
[sskarz]
With
all
my
heart
I
do
If
you
told
me
to
jump
off
a
cliff
and
you
said
it
’
d
be
good
for
me
,
off
the
cliff

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
Nah

I
would
never
tell
you
to
do
that
,
I
will
jump
off
for
you
[sskarz]
I
honestly
could
give
less
of
a
shit
of
becoming
20
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
know
you
are
💀
[sskarz]
No
no
I
’
m
holding
onto
you
forever
,
you

re
not
jumping
no
cliff

[prabipyakurel]
There

Sanskar

[prabipyakurel]

️
I

it
for
a
second
time

notice
what
it

💀
😂
Dw

️

prabi

my
love
for
you
simply
outweighs
yours
for
me
It
’
s
basic
math
really
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
okay
,
both
is
equal
,
because
I
cannot
even
tell
you
how
much
love
I
got
for
you
and
what
my
heart
feels
for
you
.
You

everyday
and

️

[prabipyakurel]
Well

even
harder
for
you
[sskarz]
No

thing

Hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
such
thing
😂
[sskarz]
I
’
m
honestly
so
happy
to
be
your
partner
,
I
really
couldn
’
t
ask
for
anyone
better
[prabipyakurel]
Me
neither
,
like
I
said
god
didn
’
t
let
me
follow
any
of
my
crushes
because
I
was
meant
to
be
yours
❤
️
❤

Dw
you
stuck

me
forever
♾

[sskarz]
And
I

️
❤
️
HELL
YEAHHHHHHHH
I

yay
:)
❤
️
Sounds
like
a
blast
ngl
Ok
but
wait
I
don
’
t
think
I
’
ve
ever
asked
you
this
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
be
❤
️
❤
️
[sskarz]
Would
you
rather
live
for
eternity
,
or
would
you
rather
live
for
a
shortened
life
I
ask
a
lot
of
friends
this
question
and
the
answers
are
always
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
Short
normal
like
with
the
people
I
love
(
including
you
).
I
feel
like
what
is
the
point
of
eternity
when
all
you
can
find
is
in
front
of
you
.
When
you
have
people
you
love
and
friends
around
you
,
just
a
happy
life
to
the
fullest
is
the
best
.
I
would
not
want
to
live
forever
.
Short
and
sweet
,
especially
now
that
I
have
you
.
What
about
you
?
[sskarz]
literally
the
exact
same
answer
as
you
❤
️
I
wouldn
’
t
change
a
thing
,
I
’
d
rather
spend
my
last
days
with
you
then
to
live
eternally
for
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
No
don
’
t
talk
like
that
,
I
cannot
even
imagine
losing
you
in
anyway
Eternity
is
nothing
without
people
you
love
❤
️
[sskarz]
There
’
s
no
point
of
living
for
eternity
if
for
no
emotions
.
Life
is
about
feeling
emotions
,
and
once
you
take
that
away
,
there
’
s
no
more
reason
to
live
You
won
’
t
ever
lose
me
,
trust
me
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
how
I
feel
,
yea
like
people
say
you
only
live
once
for
a
reason
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
also
what
would
you
do
if
you
lived
for
an
eternity
Like
,
you
probably
experienced
everything
the
universe
has
to
offer
at
some
point
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
I
lived
forever
or
others
too
?
[sskarz]
Just
you
[prabipyakurel]
No
nothing
,
I
wouldn
’
t
do
anything
,
I
would
think
about
everything
I
had
and
go
insane
thinking
about
it
No
no
this
short
life
is
good
With
you
and
family
and
friends
[sskarz]
I
agree
,
this
life
is
too
good
to
give
up
when
I
have
an
amazing
girlfriend
and
an
amazing
family
,
friends
❤
️
The
gifts
that
don
’
t
stop
giving
Sometimes
I
think
about
how
life
has
been
treating
me
so
well
,
and
like
when
is
karma
going
to
catch
up
and
smack
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
think
about
that
too
,
I
know
you
will
always
be
with
me
,
but
with
everything
school
wise
that
have
been
going
well
,
I
feel
like
it
will
all
come
down
and
hit
me
somewhere
to
the
point
where
I
won
’
t
be
able
to
pick
my
self
up
anymore
.
But
dw
no
karma
will
come
for
you
🙏
[sskarz]
You
let
me
know
when
you
feel
down
,
and
I
will
lift
you
back
up
,
no
matter
what
it
takes
And
no
bad
karma
for
you
either
,
only
the
good
kind
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
always
let
you
know
first
,
you
always
know
what
to
say
.
You
let
me
know
too
if
anything
is
ever
bothering
you
.
I
will
give
you
a
virtual
hug
and
talk
you
through
it
.
❤
️
Life
is
treating
you
well
for
a
reason
,
you
have
a
beautiful
soul
.
[sskarz]
Dw
I
know
,
I
’
ll
always
come
to
you
❤
️
Awwwww
you
’
re
so
nice
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
U

[sskarz]
Well
I
just
wanted
to
say
that
you

the
best
person
I

honestly
Thank
you
for
coming
to
my
house
,
and
letting
me
get
to
know
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Sanskar
you
are
literally
like
a
blessing
for
me
,
I
am
so
glad
I
came
to
your
house
that
evening
.
Because
I
if
I
didn

t
,
where
in
the
world
would
I
have
found
such
a
perfect
boy
for
me
.
❤

[sskarz]
You

re
just
as
perfect
for
me
,

in
every
aspect

But

little
idiot
,
I
am
back
,
hope
you
weren
’
t
asleep
yet
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
did
not
see
that
coming
😂
how
was
your
club
meeting
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
it
was
like
an
info
session
for
the
Berkeley
mock
trial
team
,
but
I
don
’
t
think
I
have
the
mental
power
to
take
on
that
club
now
as
a
freshmen
so
it
will
be
like
a
later
thing
.
Also
the
auditions
are
this
week
and
I
chose
to
come
to
LA
and
see
you
instead
of
staying
here
for
that
audition
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
awww
it
'
s
okay
,
you
'
ll
get
your
chance
again
what
is
the
berkeley
mock
trial
team
?
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
where
you
basically
become
attorneys
and
witnesses
and
perform
a
case
given
to
you
You
compete
and
stuff
[sskarz]
whaaaaaaaaaa
that
'
s
so
cool
and
you
'
re
missing
that
to
come
to
LA
?
Now
I
feel
bad
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
last
thing
I
wanna
do
this
year
is
put
so
much
pressure
on
myself
with
everything
else
on
top
of
it
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
guess
that
'
s
true
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
not
at
all
,
the
time
commitment
is
crazy
too
,
I
promise
it
’
s
not
like
that
,
it
is
the
time
commitment
of
a
4
unit
course
I
can
’
t
do
that
I
will
do
it
next
year
when
I
get
in
the
hang
of
everything
❤
️
[sskarz]
absolutely
!
❤
️
that
sounds
like
an
amazing
opportunity
to
get
experience
in
and
your
resume
would
really
stand
out
[prabipyakurel]
Meh
I
will
get
there
,
dw
,
and
never
feel
bad
lol
I
got
this
!
❤
️
At
least
until
now
[sskarz]
I
know
you
do
,
you
'
re
my
little
genius
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
yes
lol
you
the
big
genius
So
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
ugh
today
was
a
sloggggggggggggggggggggggggg
so
basically
i
had
a
class
at
11
am
,
and
i
had
already
done
all
the
assignments
for
that
day
before
the
class
so
i
did
nothing
in
class
.
Then
my
next
class
was
supposed
to
be
at
like
3
,
but
that
got
cancelled
.
So
I
had
to
stay
like
5
hours
doing
nothing
to
my
next
class
,
in
which
we
did
literally
nothing
in
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
So
it
was
just
like
a
whatever
type
of
day
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
you
hung
out
with
friends
tho
during
that
time
no
[sskarz]
i
have
never
been
so
unproductive
expecting
to
be
productive
in
my
life
lol
everyone
was
in
class
and
there
was
no
one
😭
i
just
sat
in
the
library
listening
to
music
and
watching
youtube
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
lol
I
would
say
you
could
have
talked
to
me
but
I
was
also
in
class
lolz
So
what
time
did
you
come
home
?
That
’
s
a
awkward
feeling
[sskarz]
yeah
haha
,
I
was
tempted
to
but
again
,
I
don
'
t
want
to
hinder
your
studies
at
all
really
is
,
I
just
waited
for
something
the
entire
day
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
would
never
,
I
know
you
won
’
t
!!!
❤
️
[sskarz]
and
did
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
tho
,
you
gave
yourself
a
free
day
It
is
a
day
to
clear
your
head
Think
of
it
like
that
[sskarz]
I
know
I
know
but
I
have
respect
for
you
and
this
is
the
promise
I
hold
for
you
How
can
I
clear
my
head
if
there
was
nothing
there
to
begin
with
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Love
you
for
that
,
same
here
,
I
promise
to
never
get
in
your
way
,
I
will
be
in
your
heart
for
moral
support
.
Damn
,
then
it
was
a
free
day
for
you
Think
of
it
as
a
rest
day
after
your
time
at
the
gym
[sskarz]
You
will
never
get
in
my
way
ever
love
,
but
I
appreciate
you
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
I
knew
how
this
day
would
go
,
I
would
'
ve
just
done
leg
day
so
I
could
sleep
in
school
from
exhaustion
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
this
week
has
gone
by
so
slow
[sskarz]
omg
fr
I
'
m
just
counting
the
days
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
but
it
’
s
fine
,
don
’
t
over
exercise
just
because
you
got
the
time
,
sometimes
just
sitting
is
all
you
need
Mark
the
date
[sskarz]
I
'
m
always
within
my
healthy
limits
dw
lol
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
A
day
of
sitting
in
the
library
and
YouTube
isn
’
t
going
to
hurt
you
.
You
will
probably
make
up
for
that
time
one
day
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
I
was
just
bored
out
of
my
mind
and
that
'
s
why
it
felt
like
a
slog
I
wish
I
just
went
home
early
and
joined
the
class
on
zoom
lol
In
my
last
class
,
I
literally
went
to
the
back
of
the
room
and
put
my
head
down
for
20
mins
,
I
woke
up
and
we
were
still
on
the
same
thing
that
I
had
already
done
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
but
it
’
s
fine
.
You
didn
’
t
expect
it
and
sometimes
life
does
that
Yikes
,
but
you
had
a
good
nap
I
suppose
?
[sskarz]
my
friend
woke
me
up
and
I
looked
at
the
board
,
nothing
had
changed
,
put
my
head
back
down
😂
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
a
good
friend
tho
But
that
’
s
seems
boring
ngl
[sskarz]
yep
it
was
pretty
bad
how
was
your
math
class
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
a
lot
of
help
during
office
hours
,
spent
35
min
looking
for
the
location
but
who
is
counting
that
,
and
for
the
actual
math
class
I
made
a
friend
,
in
fact
got
her
insta
so
we
can
communicate
and
I
have
a
quiz
tomorrow
.
[sskarz]
ayyyyyyy
you
made
a
friend
nice
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
so
scared
,
I
feel
like
I
know
what
to
expect
but
sometimes
I
think
about
it
and
it
’
s
like
omg
it
’
s
my
first
college
quiz
[sskarz]
oh
are
you
prepared
for
your
quiz
tomorrow
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

extra
questions
But

negative
possibilities

on
doing
your

Sounds

of
fun
haha
[prabipyakurel]

Why

you
ask
?
[sskarz]
Oh

I
was
going
to
give
you
something

but
it
might
be
a
little
suspicious
to
just
be
carrying
around
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
something
big
and
bright
?
[sskarz]
not
exactly
but
it

decent
size

little
risky
,
but

time

t

bringing
a
bag

when
we
meet
another
time
,
you

I
’
m
making
my
best
effort
to
see
you
wherever
you
decide
to
go
Oooh

I
had
another
question
for
you
Where
is
like
your
dream
place
to
vacation
in
?
[prabipyakurel]
Switzerland
And
other
random
countries
like
japan
.
Just
some
place
new
and
with
change
.
[sskarz]
Do
you
have
a
specific
place
in
Switzerland
or
just
the
country
in
general
?
[prabipyakurel]
Anywhere
Where
I
can
like
zip
line
maybe
,
eat
chocolate
and
just
enjoy
the
view
and
greenery
[sskarz]
That
sounds
really
amazing
It
looks
like
a
beautiful
country
with
green
rolling
hills
and
mountains
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
don
’
t
have
like
any
specific
places
,
I
love
visiting
random
places
Yea
I
wanna
roll
down
a
hill
too
😂
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
like
the
Berkeley
rolling
down
the
hill
for
good
luck
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
not
done
that
you
know
,
I
should
do
that
.
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
you
should
sometime
Do
you
see
people
doing
it
regularly
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
It
’
s
on
the
top
of
the
hill
where
like
the
business
school
is
and
everything
Take
25
min
to
get
there
Walking
[sskarz]
Oh
jeez
[prabipyakurel]
Uphill
,
and
it
’
s
a
really
quiet
place
,
I
would
like
someone
there
with
me
[sskarz]
Stay
safe
out
there
,
maybe
you
can
convince
one
of
your
friends
to
accompany
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
,
she
is
not
feeling
well
,
but
imma
take
that
girl
with
me
.
Omg
so
you
know
how
that
club
session
thing
was
going
on
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
it
started
at
like
8
and
finished
like
at
9
:
10
ish
And
when
I
got
out
of
the
hall
,
it
was
so
dark
,
And
I
was
like
so
scared
walking
back
The
homeless
come
out
at
night
and
I
didn
’
t
even
want
to
take
the
shortcut
so
I
came
the
long
way
and
the
entire
way
,
I
was
so
scared
.
Like
I
will
never
stay
past
8
anywhere
ever
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
you
didn
’
t
have
anyone
to
walk
with
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
walked
out
alone
There
were
others
walking
but
not
in
my
particular
direction
yk
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
get
you
It
’
s
okay
,
just
don
’
t
make
eye
contact
with
people
and
keep
your
head
straight
You
’
ll
be
just
fine
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
’
s
what
I
did
,
but
it
was
so
scary
and
all
[sskarz]
You
’
re
okay
now
,
that
’
s
what
matters
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
and
like
I
saw
homeless
everywhere
[sskarz]
Just
keep
aware
of
your
surroundings
,
and
if
you
ever
feel
threatened
or
feel
off
,
just
run
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
But
when
I
turned
to
my
unit
,
I
saw
a
few
people
and
it
felt
so
much
better
.
[sskarz]
That
’
s
good
[prabipyakurel]
No
ik
,
I
’
m
running
when
I
feel
unsafe
anywhere
.
👍
[sskarz]
Good
to
hear
.
And
trust
me
no
one
is
gonna
try
anything
❤
️
You
just
give
them
your
mean
side
and
they
’
ll
leave
you
alone
[prabipyakurel]
😂
yes
for
sure
But
yea
imma
keep
in
mind
not
to
go
out
past
8
👍
I
will
find
someone
first
and
then
go
[sskarz]
That
’
s
my
smart
girl
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

I
can
’
t
believe
I
am

s

I
would

those
words

I
won

t

And

😂
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Lol

️
[sskarz]
Dw

ve
stolen
my
heart
completely
,

And
here
I
thought
I
’
d
never
hear
those
words
come
out
of
someone
else
’
s
mouth
to
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
don
’
t
even
know
,
and
no
one
should
dare
They
keep
their
eyes
off
you
❤
️
No

that
from
me
a
LOT
❤
️
[sskarz]
You

re
just
the
sweetest
sweetheart
I
love
you
so
much
you
don
’
t
even
know
[prabipyakurel]
You

,
you
are
like
amazinger
😂
I
just
had
to
say
it
😂
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
youuuuuuuuuuuuu
,
for
ever
and
ever
and
ever
and
ever
.
❤
️
Probably
they
stare
you
are
giving
me
through
the
phone
huh
[sskarz]
UGH
saturday
could
not
come
slower
I
swear
Oh
most
definitely
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
For
reals
,
it
usually
is
like
hey
I
’
m
here
,
and
hey
I
am
going
the
next
day
,
but
like
damn
,
this
week
has
gone
so
slow
[sskarz]
Honestly
tho
At
this
point
,
if
I
have
no
other
opportunity
,
I
’
m
gonna
hug
you
in
front
of
everyone
regardless
😂
❤
️
You
just
mean
so
much
to
me
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
if
by
the
time
we
leave
I
don
’
t
get
a
chance
,
I
will
go
up
to
you
and
be
like
,
it
was
so
nice
meeting
you
see
you
soon
and
proceed
with
a
BIG
hug
.
Oh
yea
,
let
everyone
stare
and
think
😂
[sskarz]
Oh
the
next
day
would
be
WILD
haha
[prabipyakurel]
For
you
,
imma
be
out
of
town
[sskarz]
I
bet
your
family
would
just
spam
call
you
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Gonna
get
lectured
through
the
phone
for
sure
Yours
would
probably
just
laugh
it
out
or
something
.
But
you
will
look
sus
for
sure
[sskarz]
Oh
no
they
would
be
absolutely
shocked
In
a
good
way
most
likely
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
but
it
’
s
a
hug
Yk
,
maybe
it
’
s
not
so
bad
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
my
family
would
take
it
to
lengths
and
get
an
FBI
investigation
up
in
our
relationship
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yikes
😂
[sskarz]
They
would
stay
insistent
on
knowing
everything
from
that
point
forward
So
yk
it
’
s
good
it
’
s
just
us
right
now
,
let
’
s
keep
it
that
way
so
we
have
our
own
freedom
with
each
other
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
I
don
’
t
want
anyone
to
know
❤
️
If
I
am
getting
a
hug
,
I
am
getting
one
that
is
worth
it
.
So
we
will
have
to
do
something
.
[sskarz]
I
’
ve
got
a
few
ideas
[prabipyakurel]
Go
on
[sskarz]
Okay
first
idea
I
bring
up
the
idea
of
showing
you
the
car
that
I
’
m
driving
now
,
the
Tesla
,
and
we
make
an
excuse
to
go
outside
and
since
you
were
so
interested
,
you
wanted
to
see
it
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
okay
okay
[sskarz]
Second
idea
I
know
the
layout
of
kreepas
house
somewhat
,
and
I
know
that
the
second
floor
has
a
lot
of
rooms
.
We
could
just
make
an
excuse
to
go
talk
upstairs
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
it
is
at
their
house
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
assuming
so
?
Shit
unless
it
’
s
not
,
then
that
idea
won
’
t
work
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
not
sure
[sskarz]
This
is
why
I
’
ve
thought
of
several
😂
Third
idea
Uh
I
’
ll
pull
you
to
a
room
and
lock
it
,
if
literally
nothing
else
works
for
privacy
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
so
the
last
2
ideas
are
not
going
to
work
[sskarz]
Most
likely
not
haha
I
’
ve
got
no
idea
what
the
venue
is
like
either
either
at
their
house
or
some
kind
of
dinner
place
but
the
first
idea
has
some
merit
to
it
You
got
any
ideas
?
[prabipyakurel]
brother
called
and
then
mom
called
lol
[sskarz]
Haha
no
worries
Also
diamond
bar
,
damn
we
’
ll
pray
the
first
idea
works
then
haha
[prabipyakurel]
The
first
idea
might
be
it
Or
I
can
leave
something
like
lip
gloss
or
something
in
my
car
and
while
I
am
getting
that
from
dads
car
,
you
can
come
to
check
on
your
car
or
something
a
little
after
I
get
out
[sskarz]
Ohh
yeah
that
’
s
also
a
good
one
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
my
dad
be
like
,
why
do
you
need
to
get
more
lip
gloss
[sskarz]
Now
the
thing
is
,
since
it
’
s
a
hall
,
we
would
have
to
be
a
little
more
discrete
since
it
’
s
out
in
the
open
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
,
it
is
open
open
[sskarz]
I
can
just
park
in
a
dark
corner
,
no
one
would
see
lol
[prabipyakurel]
You
need
to
find
that
parking
first
😂
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
scout
the
place
dw
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
say
go
to
the
little
area
to
the
bathroom
and
hug
but
I
know
there
will
be
so
many
aunties
there
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
’
s
got
lots
of
risks
haha
What
if
someone
was
in
line
for
the
bathroom
and
we
both
came
out
💀
Instant
death
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
omg
I
don
’
t
even
want
to
imagine
No
no
Scratch
that
Burn
that
actually
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
😂
It
’
s
okay
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmmmm
[sskarz]
Whether
we
have
a
plan
or
not
We
’
re
gonna
make
it
work
[prabipyakurel]
We
will
We
have
to
Idk
when
I
will
see
you
again
,
and
imma
get
a
picture
with
you
somehow
too
[sskarz]
We
definitely
will
I
won
’
t
forget
❤
️
Hey
,
I
’
m

sleep
for
the
night
,

wake
up
early
tomorrow

❤

Imma

,
I

❤
️
[sskarz]
Goooooooooood
morning
sweetheart
,
I
’
m
also
getting
ready
so
we
’
ll
talk
afterwards
:)
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
slept
pretty
good
Wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
Like
after
I
was
done
texting
you
,
it
took
me
a
while
to
fall
asleep
and
my
leg
was
hurting
so
bad
,
I
couldn
’
t
fall
asleep
until
maybe
1
.
But
after
that
was
okay
,
I
just
got
up
in
the
morning
.
[sskarz]
Why
was
your
leg
hurting
so
badly
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
idea
honestly
,
but
it
was
just
my
right
one
and
like
nothing
would
help
[sskarz]
It
just
like
started
hurting
for
no
reason
?
Maybe
it
was
a
muscle
spasm
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
possibly
,
but
it
was
like
kind
of
annoying
because
I
couldn
’
t
stop
moving
me
feet
.
Then
I
got
up
and
pressed
it
for
a
little
and
it
slightly
went
away
and
I
think
I
slept
after
that
.
But
I
am
all
good
now
.
[sskarz]
Okay
that
’
s
good
to
hear
Try
not
to
put
too
much
stress
on
that
leg
for
today
and
see
how
you
feel
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
try
Thanks
!
❤
️
Are

to
head

gym

useful
Fr

I
’
m
messing

[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
if
you
did
it
carefully
the
first
time
it
wouldn
’
t
have
defeated
you
and
you
could
have
been
texting
me
sitting
on
that
thing
,
but
no
,
it
is
you
that
put
the
washer
in
wrong
and
messed
it
up
.
😂
[sskarz]
Aha
yeah
I
’
m
just
gonna
pretend
it
’
s
not
there
and
let
someone
else
deal
with
it
😂

[prabipyakurel]
Hopefully
yk
this
week

after

other
but
it
will
be
worth
it
because
i
will
see
you
❤
️
[sskarz]
do
you
feel
overwhelmed
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
not
say
overwhelmed
,
its
just
I
had
my
first
quiz
,
first
assigned
project
,
and
lots
of
reading
,
maybe
like
a
lot
on
my
plate
would
be
the
phrase
But
I
got
most
of
them
over
with
so
its
just
the
dance
as
of
now
[sskarz]
yeah
its
a
lot
to
take
in
,
its
still
just
your
second
week
of
college
and
you
'
re
already
off
to
do
so
many
things
at
once
,
I
bet
it
feels
really
exhausting
to
think
of
everything
at
once
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
feel
like
I
have
been
here
for
months
ngl
but
like
I
am
starting
to
get
into
the
hang
of
everything
and
I
think
it
will
be
fine
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
you
will
be
okay
,
its
just
the
learning
curve
of
everything
,
having
to
make
a
routine
around
your
schedule
and
keeping
track
of
everything
❤
️
you
'
ll
get
used
to
it
soon
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
i
will
get
there
,
also
because
you
are
here
to
motivate
me
every
once
in
a
while
,
or
very
often
actually
,
so
I
will
be
more
than
fine
.

be
possible

❤
️
[sskarz]

But

’
t
at
all
,
not

gotten
remotely
close
to
pissing
me
off
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
you
havent
either
trust
me
❤
️
[sskarz]
But
good
,
I
want
us
to
both
be
honest
with
our
feelings
with
each
other
all
the
time
It
’
ll
help
us
grow
just
that
much
more
:)
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
honesty
is
key
,
for
sure
.
hey
do
you
remember
a
while
back
when
you
went
to
the
gym
at
like
10
:
00
when
you
hadnt
confessed
yet
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
?
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
sent
me
a
picture
you
remember
?
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
Yeah
I
do
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
so
after
a
little
while
,
you
said
"
can
I
ask
why
you
dont
want
to
hang
out
",
were
you
mad
at
during
that
time
.
It
has
just
always
been
in
my
mind
[sskarz]
No
no
I
wasn
’
t
mad
,
I
was
honestly
just
confused
.
It
was
during
a
time
I
felt
the
most
confused
with
how
you
felt
about
me
and
I
just
wanted
to
know
why
you
were
feeling
that
way
So
after
that
conversation
,
I
took
a
step
back
and
reflected
upon
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
,
yea
you
were
like
"
come
to
the
gym
I
will
show
you
everyhting
you
need
to
know
"
and
I
was
like
omg
damn
.
And
then
you
said
that
and
I
was
like
"
oh
no
,
what
if
he
is
like
mad
at
me
or
something
"
[sskarz]
No
no
,
it
’
s
just
at
the
time
I
was
thinking
back
to
when
you
didn
’
t
want
to
hangout
initially
is
when
it
was
bogging
my
mind
down
.
And
I
just
needed
to
know
why
is
all
Trust
me
I
don
’
t
get
mad
easily
haha
,
I
ask
honest
questions
and
then
I
’
ll
decide
if
it
’
s
right
to
be
mad
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
,
no
no
you
it
was
right
for
you
to
ask
me
lol
,
everyime
someone
asks
to
like
go
here
or
lets
go
there
,
I
am
always
like
,
"
yea
in
the
future
"
No
I
love
you
for
that
.
Also
,
couldnt
tell
you
that
night
,
but
you
looked
cute
in
that
picture
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
got
you
,
I
’
ve
done
the
same
thing
to
other
friends
and
I
’
ve
gotten
that
answer
so
I
’
ve
always
just
stepped
back
and
kind
of
backed
off
just
to
analyze
the
situation
Awwww
thank
you
,
I
wasn
’
t
going
to
send
it
to
you
initially
but
I
felt
like
eh
,
might
as
well
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
glad
you
did
,
it
was
nice
!
Yea
and
I
was
scared
that
you
were
going
to
ask
me
to
go
somewhere
and
I
would
have
to
turn
you
down
because
my
parents
will
not
be
okay
,
especially
that
time
when
I
didnt
know
you
liked
me
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
realized
what
I
was
asking
for
wasn
’
t
realistic
so
I
let
it
go
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
get
you
,
and
thank
you
for
being
honest
and
just
asking
.
❤
️

the
gym

It

s
part
of
your
charm
and
it
makes
me
laugh
sometimes
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
makes
me
laugh

,
you
arent
alone
I
realize
it
sometimes
and
I
am
just
like
,
"
what
was
i
trynna
say
"
[sskarz]
It
really
be
like
that
,
but
I
’
m
not
gonna
pretend
like
I
don
’
t
make
the
same
amount
if
not
more
mistakes
than
you
do
💀
I
’
m
just
as
guilty
[prabipyakurel]
Aha
loser
,
remember
your
chair
situation
[sskarz]
Ahaaaaaa
screw
off
😭😭
[prabipyakurel]
yea
you
are
aha
screw

lol
[sskarz]
It
was
so
bad
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
its
okay
,
i
love
you
and
every
silly
mistake
you
make
.
❤
️
so
bad
that
now
you
decided
its
no
longer
your
problem
to
fix
[sskarz]
❤
️
It
’
s
really
not
my
problem
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
thats
so
cute
i
love
cute
gifs
there
are
so
many
cute
ones
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
I
just
found
this
one
It
’
s
adorable
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
...
you
just
gonna
let
it
sit
there
half
done
if
no
one
is
going
to
attempt
it
[sskarz]
Well
TECHNICALLY
it
is
done
…
just
not
correctly
😂
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
then
its
not
done
[sskarz]
Mmmm
but
I
could
make
the
argument
that
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
until
someone
sits
on
it
then
its
back
to
many
parts
again
[sskarz]
Well
the
thing
is
It
won
’
t
collapse
initially
But
overtime
it
will
eventually
So
like
[prabipyakurel]
yea
well
its
not
like
a
one
time
use
and
throw
thing
it
will
stay
there
for
your
entire
family
to
eventually
sit
on
no
?
[sskarz]
My
brain
on
that
thing
was
a
one
time
use
and
throw
😂
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
will
also
probably
[sskarz]
Someone
’
s
gonna
fix
it
,
eventually
[prabipyakurel]
eventually
[sskarz]
mhmmm
eventually
😂
Someone
’
s
gotta
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
sleepy

[sskarz]
Not
really

on
my
face

[sskarz]
Hey

re
sleepy
it
’
s

Ooh

[prabipyakurel]
No

sitting
still
thinking
about

[sskarz]
Why

Are

[sskarz]
Idea
#

probably
lol
And
if
not

,
an
opportunity
will
always
arise
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You

,
I
am
taking
your
sister
outside

her
about

,
and

our
picture
[sskarz]
Woah
woah
,

you
sure
?
[prabipyakurel]
Just
your
sister
I
am
thinking
about
it
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
know
I
mean
I
’
m
on
board
,
it
’
s
just
on
you

about
that
[sskarz]
I
assure
you
,
she

s
never
betrayed
me
with
anything
[prabipyakurel]
its
like
plan
X
as

now
[sskarz]
That
’
s

[prabipyakurel]
from
the
way
I

wouldnt
,
she
is
just
incredible
.
I
trust
her
as
much
as
I

you

❤
️
[sskarz]
That
’
s
good
But
let
’
s
keep
that
as
last
resort
For
your
sake
I
’
m
sure
an
opportunity
will
present
itself
during
the
entire
event
So
don
’
t
you
worry
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
like
the
last
plan
kind
of
thing
Hopefully
,
there
has
got
to
be
some
moment
where
we
can
take
a
picture
[sskarz]
There
will
be
,
and
I
’
ll
let
you
know
when
that
opportunity
comes

and
seeing
you
[sskarz]
Literally

[prabipyakurel]
It

’
re
just
on
a
stool
then
😂
Jk
jk
jk
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
reminds
me
,
when
you
and
your
family
came
over
last
time
um
your
mom
was
like
can
i
have
water
and
the
glass
is
on
the
cupboard
(
you
were
upstairs
during
this
time
),
and
I
need
thr
foot
stool
to
reach
the
cuboard
and
when
she
asked
me
I
could
not
reach
it
.
I
was
like
"
omg
im
so
sorry
lol
,
then
I
got
the
foot
stool
from
the
living
room
and
gave
her
the
glass
.
I
was
dying
,
I
just
couldnt
get
up
there
😂
[sskarz]
Omg
you
should
’
ve
just
called
me
over
haha
I
could
’
ve
helped
[prabipyakurel]
right
,
imma
just
scream
your
name
upstairs
and
be
like
"
hey
love
I
cant
reach
the
cupboard
,
do
you
mind
?"
💀
That
night
would
have
been
the
last
time
you
would
have
seen
me
alive
.
[sskarz]
LMAO
I
would
’
ve
just
turned
pale
white
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
would
have
stayed
up
there
forever
[sskarz]
Imagine
tho
,
that
would
’
ve
been
so
tragic
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
obviously
everyone
was
there
[sskarz]
I
’
m
gonna
keep
a
tight
knot
on
my
vocabulary
for
Saturday
I
’
m
not
letting
the
word
love
come
out
anywhere
near
anyone
else
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
,
you
cant
come
up
to
me
and
be
like
,
"
so
love
how
is
school
?"
Start
practicing
from
now
[sskarz]
“
oh
hey
honey
how
’
s
the
college
life
been
?”
Ahem
uh
hey
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
simply
just
go
under
the
table
😂
Yea
so
when
you
said
maybe
you
were
on
a
stool
,
it
just
reminded
me
of
that
time
[sskarz]
I
can
imagine
that
lol
I
hope
I
don
’
t
have
to
lean
down
to
hug
you
😂
[prabipyakurel]
usually
there
are
like
50
glasses
laying
around
in
the
kitchen
and
when
I
needed
one
,
it
was
like
"
nope
"
Maybe
a
little
[sskarz]
I
honestly
don
’
t
remember
the
last
time
you
stood
next
to
me
so
I
forgot
just
exactly
what
4
’
11
is
like
[prabipyakurel]
uh
how
tall
are
you
?
[sskarz]
5
’
10
[prabipyakurel]
damn
so
just
imagine
me
like
a
little
shorter
than
your
sister

said
she
was
5
'
1
i
think
or
5
yea
[sskarz]
Omg
okay
I
will
definitely
have
to
lean
down
a
little
haha
but
it
’
ll
be
cute
[prabipyakurel]

will
maybe
like
this
short
[sskarz]
Awwwwww
[prabipyakurel]
for
you
to
put
your
elbows
on
my
head
and
relax
[sskarz]
That
’
s
basically
us
right
there
haha
[prabipyakurel]

cats
and
dogs

👍
Cats
are
a
little
harder
to
work
with
but
I
still
love
them
[prabipyakurel]
i
also
walked
up
to
the
5th
floor
using
the
stairs
after
dinner
because
someone
walked
in
with
a
dog
and
I
was
waiting
for
the
elevator
and
I
was
like
"
nah
,
i
will
take
the
stairs
"
It
was
a
really
bad
decision
Yea
I
feel
like
they
make
more
mess
[sskarz]
You
really
are
afraid
of
dogs

Was
it

dog

Did

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

nice
,
had
a
dream
that
I
went
back
to
elementary
and
saw
everyone
,
very
weird
,
but
interesting
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Had
a
strange
dream
where
I
confronted
someone
I
didn
’
t
really
like
.
Wasn
’
t
exactly
a
nightmare
,
I
was
just
really
confused
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
confronted
them
about
what
?
[sskarz]
Well
it
was
more
like
,
why
are
you
here
and
what
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
,
and
I
didn
’
t
really
get
the
answer
to
that
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
meh
it
’
s
okay
,
it
happens
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
be
like
that
lol
You
saw
all
of
your
elementary
school
friends
?
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
yea
it
was
like
I
was
back
in
8th
grade
,
honestly
that
year
was
amazing
,
but
like
I
saw
a
good
portion
of
those
people
in
my
dreams
so
it
was
like
huh
Ngl
I
miss
a
lot
of
them
[sskarz]
That
must
’
ve
been
nice
to
see
them
again
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

was
,
one
of
them
her
name

saira

she
is
like

cutest
person
sometimes
and
I

❤
️
She

you
will
run
into
someone
I

someday
Randomly
[sskarz]
What
major

she
?
[prabipyakurel]
Uh
I
think

[sskarz]
Yeah

chance
I
’
d

There

s
too
many
people
here
to
meet
outside
of
your
own
major
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

Have

bed
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

[sskarz]
When
I

”
and

😂
That

[sskarz]
No

and
I
was
about
to
get
up
But
my
body

off
and
I

haha
[prabipyakurel]
No

I
woke
up
and
saw
your
text
and
then
woke
up
like
10
min
later
[sskarz]
Have

had
breakfast

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

brushed
,
then
went
down
stairs
,
got

and
coffee
and
brought

[sskarz]
Omg

girlfriend

I
could
never

😂
[prabipyakurel]
No

the
morning
sometimes
when
I
get
up
,
it
’
s
like
that
’
s

I
cannot
go
back
to

When

So

’
t

Trust

😂
[sskarz]

Scholar

❤
️
💯
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
not
hear
me
when
I
said
the
only
reason
I
got
up
was
so
I
could
go
get
food
😂
That
is
you
too
,
from
a
young
age
lol
,
you
were
just
brilliant
!
[sskarz]
Not
as
much
as
you

[prabipyakurel]
Noooooooo
don
’
t
use
boo
either
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhhh
I
’
m
so
sorry
I
don
’
t
like
that
one
tho
[sskarz]
Ok
ok
no
no
you
’
re
good
hahaha
Okay
okay
shorty
:)
[prabipyakurel]
There
you
go
That
’
s
more
like
it
[sskarz]
Hahaha
I
’
ll
keep
it
in
mind
dw
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
quick
question
,
how
many
alarms
do
you
have
on
your
phone
[sskarz]
Like
7
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
like
a
few
alarms
person
or
like
15
Because
I
I
got
one
every
15
min
[sskarz]
I
have
one
every
single
minute
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
that
’
s
a
reasonable
number
yet
Every
15
[sskarz]
From
6
:
30
to
6
:
45
There
is
an
alarm
for
every
minute
in
between
So
I
guess
15
[prabipyakurel]
If
we
ever
have
a
sleepover
,
this
thing
will
go
off
every
15
min
until
I
get
tired
and
get
up
[sskarz]
I
like
how
your
6
:
20
alarm
says
WAKE
UP
and
the
others
are
just
alarms
😂
You
would
get
sick
of
me
and
my
alarms
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
it
’
s
because
I
want
that
to
be
the
one
time
to
actually
get
up
if
possible
Nah
you
only
have
7
[sskarz]
15
*
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Unless
you
hit
snooze
and
it
keeps
going
off
you
know
[sskarz]
Yep
I
have
to
annoy
myself
with
alarms
to
get
up
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[sskarz]
And
even
then
,
I
really
could
just
sleep
through
it
Omg
one
time
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
do
that
,
you
are
not
alone
I
will
just
continue
to
fall
asleep
in
the
weirdest
positions
[sskarz]
I
went
to
a
MESA
conference
in
San
Diego
with
my
friend
Anthony
and
it
’
s
basically
a
place
where
you
meet
company
representatives
and
whatever
and
it
was
all
sponsored
for
us
to
go
right
.
We
were
there
for
like
3
days
,
and
Anthony
and
I
shared
a
hotel
room
with
2
beds
right
.
Every
single
morning
,
I
would
literally
have
my
alarms
ring
and
he
got
tired
of
my
shit
one
time
and
literally
turned
off
all
of
my
alarms
so
he
could
go
back
to
sleep
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
what
a
friend
.
He
was
like
this
mf
and
his
alarms
😂
[sskarz]
No
but
fr
lmao
I
woke
up
and
he
was
like
,
bro
never
ever
put
on
these
damn
alarms
again
😂
[prabipyakurel]
All
3
day
?
You
had
those
alarms
?
[sskarz]
Every
single
day
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
honestly
I
do
the
same
so
I
don
’
t
mind
,
but
yea
some
people
are
just
like
why
[sskarz]
Haha
yeah
it
could
be
worse
[prabipyakurel]
My
dad
does
that
,
so
none
of
us
sleep
with
our
doors
locked
and
because
all
of
our
rooms
are
like
in
a
row
,
when
my
alarms
goes
off
,
my
dad
across
the
hallway
can
hear
it
and
he
comes
and
goes
“
what
is
your
problem
,
huh
kati
alarm
lagako
”
euta
matra
raknu
pardaina
”
and
I
just
have
to
give
him
that
okay
baba
stare
.
😂
[sskarz]
LMAO
Your
dad
is
so
funny
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
,
and
he
be
sleeping
after
he
stops
his
one
and
only
alarm
💀
[sskarz]
One
alarm
just
doesn
’
t
cut
it
these
days
[prabipyakurel]
Like
his
alarm
rings
at
6
and
I
can
hear
him
like
stop
it
and
by
the
time
I
am
like
out
of
the
shower
,
moms
already
downstairs
and
all
,
he
is
barely
fixing
his
bed
,
and
I
give
him
that
glance
and
run
before
he
can
tell
me
anything
about
my
alarm
situation
😂
It
doesn
’
t
and
they
don
’
t
understand
[sskarz]
Like
this
mf
be
criticizing
ME
when
he
hasn
’
t
even
finished
fixing
the
bed
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Right
He
takes
his
sweet
time
Surprisingly
makes
it
everywhere
in
time
tho
I
be
moving
so
fast
and
it
feels
like
I
am
late
everywhere
[sskarz]
Lol
same
[prabipyakurel]
Your
parents
put
in
alarms
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
and
sometimes
they
forget
to
turn
it
off
so
they
go
on
for
eternity
[prabipyakurel]
Some
parents
like
my
mom
don
’
t
need
an
alarm
,
they
fr
just
wake
them
self
up
at
6
[sskarz]
They
got
their
circadian
rhythm
down
right
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
my
brother
,
he
sleeps
through
the
alarms
,
and
when
his
school
started
a
week
before
I
came
here
,
that
kid
would
set
and
alarm
to
wake
up
at
5
:
30
and
I
would
have
to
go
shut
that
think
up
and
slap
some
sense
into
him
😂
Oh
fs
[sskarz]
Why
did
he
make
an
alarm
for
so
early
in
the
morning
[prabipyakurel]
Takes
a
long
shower
Fixes
his
hair
He
just
takes
so
long
getting
ready
He
gets
ready
like
he
is
going
to
see
his
girl
at
school
💀
I
’
m
like
“
it
’
s
just
school
”
[sskarz]
I
mean
hey
,
if
I
knew
there
was
a
prabi
at
my
school
,
I
’
d
come
to
school
looking
my
best
everyday
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
ngl
,
I
kinda
wished
we
went
to
the
same
school
That
would
have
been
amazing
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
would
’
ve
been
interesting
for
sure
lol
I
’
m
glad
I
found
you
now
tho
rather
than
sooner
or
later
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
me
too
,
everything
is
working
out
[sskarz]
Yuppppp
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
later
would
have
been
too
much
of
a
gap
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
would
be
way
too
hard
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
been
like
yea
I
know
you
for
a
while
but
we
aren
’
t
that
deep
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
Perfect
timing
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
so
glad
I
found
you
right
after
high
school
That
was
amazing
So
random
but
perfect
timing
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
’
m
gonna
be
celebrating
July
4th
for
a
different
reason
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
gonna
be
so
excited
and
all
and
your
family
will
be
like
,
“
and
he
is
now
whitewashed
all
the
way
and
probably
a
patriot
”
😂
Yea
those
fireworks
signify
something
other
than
independence
for
me
❤
️
[sskarz]
My
family
knows
that
I
don
’
t
really
care
for
fireworks
that
much
,
but
they
’
re
gonna
be
surprised
when
it
comes
back
around
and
they
see
me
getting
all
hyped
up
haha
So
technically
we
have
2
things
to
celebrate
That
day
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
damn
,
yes
it
will
hit
when
that
time
comes
around
next
year
for
sure
[sskarz]
And
august
23rd
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
do
,
you
celebrate
us
and
whatever
independence
shit
😂
[sskarz]
Wait
I
didn
’
t
mean
the
independence
thing
💀
[prabipyakurel]
August
23
at
9
:
51
What
else
is
on
July
4th
[sskarz]
I
meant
like
our
anniversary
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhhhh
yea
,
you
said
2
things
?
[sskarz]
Not
July
4th
specifically
But
the
way
I
said
it
,
it
looked
like
I
was
talking
about
the
FREEDOMMMM
aspect
of
July
4th
lmao
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
that
day
will
forever
just
be
a
special
day
for
me
Like
imma
get
up
that
morning
and
be
like
fireworks
for
us
❤
️
[sskarz]
Me
too
,
we
’
ll
watch
them
together
one
day
[prabipyakurel]
One
day
[sskarz]
Who
knows
when
that
’
ll
be
😂
But
it
’
ll
happen
[prabipyakurel]
Fr
,
my
parents
and
relatives
be
planning
a
get
together
on
all
those
special
days
I
think
the
best
shot
we
have
at
meeting
is
when
our
dads
have
that
meeting
thing
that
they
take
turns
doing
[sskarz]
Meeting
thing
?
Ohhhhhhhh
for
their
company
thingy
[prabipyakurel]
For
their
company
thing
yea
[sskarz]
Yeah
yeah
true
Eh
we
’
ll
see
how
it
goes
and
go
with
the
flow
yk
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
my
dad
will
literally
look
at
me
and
be
like
“
watchu
gonna
do
there
huh
”
We
will
get
out
chances
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
this
one
time
,
it
was
a
Saturday
and
you
know
the
one
uncle
with
the
annoying
kid
that
turned
off
your
drum
set
,
yea
we
went
to
their
for
like
a
pre
dashain
celebration
and
a
meeting
thing
.
And
your
parents
were
there
and
all
too
.
And
let
me
tell
you
got
bored
I
was
,
it
was
so
obvious
that
your
dad
came
over
and
was
like
“
you
are
so
bored
right
chhori
”
you
don
’
t
know
how
much
I
wanted
to
just
come
back
home
.
I
thought
you
would
be
there
and
you
weren
’
t
and
I
was
like
damn
.
Then
your
dad
was
like
next
time
you
go
over
to
ours
when
parents
go
somewhere
and
you
can
hang
out
with
them
and
I
was
like
“
maybe
that
day
will
come
”
I
could
not
wait
to
leave
that
day
There
were
also
so
many
kids
that
day
too
[sskarz]
Omg
I
remember
I
think
it
’
s
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
like
projects
I
had
to
finish
,
and
also
I
remembered
his
little
kid
and
got
instantly
turned
off
by
that
idea
of
seeing
him
again
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
assumed
you
were
busy
.
That
little
kid
drove
me
nuts
😂
[sskarz]
No
but
fr
that
little
kid
is
so
arrogant
But
yk
he
’
s
just
a
kid
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
he
cam
over
to
yours
and
he
wanted
to
play
hide
and
seek
and
the
kid
just
hid
in
front
of
us
and
told
us
to
come
seek
him
💀
I
wanted
to
be
like
“
just
saw
you
go
in
the
closet
”
[sskarz]
Nah
gotta
pretend
you
’
re
blind
yk
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Was
just
a
kid
For
reals
Hey

got
class
at
11
right

[sskarz]
Okay

’
m

go
get
ready

the
morning

We
shall
see
,
I
’
ve
completed
all
of
the
in
class
assignments
so
I
might
just
go
for
attendance
and
leave
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Absolutely
,
you
go
get
ready
and
we
will
talk
when
you
are
ready
.
Nooo
but
don
’
t
do
that
because

and

[prabipyakurel]
Talk
to
you
tomorrow
!
[sskarz]
Hey
,
I
hope
you
read
this
in
the
morning
and
not
tonight
,
I
want
you
to
get
good
sleep
,
you
just
travelled
a
long
way
and
you
’
re
most
definitely
tired
,
so
if
you
see
this
before
you
sleep
,
put
the
phone
down
,
go
to
bed
,
and
then
read
the
next
in
the
morning
.
Please
.
I
haven
’
t
been
able
to
sleep
at
all
,
and
I
can
’
t
until
I
say
some
things
.
First
of
all
,
tonight
was
amazing
.
Seeing
you
again
really
made
me
have
butterflies
in
my
stomach
and
you
looked
stunning
as
always
.
So
thank
you
,
for
being
there
,
it
was
really
nice
seeing
you
again
.
Before
I
get
to
my
point
of
this
entire
message
,
please
understand
that
I
’
m
not
mad
at
all
,
and
I
wasn
’
t
at
all
at
any
point
during
tonight
.
I
had
lots
of
fun
!
It
’
s
just
that
I
feel
conflicted
,
in
a
way
that
you
probably
didn
’
t
know
.
Going
into
this
party
,
my
entire
reasoning
behind
being
excited
for
tonight
was
to
see
you
,
and
that
was
fulfilled
for
me
.
And
before
the
party
for
the
entire
week
,
we
’
ve
both
been
talking
about
how
excited
we
were
to
see
each
other
and
what
we
would
do
if
opportunities
had
ever
risen
for
the
both
of
us
to
be
isolated
from
the
rest
.
When
I
texted
you
to
come
outside
,
I
saw
that
as
our
one
opportunity
to
actually
be
able
to
talk
to
each
other
properly
.
And
looking
back
on
this
,
I
wish
I
hadn
’
t
.
I
’
m
really
,
deeply
,
sorry
if
it
made
you
super
uncomfortable
.
At
that
moment
,
I
could
tell
you
were
extremely
nervous
and
anxious
about
doing
that
thing
,
and
I
’
m
so
so
sorry
.
It
’
s
my
fault
and
I
should
’
ve
realized
this
sooner
instead
of
trying
to
remedy
it
.
Please
understand
that
if
I
had
known
before
hand
about
how
you
were
going
to
react
,
I
never
would
have
brought
you
out
.
For
that
,
I
am
so
sorry
.
My
only
expectation
when
it
came
to
seeing
you
outside
was
to
have
a
nice
hug
with
you
.
If
you
thought
I
had
other
intentions
,
please
understand
that
I
only
wanted
the
hug
that
I
promised
.
We
’
re
so
new
into
this
relationship
that
I
don
’
t
want
to
rush
things
that
don
’
t
need
rushing
.
I
love
you
for
you
,
for
who
you
are
as
a
person
,
and
nothing
will
change
that
.
I
remember
that
you
also
wanted
to
hug
,
and
so
that
’
s
the
only
thing
I
wanted
too
.
I
also
recognize
that
this
is
your
first
time
doing
anything
like
this
with
a
guy
and
I
get
it
.
But
,
your
reaction
threw
me
off
,
and
it
’
s
not
your
fault
,
but
it
kind
of
messed
with
me
tonight
.
A
part
of
me
is
regretful
for
doing
that
in
the
first
place
,
but
another
part
of
me
is
left
wondering
how
I
should
act
with
you
from
here
on
out
.
I
really
wasn
’
t
expecting
the
reaction
from
you
,
but
again
it
’
s
justified
for
the
way
that
I
also
acted
.
We
’
re
both
not
sure
of
the
next
time
we
’
ll
see
each
other
again
,
so
I
wanted
tonight
to
be
special
for
the
two
of
us
.
It
sounds
selfish
I
know
,
but
all
I
wanted
was
to
embrace
you
in
a
nice
hug
,
especially
since
I
’
ve
got
no
idea
if
the
next
time
I
’
ll
see
you
is
in
a
few
months
or
an
entire
year
,
which
is
why
I
feel
so
conflicted
in
the
first
place
.
It
’
s
not
your
fault
,
it
’
s
just
that
I
’
m
going
to
seriously
miss
you
.
Again
,
I
’
m
not
mad
at
all
,
trust
me
you
’
ve
gotta
do
something
terrible
to
make
me
mad
even
one
bit
.
But
I
,
my
heart
,
is
confused
of
what
to
think
about
tonight
,
as
great
as
it
was
.
And
I
just
needed
to
get
this
off
my
chest
so
I
can
sleep
.
I
still
love
you
,
as
much
as
I
did
before
this
entire
event
,
and
never
get
that
twisted
.
You
make
my
world
go
round
some
days
,
and
I
can
’
t
thank
you
enough
for
that
.
But
I
’
m
also
an
honest
person
,
that
wants
to
be
open
about
his
feelings
,
and
I
just
wanted
to
share
this
with
you
.
I
love
you
❤

Hey
,
I
know
you
told
me
to
read
this
in
the
morning
but
I
read
it
now
and
I
am
not
asleep
yet
either
,
sorry
if
I
am
disturbing
you
.
Seeing
you
today
was
magical
and
as
much
as
I
tried
to
keep
it
hidden
,
there
were
so
many
times
where
I
kept
glancing
at
you
.
When
you
made
me
feel
better
about
going
up
to
dance
while
I
was
nervous
and
supported
me
.
Trust
me
I
still
had
butterflies
and
could
not
believe
I
was
seeing
you
.
When
you
called
me
outside
,
I
was
ready
.
But
then
I
stepped
outside
and
saw
some
uncles
that
I
know
that
were
in
the
group
.
But
let
me
tell
you
,
when
you
brought
me
to
your
car
and
gave
me
the
first
glance
,
I
was
just
frozen
,
you
were
so
handsome
and
looked
really
nice
.
But
I
was
hesitating
because
the
uncles
was
walking
back
and
fourth
up
and
down
the
parking
lot
.
And
when
you
pulled
me
in
for
a
hug
,
you
don
’
t
even
know
how
much
I
wanted
to
just
stay
in
that
position
and
for
the
time
to
freeze
.
And
you
don
’
t
ever
need
to
act
differently
forward
me
,
just
talk
to
me
and
see
me
the
same
way
you
see
me
now
.
And
I
didn
’
t
get
inside
the
car
with
you
because
I
was
afraid
that
someone
(
possibly
your
family
)
would
come
to
get
you
or
ask
you
something
and
we
would
be
caught
getting
out
.
when
we
talked
that
time
,
I
was
so
happy
.
Yes
I
was
scared
as
hell
and
so
anxious
,
but
then
I
held
your
hands
and
it
felt
so
good
and
so
safe
.
Don
’
t
apologize
,
going
outside
was
not
a
mistake
and
I
should
be
the
one
apologizing
,
I
made
it
so
awkward
and
I
am
so
sorry
about
that
.
Just
know
that
after
that
interaction
,
I
felt
so
alive
and
so
excited
and
that
meet
with
you
made
my
night
.
I
am
sorry
if
anything
I
did
made
you
feel
that
way
.
I
am
so
in
love
with
you
and
will
forever
be
.
For
the
record
you
are
a
gentlemen
and
I
would
never
question
your
intentions
with
me
.
I
knew
I
was
going
for
a
hug
,
and
I
freaked
out
when
I
got
out
there
.
But
after
you
did
hug
me
and
talked
to
me
,
I
started
to
feel
better
.
I
wanted
to
talk
a
little
more
but
I
just
know
either
my
mom
if
not
my
brother
would
come
looking
for
me
and
everyone
would
have
been
looking
for
me
.
And
once
again
I
know
you
told
me
not
to
read
your
text
,
but
I
did
love
.
I
hope
that
this
doesn
’
t
change
anything
about
us
in
anyway
.
I
loved
seeing
you
dance
and
just
dancing
on
the
dance
floor
with
you
.
I
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
night
.
Love
you
so
much
!
Also
sorry
for
messaging
you
late
into
the
night
,
I
love
you
,
please
don
’
t
feel
like
I
am
drifting
away
from
you
.
You
have
all
of
my
heart
.

[sskarz]
Thank
you
for
being
honest
with
me
Prabi
,
it
really
made
me
feel
better
❤
️
I
hope
the
next
time
I
see
you
,
we
can
take
things
the
proper
way
and
not
have
to
do
that
again
[prabipyakurel]
No
next
time
I
will
try
to
you
know
not
freak
out
so
much
.
But
in
all
honestly
,
I
loved
that
you
pulled
me
closer
for
the
hug
.
❤
️
Good
morning
!
[sskarz]
Good
morning
!
It
’
s
not
your
fault
,
it
was
kinda
stupid
to
do
that
in
the
first
place
lol
.
Don
’
t
blame
yourself
[prabipyakurel]
No
hey
hey
,
but
I
hate
it
when
you
say
sorry
to
me
for
something
that
isn
’
t
your
fault
,
please
don
’
t
,
it
was
fun
sneaking
out
and
like
I
said
I
loved
it
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
’
m
taking
you
on
a
proper
date
next
time
😤
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
yes
you
are
,
and
you
will
too
.
But
I
am
extremely
sorry
for
making
you
feel
that
way
yesterday
,
I
was
truly
happy
,
I
was
scared
in
the
beginning
that
someone
was
going
to
catch
us
,
because
I
was
afraid
of
loosing
you
and
just
wanted
us
safe
,
however
when
you
held
my
hand
,
I
am
telling
you
it
was
so
amazing
and
I
felt
like
I
was
winning
in
life
when
I
said
bye
.
Also
I
would
have
started
crying
if
I
kept
staring
at
you
because
seeing
you
up
close
made
me
realize
how
hard
it
will
be
for
me
to
not
kiss
you
from
all
the
at
over
there
.
I
love
you
so
much
and
sooner
or
later
we
will
get
our
time
.
I
know
it
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
We
will
get
our
time
,
I
know
that
for
sure
.
Thank
you
for
making
my
night
great
nonetheless
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
don
’
t
even
know
,
I
loved
seeing
you
dance
and
just
vibing
with
you
“
music
Ma
”
😂
and
your
were
looking
so
handsome
and
cute
.
Thank
you
for
cheering
me
on
when
I
was
nervous
,
truly
,
I
would
have
finished
the
entire
jug
of
water
in
front
of
me
.
[sskarz]
You
honestly
danced
so
well
,
I
was
beyond
impressed
❤
️
Omg

don
’
t
even
know
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
so
much
,

a
lot
,
yea
I
tried
but
your
dance
was
so
niceeeee
,
if
your
dad
want
going
around
recording
us
,
I
would
have
just
sat
there
staring
at
you
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
When
you
were
dancing
up
there
,
my
nosy
cousin
,
sister
,
and
my
uncle
called
me
over
and
then
I
was
like
what
?
My
sister
looks
at
me
and
just
gives
me
the
biggest
wink
and
all
of
them
were
like
,
maybe
that
’
s
your
future
wife
.
I
was
like
EVERYONE
RELAXXXXXXX
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

that
thought
,
just
maybe
😉
❤
️
Your

all
entertain
the
idea
of
me
being
with
you
Even
at
the
dance
floor
idk
if
you
noticed
,
but
my
nosy
cousin
’
s
wife
pulled
me
into
a
circle
and
you
got
pulled
in
with
me
to
try
and
make

I
’
m
prepared
for
how
much
I
’
m
going
to
miss
you
for
these
next
few
months
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
want
to
think
about
it
I
wish
time
froze
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
think
about
that
too
sometimes
❤
️
Oh
yeah
,
my
morning
started
off
on
a
very
interesting
note
I
woke
up
,
texted
you
,
went
downstairs
and
my
mom
and
sister
were
talking
and
then
I
noticed
,
and
then
we
started
talking
about
last
night
.
The
first
topic
was
:
oh
you
remembered
Prabi
right
?
Are
you
interested
in
her
?
And
I
was
like
uhhhhhhh
everyone
let
’
s
all
relax
for
a
bit
here
I
just
woke
up
😭
I
said
yeah
a
part
of
me
is
interested
and
then
my
mom
was
like
,
well
why
don
’
t
you
guys
talk
more
,
get
her
number
or
something
and
I
was
like
YO
CHILLLLLLL
Basically
I
had
to
deflect
the
conversation
by
saying
there
’
s
no
way
I
’
d
be
able
to
talk
to
her
consistently
when
she
’
s
studying
like
crazy
and
I
can
’
t
be
a
nuisance
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
so
sweet
,
i
love
how
i
am
a
topic
in
your
family
so
much
.
There
were
so
many
other
people
,
they
didnt
ask
if
you
were
interested
in
them
lol
.
Little
do
they
know
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Nope
it
was
straight
to
you
My
sister
was
like
,
did
you
like
anyone
else
there
?
And
I
was
like
nah
I
’
m
good
[prabipyakurel]
You
dont
tell
them
we
talk
right
,
if
they
ask
,
we
have
insta
,
and
that
is
all
okay
.
Yea
as
you
should
be
,
you
are
mine
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
No
my
sister
knows
we
follow
each
other
but
no
one
knows
that
we
talk
Love
ittttt
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
okay
,
and
you
are
now
sarah
hernandez
,
my
friend
at
berkeley
.
[sskarz]
And
you
are
Peter
,
possibly
Parker
maybe
Spider
-
Man
who
knows
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
a
message
yesterday
and
I
was
like
sarah
who
for
a
sec
.
I
let
out
a
laugh
but
good
thing
there
wasnt
anyone
around
[sskarz]
Haha
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Lets
keep
me
as
peter
.
[sskarz]
Yep
that
’
s
what
I
have
you
as
Now
if
someone
were
to
look
through
those
messages
,
I
’
m
scared
they
’
re
gonna
think
I
’
m
gay
💀
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
tho
[sskarz]
But
no
one
goes
through
my
phone
so
it
should
be
all
good
lmao
👍
oh
no
I
can
’
t
that
sounds
like
a
nightmare
[prabipyakurel]
They
will
be
like
,
sanskar
we
need
to
talk
.
😭
I
can
just
imagine
your
parents
going
,
"
explain
yourself
"
[sskarz]
At
that
point
,
I
’
m
ratting
us
out
😂
😂
I
canttttttt
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhhhh
im
just
thinking
about
it
now
your
family
is
like
,
omg
he
is
gay
.
[sskarz]
No
no
no
no
no
no

this
very
beautiful
and
smart
woman
and
you
’
d
all
love
her
trust
me
that
’
s
how
it
’
s
going
down
to
save
myself
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
you
have
to
say
it
is
a
girl
,
but
dont
give
away
the
name
and
dont
give
stupid
hints
to
anyone
either
you
will
for
sure
give
me
up
[sskarz]
I
won
’
t
I
don
’
t
play
games
based
on
other
people
’
s
promises
and
needs
If
you
want
anonymity
,
then
it
’
ll
stay
like
that
You
can
trust
me
on
that
[prabipyakurel]
God
dammit
,
i
love
you
so
much
❤
️
I
wish
I
could
repeat
last
night
after
the
dance
part
of
course
,
like
near
dinner
[sskarz]
Oh
,
you
mean
when
we
went
outside
?
Or
after
the
party
[prabipyakurel]
yea
when
we
went
outside
[sskarz]
what
would
you
have
done
differently
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
would
have
taken
a
deep
breath
and
focused
on
you
rather
than
think
about
getting
caught
And
held
your
hand
longer
,
hugged
you
longer
,
just
stay
there
smiling
at
you
longer
[sskarz]
That
would
’
ve
been
nice
for
sure
,
but
honestly
what
’
s
in
the
past
is
in
the
past
❤
️
I
learned
my
own
lessons
and
I
’
d
rather
live
off
that
experience
then
to
never
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
Yea
I
am
only
going
to
remember
when
you
told
me
how
beautiful
I
looked
and
when
you
hugged
me
.
No
yea
I
realized
that
I
was
not
the
best
when
I
went
outside
,
but
it
was
because
I
was
just
nervous
,
and
I
love
you
so
much
.
[sskarz]
I
also
just
put
you
on
the
spot
without
consulting
with
you
first
,
I
could
’
ve
gone
about
that
better
It
’
s
not
your
fault
Regardless
,
I
got
to
see
your
smile
with
my
own
eyes
,
and
that
’
s
all
I
needed
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
we
are
going
to
do
it
better
next
time
.
Its
not
yours
either
,
sanskar
dont
ever
apologize
to
me
ever
.
Ahhh
you
were
so
handsome
,
and
lovely
,
and
looked
amazing
.
[sskarz]
You
were
everything
I
hoped
for
and
more
,
so
thank
you
for
being
my
everything
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhh
gosh
,
you
know
when
you
winked
at
me
at
the
dinner
table
when
I
was
nervous
,
a
part
of
me
just
wanted
to
scream
love
you
there
.
That
was
so
adorable
.
You
too
,
you
are
my
entire
world
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
haha
,
I
wasn
’
t
planning
on
doing
that
but
it
just
so
reminded
me
[prabipyakurel]
The
best
way
to
boost
my
confidence
.
I
would
have
looked
at
you
while
dancing
,
but
I
was
dancing
without
glasses
and
ngl
i
could
not
even
see
the
people
in
the
front
row
clearly
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
get
you
I
was
once
also
like
that
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

with
glasses
how
i
first

you
[sskarz]
I
low
key
miss
how
I
looked
with
glasses
on
Idk
it
just
feels
like
something
is
off
[prabipyakurel]
You

so
cute
both
with

😂
[sskarz]
Haha

[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[sskarz]
I
’
m
just
laying
down
thinking
about
you
[prabipyakurel]
🥰
[sskarz]
Makes
me
feel
calm
when
I
think
about
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Its
all
i
think
about
when
I
am
stressed
I
think
about
everything
you
have
said
to
me
.
I
reread
our
conversation
when
I
miss
you
.
It
hits
different
.
[sskarz]
It
does
.
Oh
which
that
reminds
me
I
was
rereading
through
our
late
night
and
morning
conversation
,
and
idk
how
but
I
didn
’
t
notice
that
you
almost
wanted
to
kiss
me
[prabipyakurel]
wait
what
[sskarz]
I
had
to
rub
my
eyes
for
that
Yeah
^
Did
you
mistype
or
…
[prabipyakurel]
🤭
I
meant
miss
but
that
can
be
a
future
thing
[sskarz]
Right
,
that
makes
more
sense
[prabipyakurel]
im
sorry
[sskarz]
We
will
see
about
that
No
reason
to
be
sorry
love
,
just
noticed
something
that
’
s
all
We
both
are
terrible
typers
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
SO
bad
geez
,
I
just
noticed
it
,
but
i
meant
to
say
I
would
have
started
crying
the
more
i
kept
staring
into
your
eyes
.
We
shall
.
[sskarz]
Good
thing
you
pulled
away
then
lol
I
would
’
ve
felt
worse
if
you
started
to
cry
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
it
would
have
been
happy
tears
I
kinda
wish
I
didnt
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
life
,
we
all
go
through
things
we
didn
’
t
think
we
would
and
wish
for
better
outcomes
or
something
like
that
I
’
m
okay
with
how
everything
went
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
was
really
happy
,
it
was
a
good
feeling
.
I
just
want
to
hold
your
hands
again
,
honestly
i
was
so
excited
about
seeing
you
and
being
around
you
,
i
didnt
really
think
about
how
it
would
feel
like
shit
leaving
you
and
going
away
again
.
[sskarz]
Hey
it
’
s
okay
,
it
only
feels
like
this
right
now
.
We
will
both
be
fine
Just
imagine
I
’
m
holding
your
hands
right
now
,
through
the
screen
,
every
time
we
talk
❤
️
If
that
gives
you
more
peace
of
mind
[prabipyakurel]
It
does
,
i
just
imagine
you
simling
I
am
still
waiting
for
pictures
from
people
with
just
you
in
it
I
will
crop
you
out
and
keep
it
❤
️
My
aunt
has
one
,
but
she
still
needs
to
send
it
to
me
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
deserve
you
,
I
love
you
so
much
[prabipyakurel]
You
do
,
we
both
do
.
Even
out
families
think
so
that
is
saying
a
lot
Don
'
t
say
such
thing
,
you
deserve
only
the
best
.
[sskarz]
I
’
m
glad
I
have
the
best
with
me
right
now
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
think
I
’
ve
ever
had
such
heart
ache
for
anyone
in
my
life
than
you
It
hasn
’
t
even
been
a
day
and
I
can
’
t
stop
thinking
about
you
[prabipyakurel]
Ugh
the
hug
from
you
yesterday
,
I
am
replaying
it
when
you
pulled
me
in
for
a
hug
I
loved
it
Nah
uh
,
never
[sskarz]
I
just
wish
I
could
be
beside
you
all
the
time
[prabipyakurel]
I
felt
so
safe
in
your
arms
,
it
was
the
best
.
You
are
,
you
are
with
me
in
my
heart

[sskarz]
I
see
why
people
say
long
distance
is
hard
now
,
I
get
it
I
’
m
not
giving
up
ever
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
,
I
would
always
be
like
,
I
am
always
in
a
long
distance
because
I
was
single
,
but
i
guess
i
know
how
it
feels
now
.
I
will
do
whatever
it
takes
,
the
distance
is
only
little
right
now
,
sooner
or
later
we
will
get
past
that
stage
.
[sskarz]
Yeah

re
right
,
even
if
it
takes
years
,
I
swear
to
you
I

No

[prabipyakurel]
I

be
here
in
december
.
I
have
to
,
no
you
are
not
going
to
come
get
me
like
that
.
[sskarz]
I
wouldn
’
t
bring
you
back
with
me
,
I
’
d
just
visit
[prabipyakurel]
Its
not
like
"
mom
imma
go
get
milk
from
this
one
store
in
the
bay
area
"
But
still
,
what
would
you
say
?
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
tell
the
most
scandalous
lies
if
that
’
s
what
it
takes
I
’
d
figure
something
out
[prabipyakurel]
Well
If
I
dont
come
in
december
,
which
is
unlikely
,
I
will
let
you
know
.
We
will
video
call
but
you
are
not
going
to
waste
7
hours
driving
to
see
me
.
[sskarz]
I
just
might
,
and
what
would
you
do
if
I
did
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hug
you
because
I
dont
care
if
anyone
there
sees
me
Hold
hands
Talk
a
lot
Take
you
to
eat
somewhere
[sskarz]
Hey
can
you
promise
me
something
?
I
know
this
sounds
kind
of
selfish
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[sskarz]
Can
we
have
a
proper
date
when
that
time
comes
?
No
sneaking
around
at
functions
and
being
afraid
we
might
get
caught
.
I
just
want
you
for
a
day
,
just
to
myself
[prabipyakurel]
I
promise
,
when
that
time
comes
,
we
will
go
on
a
proper
day
where
you
can
have
me
just
for
yourself
.
I
also
want
that
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Okay
I
’
m
glad
[prabipyakurel]
But
Sanskar
I
dont
know
when
that
time
will
be
.
[sskarz]
I
know
.
And
you
don
’
t
need
to
know
now
❤
️
I
just
wanted
to
hear
you
also
wanting
the
same
thing
[prabipyakurel]
What
what
do
you
mean
it
sounds
selfish
,
its
not
selfish
at
all
,
you
are
such
a
gentleman
and
so
lovable
.
[sskarz]
It
’
s
my
selfish
desire
Something
that
I
keep
to
myself
as
a
reminder
for
why
I
work
so
hard
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
your
desire
,
its
not
selfish
at
all
.
And
sometimes
I
think
about
how
you
love
me
so
much
and
like
go
to
school
early
and
all
just
so
you
can
call
me
and
we
met
yesterday
and
I
literally
left
you
,
I
feel
like
I
am
not
able
to
give
you
the
same
back
.
[sskarz]
That
’
s
not
the
same
thing
at
all
,
I
know
you
tried
your
best
for
what
you
felt
at
that
moment
.
And
it
’
s
okay
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
yea
,
but
let
me
know
if
you
ever
feel
mad
at
me
or
sad
.
[sskarz]
Of
course
I
will
love
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
!
[sskarz]
I
love
you
even
more
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
can
I
ask
something
,
a
little
dumb
.
[sskarz]
Go
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
Um
so
you
know
how
like
a
while
back
when
we
were
talking
about
like
people
on
the
road
that
run
into
the
car
for
money
,
Yea
and
you
metioned
that
your
tesla
has
a
camera
everywhere
,
when
we
met
near
your
car
,
that
wasnt
recorded
or
anything
right
.
Sorry
i
was
just
thinking
about
it
.
[sskarz]
I
made
sure
before
hand
that
the
feature
was
turned
off
I
thought
about
everything
yk
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
you
really
did
.
Thank
you
[sskarz]
There
is
no
video
for
what
happened
,
don
’
t
worry
❤
️
No
one
even
suspected
I
was
out
anyways
[prabipyakurel]
Mmmm
yea
the
moment
I
walked
in
my
brother
made
eye
contact
with
me
,
I
ran
into
him
at
the
door
because
he
was
looking
for
me
to
use
my
phone
to
take
a
picture
of
something
.
Thats
good
.
[sskarz]
Then
what
we
did
was
in
perfect
timing
Had
it
gone
any
longer
,
maybe
it
would
’
ve
been
way
worse
[prabipyakurel]
I
guess
so
,
but
I
loved
it
.
Your
hugs
are
amazing
.
Even
though
we
werent
even
properly
standing
,
that
meeting
was
perfect
.
[sskarz]
I
’
m
glad
you
liked
it
❤
️
just
know
that
I
’
m
not
trying
something
like
that
ever
again
For
my
sake
[prabipyakurel]
When
we
see
each
other
again
,
we
will
sneak
out
again
if
we
have
to
.
[sskarz]
Honey
,
I
don
’
t
want
to
…
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
it
might
be
the
only
alone
time
i
might
get
with
you
[sskarz]
If
I
’
m
going
to
spend
time
with
you
,
it
needs
to
be
without
the
burden
of
us
getting
into
trouble
I
’
m
sorry
,
but
this
is
the
only
way
I
can
’
t
risk
something
like
that
again
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
see
,
I
get
that
,
yea
it
is
more
comfortable
when
we
dont
have
to
look
over
our
shoulders
.
We
wont
,
unless
we
both
know
that
we
are
safe
and
all
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Thank
you
for
understanding
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
completely
understand
,
but
yesterday
,
I
am
glad
I
did
that
.
I
got
to
hold
your
hands
for
a
bit
and
i
needed
that
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
won
’
t
be
the
last
time
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
It
wont
.
Also
it
was
so
cute
of
you
to
post
my
brothers
dance
.
Thanks
!
[sskarz]
He
killed
that
dance
,
had
to
show
that
off
I
would
’
ve
taken
your
video
if
it
wasn
’
t
for
my
entire
family
looking
at
my
reaction
to
seeing
you
dance
[prabipyakurel]
He
really
did
,
I
love
it
,
dude
was
so
energetic
,
kinda
felt
bad
for
calling
him
idiot
at
the
dinner
table
lol
No
yea
dont
,
i
cant
image
what
they
would
think
if
you
were
.
[sskarz]
Haha
my
sister
noticed
and
told
me
today
in
the
morning
[prabipyakurel]
that
I
called
him
an
idiot
?
[sskarz]
No
not
that
specifically
,
I
think
he
was
asking
for
your
phone
and
you
said
something
back
and
my
sister
was
like
oh
shit
,
she
sounding
like
me
to
sanskar
😂
[prabipyakurel]
OH
yea
,
no
he
left
his
glasses
somewhere
and
I
told
him
that
is
a
you
problem
.
[sskarz]
Yep
that
’
s
what
it
was
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
siblings
be
like
that
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
all
the
time
😂
[prabipyakurel]
sometimes
words
just
slip
out
of
my
mouth
and
I
sound
like
the
meanest
person
alive
or
like
I
would
give
something
a
nasty
look
and
realize
how
mean
i
looked
[sskarz]
Glad
I
haven
’
t
seen
that
side
yet
[prabipyakurel]
You
wont
[sskarz]
I
would
be
terrified
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Its
usually
a
brother
type
of
thing
only
[sskarz]
so
not
a
boyfriend
type
of
thing
,
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
or
like
when
your
sister
was
showing
me
thing
picture
of
a
dude
and
i
made
that
"
nah
he
ugly
"
face
Nope
,
I
wont
ever
have
you
show
you
that
side
.
[sskarz]
hahaha
she
was
trying
to
get
you
on
someone
?
That
’
s
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
just
be
the
cute
short
one
for
you
[sskarz]
hey
if
I
ever
screw
up
,
you
will
be
mean
to
me
[prabipyakurel]
No

was
showing
me
this
dude
that
kreepa
followed
because
he
like
swezna
diju
and
i
was
like
nope

is
ugly
😂
[sskarz]

rose
tinted
glasses
for
how
I
act
and
if
I
fall
out
of
line
or
place
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
You
wont
,
you
are
perfect
for
me
.
❤
️
I
will

you
know
if
you
are
being
a
little
more
idiotic

that
!
[prabipyakurel]
Love
you
idiot
❤
️
[sskarz]
Idk
if
I
told
you
this
,
but
I
hate
yes
men
I
like
to
surround
myself
with
people
that
can
point
out
my
flaws
and
I
can
do
the
same
for
them
Not
those
that
will
agree
to
everything
I
have
to
say
sometimes
I
say
or
do
dumbass
shit
and
I
’
d
like
to
be
called
out
for
it
appropriately
[prabipyakurel]
No
certianly
,
I
need
someone
to
tell
me
the
truth
and
not
"
oh

look
beautiful
,
when
I

like
the
weirdest
person
.
I
will
Like

[prabipyakurel]
You

the
stage
where
I
will

at
you

joke
around
with

[sskarz]
I
’
m
very
deeply
in

with
you

starting
to

me
on
the
daily
,
when
I
think
of
you
my
heart
beat
gets
faster
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
and
It
makes
my
heart
beat
faster
everytime
I
think
about
you
.
❤
️
I
be
running
around
the
house
with
music
in
my
ears
thinking
of
you
,
my
household
members
think
its
because
I
have
been
away
for
so
long
.
😂
[sskarz]
Awwwww
and
they
have
no
clue
why
[prabipyakurel]
Also
DO
NOT
SEND
ME
A
MESSAGE
ON
INSTA
UNTIL
TUESDAY
BECAUSE
MY
BROTHER
IS
WATCHING
INSTA
REELS
ON
MY
PHONE
RN
.
[sskarz]
Gotcha
👍
[prabipyakurel]
No

smile
and
hug
my
mom
from
the
happiness
I
get
from
you

this
point
I
don
’
t
care
,
I
want
to
hug
you
so
tight
god
damn
it
I
wish
time
could
just
skip
and
let
me
get
to
the
part
where
I
can
spend
my
time
with
you
any
day
[prabipyakurel]
No
for
real
,
like
when
I
could
just
say
"
im
heading
out
for
a
little
bit
"
and
I
could
just
lay
down
next
to
you
at
some
park
and
we
can
just
stare
at
the
stars
.
[sskarz]
Sounds
like
an
amazing
date
idea
,
I
’
ll
add
that
to
the
picnic
idea
[prabipyakurel]
Add
it
,
just
a
park
without
dogs
yk
those
dog
owners
be
everywhere
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
When
I
delete
a
convo
,
does
it
delete
from
your
side
too
?
[sskarz]
Let
me
check
,
but
I
believe
no
I
still

our
texts
[prabipyakurel]
Check
,
but
dont
write
anything
Okay
,

it
no

is
scrolling
though
your
insta
[sskarz]
Nope
👍
my
phone
stays
in
my
pocket
or
on
me
at
all
times
Not
even
my
nosy
cousin
could
get
it
from
me
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwwwww
he
is
like
going
for
you
[sskarz]
He
really
wants
us
to
be
a
thing
,
even
his
wife
is
a
fan
of
it
lol
[prabipyakurel]
his
wife
is
the
sweetest
person
,
idk
if
i
have
mentioned
it
,
she
is
so
beautiful
and
lovely
.
No
she
is
,
i
have
a
feeling
.
[sskarz]
she
is
very
nice
My
family
would
probably
celebrate
if
they
found
out
about
us
[prabipyakurel]
And
yesterday
she
came
up
to
me
and
complimented
me
about
my
dance
and
dress
and
I
was
like
omg
thank
you
[sskarz]
Awwww
that
’
s
nice
of
her
👍
[prabipyakurel]
hopefully
,
I
am
looking
forward
to
that
day
when
i
comes
tho
.
Not
when
we
get
caught
,
but
when
we
can
plan
how
to
break
the
news
you
know
[sskarz]
Yeah
of
course
And
we
’
re
not
getting
caught
Remember
,
no
more
risky
things
[prabipyakurel]
We
are
not
Nope
And
we
played
it
safe
yesterday
inside
,
no
one
suspected
anyting
'
other
than
your
sister
and
cousin
ofc
[sskarz]
well
they
just
knew
you
were
there
so
they
immediately
turned
to
me
and
said
,
hey
look
isn
’
t
she
just
perfect
for
you
and
I
had
to
pretend
nah
In
my
head
tho

s
my
world
right
there
My
mom
earlier

sanskar
if
you
don
’
t
get
with
her
,
you
’
re
not
going
to
find
someone
better
later
and
I
was
like
can
everyone
just
chill
the
hell
out
😂
(
thankfully
I
already
am
with
her
so
it
’
s
no
problem
)
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
just
talking
it
all

[sskarz]
No
worries
[prabipyakurel]
Your
mom
has
got
nothing
to
worry
about
,
your
family
is
like
the
sweetest
.
No

you
are
perfect
.

into
a
car
crash

math
hw
.
Also
have
a
quiz
every
thursday

resting
for
a
little
before
I
start
everything
,
or
maybe
I
will
just
start
.
[sskarz]
take
as
much

say
someone

that
to
you
or
its
for
your
mom
no
other
explanation
[sskarz]
Ok
this
actually
reminded
me
of
a
funny
story
So
one
time
,
I
brought
over
my
group
of
friends
to
my
house
to
hang
out
and
eat
food
and
whatever
,
and
one
of
my
friends
came
through
MY
FRONT
DOOR
WITH
A
CAMERA
,
wearing
a
suit
,
tophat
,
and
brought
roses
for
me
😂
I
was
DONE
and
my
parents
saw
the
camera
feed
and
questioned
me
so
hard
😭
That
prank
was
death
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
if
they
read
our
messages
they
will
think
that
you
are
actually
gay
and
tie
it
together
to
this
one
story
.
😂
What
was
your
explanation
?
[sskarz]
That
my
friend
pranked
me
,
and
they
didn
’
t
want
to
believe
that
😭
So
I
just
laughed
it
off
and
they
eventually
forgot
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
They
must
have
all
questioned
you
for
a
while
[sskarz]
It
was
like
an
hour
of
straight
grilling
me
😂
I
got
so
mad
at
my
friend
but
it
was
pretty
funny
after
looking
back
at
it
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
but
that
is
cute
tho
,
your
friend
just
wanted
to
show
his
love
for
you
,
just
in
a
different
way
you
know
a
gay
way
'
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
he
acts
so
gay
with
our
group
but
he
gets
girls
like
crazy
Idk
it
’
s
that
gay
rizz
I
guess
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
he
acts
gay
but
gets
girls
something
is
not
adding
up
[sskarz]
Yup
idk
what
to
tell
u
😂
[prabipyakurel]

sorry
for
those
girls
💀
you
are
not
gonna
go
tell
your
friend
that
I
am
talking
trash
about
him
[sskarz]
Like

’
s
not
gay
,
but

ll

gay
around
us

[sskarz]
Of

my
roadmap

my
life
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

times
[sskarz]

No

when
we
started
texting
a
while
back
,
my
brother
was
like
why
does
this
dada
use
such
formal
language
when
talking
to
me
,
and
I
was
gonna
say
,
he
does
the
same
for
me
,
but
I
was
like
,
idk
.
I
didnt
want
him
to
know
that
we
talked
because
then
the
next
time
we
were
brought
up
(
which
we
were
brought
up
frequently
whenever
they
saw
you
anywhere
),
he
would
have
been
like
,
ooooooooo
yea
they
talk
all
the
time
,
and
then
my
family
would
be
like
,
why
?
what
do
you
talk
about
?
[sskarz]
Omg
that
’
s
hilarious
😂
What
did
you
say
to
that

[prabipyakurel]
When
we
were
brought
up
?
I
would
always
walk
away
and
smile
after
i
turned
the
corner
.
[sskarz]
Whenever
your
family
would
say
why
LOL
the
most
suspicious
thing
to
do
ever
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

parents
dont
know
we
talk
surprisingly
my
brother
hasnt
told
them
[sskarz]
Ah

brother
knows
we

one
time
in
fourth
of

graduation
party
and
i

?
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
nice
,
dinner
was
meh
for
me
,
nothing
too
appetizing
aside
from
the
cake
i
guess
I
had
pizza
,
they
only
had
beef
,
and
then
i
got
some
egg
pasta
that
was
kinda
gross
tbh
missing
home
made
food
[sskarz]
ooooo
cake
yeah
it
really
be
like
that
maybe
you
should
have
some
momos
from
that
one
nepali
place
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
german
chocolate
cake
,
but
it
was
alright
[sskarz]
to
alleviate
some
of
that
homesick
food
[prabipyakurel]
I
cant
have
too
much
of
that
either
,
I
am
thinking
of
going
to
get
the
chowmein
from
that
place
sometimes
this
week
though
No
its
a
mix
of
missing
everyone
and
the
food
feels
a
little
out
of
place
,
but
it
will
be
better
tomorrow
[sskarz]
yeah
,
it
sucks
but
you
gotta
do
what
you
gotta
do
yk
?
it
'
ll
get
better

gotta
get
back
in
the
groove
of
things

Your

[sskarz]
when

i
had
braces
for
like
5
years
straight
and
i
really
didn
'
t
like
my
smile
with
braces
on
so
i
got
used
to
smiling
with
just
my
lips
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
is
so
adorable
too
[sskarz]
if
you

you
for
the
first
time
,
you
introduced
yourself
and
let
out
a
small
laugh
and
it
was
just
so
precious
.
[sskarz]
omg
you
remember
that
?
that
'
s
so
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
it
like
a
movie
It
was
one
of
those
amazing
nights
honestly
,
baba
said
you
guys
had
a
dog
and
I
was
like
"
maybe
I
wont
go
",
i
didn
'
t
care
about
bear
'
s
existence
when
I
saw
you
.
I
am
like
oh
well
,
dog
is
there
,
but
who
cares
.
There
is
a
cute
guy
there
too
😂
❤
️
[sskarz]
i
was
so
surprised
to
see
someone
so
beautiful
there
i
just
had
to
try
my
luck
yk
😂
❤
️
so
so
so
glad
it
worked
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
,
I
saw
you
and
you
were
a
senior
and
I
was
like
a
sophomore
and
I
was
like
,
there
is
no
way
.
I
thought
you
still
saw
me
as
a
child
.
[sskarz]
well
...
i
liked
you
but
yk
you
were
still
pretty
young
❤
️
and
then
you
matured
out
to
be
even
better
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
have
grown
a
lot
from
my
high
school
self
.
[sskarz]
you
just
get
prettier
by
the
day
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
in
a
lot
of
aspects
,
but
mainly
just
perspective
wise
and
positive
mentality
and
other
stuff
.
Especially
when
our
conversations
started
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
SO

new
goal

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

,
I
might
seem
the
same
to
a
lot
of
people
,
but
I
myself
think
that
I
have
grown
.
Well
I
have
not
gone
through
bad
times
,
just
grown
more
and
worked
on
how
to
avoid
taking
on
too
many
things
at
once
.
❤
️

fr
me
on
my
phone
[prabipyakurel]
aww
you

on
the
floor
like
that
too
[sskarz]
sometimes
i
just
lay
on
the
ground
,
lowkey
meditative
💯
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
feels
good
laying
on
the
ground
I
do
that
too
and
then
my
brother
steps
on
my
legs
and
I
am
like
nah
😂
[sskarz]
you
guys
have
such
a
funny
relationship
i
swear
😂
seeing
you
guys
at
the
party
interact
,
i
wanted
to
laugh
so
bad
when
you
gave
him
the
look
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
kept
on
stepping
on
my
dress
with
his
size
10
or
13
shoes
and
I
was
just
ready
to
slap
the
kid
out
of
existence
💀
And
then
you
were
there
just
staring
at
us
and
I
was
like
"
lets
not
do
that
"
Yea
that
stare
,
i
do
that
often
,
and
it
usually
lasts
a
good
30
seconds
before
i
look
away
.
[sskarz]
imma
stare
at
you
back
if
you
give
me
that
look
😂
[prabipyakurel]
i
dare
you
[sskarz]
oh
i
will
love
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
probably
just
start
laughing
[sskarz]
don
'
t
tempt
me
with
a
good
time
😂
[prabipyakurel]
we
got
to
have
a
staring
contest
either
over
the
video
call
or
something
I
dont
know
,
I
cant
imagine
you
with
a
serious
stare
😂
i
saw
that
[sskarz]
oh
i
can
give
you
one
alright
live
laugh
love
or
something
like
that
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Really

i
have
not
seen
you
with
any
other
expressions
then
the
cute
smiling
ones
[sskarz]
you
'
ll
see
it
if
you
do
anything
dumb
enough
to
make
me
mad
lol
but
otherwise
,
i

smiling
at
you
no
reason
not
to
smile
:)
[prabipyakurel]

smiling
at
you
.
[sskarz]
i
doubt
you
will
tho
,
you
'
re

nice
and
i
don
'
t
think
i
can
see
myself
getting
mad
at
you
without
laughing
right
after
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
have
seen
me
with
the
stare
,
laugh
,
smile
.
I
will
keep
ticking
you
until
you
laugh
if
you
are
ever
mad
You
have
also
seen
me
be
the
most
nervous
person
ever
I
was
chewing
on
my
fingers
when
it
was
almost
my
time
to
perform
.
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
i
saw
,
and
i
wanted
to
put
my
hand
on
your
shoulder
and
tell
you
its
alright
but
i
thought
it
'
d
be
going
too
far
publicly
😭
❤
️
so
i
tapped
you
oh
yeah
i
saw
that
first
hand
😂
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No

I
was
staring
at
the
door
and
then
you
tapped
me
and
I
was
like
"
uh
what
"
It
was
really
sweet
tho
,
that
helped
a
lot
you
know
,
the
slight
wink
and
all
.
❤
️
You
cousin
would
have
been
investigating
you
all
the
way
if
you
did
that
[sskarz]
omg
i
actually
got
worried
someone
across
from
me
saw
the
wink
i
gave
you
😂
he
was
deadass
watching
me
be
close
to
you
the
whole
time
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
was
for
my
eyes
to
see
only
,
no
one
saw
.
lol
,
we
werent
even
sitting
too
close
he
was
so
far
away
too
[sskarz]
no
like
you
know
how
we
went
and
walked
to
the
center
of
the
place
to
watch
the
dances
?
i
saw
him
looking
at
me
and
then
he
looked
at
you
and
smiled
and
i
was
like

😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh

time
you
were
literally
behind
me
[sskarz]

you

how

I

😂
[sskarz]

my
shoulders

[sskarz]
i

just
watching
a
youtube
documentary
thing
some
white
noise
oh
and
your
brother
started
texting
me
haha
[prabipyakurel]
This
late
,
idiot

got
school
tomorrow
[sskarz]

but
you

he
Both
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
But
you

tired
and

your
health

.
[sskarz]
speaking
of
water
check
!

water
right
now
[prabipyakurel]

idea
I
have
not
drank
water
since
like
2
hours
back
or
after
dinner
Okie
ty
,
i
drank
water
[sskarz]
omg
you
should
[prabipyakurel]
you
do
the
same
[sskarz]
same
here
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
that
one
time
you
video
called
and
I
was
just
watching
you
drink
water
😂
[sskarz]
just
drank
like
close
to
half
of
my
gallon
of
water
bottle
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
hilarious
,
but
i
didnt
want
you
to
choke
so
i
didnt
laugh
I
am
not
that
far
down
[sskarz]
awwwwww
you
'
re
so
considerate
[prabipyakurel]
When
I
drink
water
,
I
drink
like
a
sip
and
stop
i
think
that
is
the
problem
[sskarz]
yep
,

more
sips
deeper
sips
[prabipyakurel]
No

hate
the
idea
of
people
choking
even
if
its
water
.
For
sure
,
I
will
love
.
❤
️

Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
yea
,
I
am
still
feeling
a
little
tired
,
but
it
’
s
probably
because
this
weekend
was
really
busy
,
but
I
slept
well
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Eh
about
the
same
,
I
had
to
sleep
later
around
like
12
because
I
just
couldn
’
t
fall
asleep
,
but
I
feel
good
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
nice
,
yes
and
Sanskar

,

Have
you

gotten
up
with
those
lines
on
your
hands
like
after
you
get
up
from
sleeping
?
[sskarz]
Yeah
lol
it
’
s
happened
Not
that
often
but
yes
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
have
so
many
on
my
arms
and
lol
I
think
it
’
s
because
I
fell
asleep
on
one
of
my
arms
today
😂
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
haha
yeah
that
would
make
sense
What
kind
of
position
do
you
sleep
in
[prabipyakurel]
In
the
fetal
position
but
sometimes
like
when
I
am
sick
or
I
have
a
stuffy
nose
I
will
sleep
facing
up
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Literally
the
same
lol
[prabipyakurel]
I
either
turn
away
or
at
the
wall
Samesies
Again
lol
[sskarz]
Oh
hold
on
,
mom
just
called
and
apparently
she
made
me
breakfast
,
unexpected
[prabipyakurel]

Sometimes

not
going
to
risk
it
,
I
got
a
list
in
my
head
.
❤
️
But
I
am
hanging
up
that
riddle
you
made
for
me
tho
I
will
print
it
out
[sskarz]
Awwww
yeah
leave
the
list
to
me
,
no
one
’
s
gonna
find
out
about
that
Oh
god
no
💀
[prabipyakurel]

that
for
us
.
Yea
When
i
do
my
end
of
2023
insta
post
,
that
will
be
on
there
.
[sskarz]
My
friends
when
they
find
out
about
that
,
I
’
m
gonna
be
roasted
alive
that
day
[prabipyakurel]
if
i
do
that
They
wont
know
its
you
,
they
will
love
it
,
it
was
so
nice
[sskarz]
Oooo
wouldn
’
t
that
be
a
little
revealing
for
anyone
paying
close
attention
?
They
would
instantly
know
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Who
would
pay
close
attention
?
Damn
,
you
play
riddles
with
them
too
.
[sskarz]
I
mean
true
,
but
no
one
probably
will
[prabipyakurel]
No
one
will
[sskarz]
No
no
,
they
just
know
bad
writing
and
me
are
quite
affiliated
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
but
seriously
that
was
so
cute
i
mean
it
wasnt
the
hardest
riddle
it
toook
me
5
minutes
[sskarz]
Well
you
didn
’
t
solve
it
in
the
way
I
intended
😭
[prabipyakurel]
but
it
was
the
best
trying
to
figure
that
out
and
how
to
tell
you
ofc
But
I
solved
it
you
made
it
so
clear
with
the
last
sentence
And
I
mentioned
that
to
you
thee
means
you
"
the
letter
that
spelled
you
"
[sskarz]
I
just
wanted
it
to
rhyme
😭
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
in
front
of
my
face
[sskarz]
I
had
no
idea
it
meant
you
💀
[prabipyakurel]
well
it
served
both
purposes
[sskarz]
I
’
m
such
a
dumbass
hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
no
i
am
the
idiotic
one
just
imagine
[sskarz]
far
from
it
love
smartest
girl
I
know
I
’
ll
swear
by
it
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
not
me
and
it
was
another
girl
and
you
added
that
to
make
it
rhyme
,
and
i
said
it
was
me
I
would
have
started
looking
for
a
coffin
for
myself
💀
You
are
the
smartest
boy
out
there
.
And
you
are
mine
.
🥰
[sskarz]
What
other
girl
could
it
POSSIBLY
be
😂
[prabipyakurel]
idk
i
was
so
scared
it
was
gonna
be
someone
else
[sskarz]
I
’
m
going
to
be
yours
forever
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
ready
for
you
to
be
like
,
well
this
girl
(
girls
name
)
is
blah
blah
blah
.
Correct
!
[sskarz]
Literally
that
would
’
ve
just
been
impossible
for
you
to
figure
out
,
I
wouldn
’
t
even
have
bothered
going
through
all
that
riddle
trouble
😂
But
it
was
you
and
I
was
unsure
of
how
you
felt
at
the
time
so
I
did
something
stupid
and
made
a
stupidly
easy
riddle
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
when
you
wouldnt
give
up
the
name
I
had
a
feeling
either
i
knew
the
person
or
it
was
me
.
It
was
so
amazing
,
I
will
remember
the
night
you
sent
it
and
solved
it
both
.
[sskarz]
There
’
s
no
one
better
than
you
so
that
possibility
was
never
going
to
be
true
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
there
was
no
name
on
that
riddle
.
There
is
no
boy
out
there
that
deserves
a
place
in
ly
life
other
than
you
and
you
remember
that
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
*
except
I
forgot
the
key
detail
being
that
thee
means
you
but
yk
😭*
😂
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
a
little
dumb
but
thats
how
i
solved
it
and
i
was
like
okay
,
either
he
is
going
to
tell
me
its
me
,
or
i
will
slowly
move
away
from
him
.
[sskarz]
Hahaha
well
it
must
’
ve
gave
you
some
piece
of
mind
Oh
thank
god
I
confessed
early
[prabipyakurel]
It
hit
me
,
when
you
sent
that
,
a
part
of
my
brain
went
,
"
omg
he
likes
me
"
No
I
am
glad
you
did
,
because
a
week
after
that
,
I
saw
you
in
person
.
[sskarz]
uh
,
you
got
a
dependent
clause
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
the
sentence
before
the
comma
is
fine
that
’
s
an
independent
clause
,
but
after
the
comma
is
when
that
dependent
clause
starts
but
never
ends
properly
,
thus
making
it
an
incomplete
sentence
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
professor
thapa
,
I
will
note
that
down
.
[sskarz]
there
we
go
,
now
it
’
s
fixed
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
wonder
my
brother
thinks
you
type
so
formally
[sskarz]
Ew
just
call
me
sanskar
or
your
mans
or
boyfriend
,
not
professor
😂
[prabipyakurel]
mans
?
[sskarz]
Your
man
*
[prabipyakurel]
stop
being
like
one
then
[sskarz]
yk
what
I
mean
haha
[prabipyakurel]
leave
me
and
my
english
alone
[sskarz]
But
it
’
s
funny
to
mess
with
you
love
🥰
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
is
And
I
love
you
for
that
❤
️
[sskarz]
also
it
just
reminded
me
of
the
SATs
And
that
was
some
shit
I
had
to
study
😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
my
man
and
will
remain
my
one
and
only
man
.
❤
️
😂
Damn
it
was
just
the
link
[sskarz]
really
winning
out
here
[prabipyakurel]
I
saw
it
though
[sskarz]
yeah
the
gif
didn
’
t
work
properly
😭
[prabipyakurel]
I
hate
it
when
that
happens
its
so
dumb
You
won
over
my
heart
and
stayed
in
there
2

[sskarz]
Maybe

both
go
to
an
eyebrow
clinic
together
for
our
date
😂
[prabipyakurel]
My
mom
does
mine
💀
that
would
not
be
a
bad
idea
tho
[sskarz]
Same
,
but
if
I
have
to
do
it
secretly
without
being
asked
:
oh
sanskar
you
’
re
putting
effort
into
your
looks
,
who
are
you
seeing
hmmmmm
?
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
lol
isnt
that
nice
no
sometimes
my
brother
does
that
and
puts
extra
time
into
looking
nice
and
my
dad
and
my
mom
and
me
just
have
to
comment
on
it
[sskarz]
God

Prabi
we
are
doing
something
way
more
fun
and
romantic
than
that
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
like
buddy
you
got
someone
or
something
😂
No
yea
for
sure
,
the
last
thing
i
want
is
to
get
our
eyebrows
done
together
and
you
are
just
there
screaming
everytime
a
piece
of
your
eyebrows
are
being
pulled
out
.
💀
[sskarz]
That
would
low
key
be
hilarious
hahaha
Maybe
when
we
can
be
more
comfortable
around
each
other
like
physically
we
can
do
small
things
like
that
together
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]

it
threaded

t

my
uncle

fr
the

person
[sskarz]
💀
[prabipyakurel]

OH
okay
then
do
what
you
want
with
him
[sskarz]
his
name
is
Joseph
,
super
cool
dude
and
he
and
I
work
well
together
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhh
gotcha
[sskarz]
I
go
into
the
gym
,
I
tell
him
what
I
wanna
work
on
,
whether
it
be
an
entire
workout
or
my
form
with
something
or
even
just
general
knowledge
about
stuff
,
he
keeps
track
of
my
progress
with
all
my
workouts
and
every
month
we
do
an
assessment
to
view
my
progress
He
pushes
me
to
my
absolute
limits
so
he
’
s
great
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
that
sounds
pretty
nice
.
I
know
that
you
do
your
absolute
best
and
you
will
continue
and
get
to
your
goal
,
i
believe
in
you
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
have
a
roadmap
that
I
set
with
him
,
and
we
are
on
pace
to
get
to
where
I
wanna
be
near
January
to
February
So
it
’
s
going
really
well
[prabipyakurel]
and
where
do
you
wanna
be
?
No

this
😉

I

I

to

[sskarz]
Keep
drinking

or
I
’
ll
message
you
randomly
to
tell
you
to
drink
water
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
today
I
went
to
my
history
class
from
5
-
5
:
30
and
I
was
like
its
in
the
evening
and
its
not
hot
outside
so
I
didnt
take
water
with
me
and
like
the
moment
I
sat
down
in
class
I
was
like
coughing
and
my
throat
was
itchy
.
I
was
like
shit
.
Usually
when
I
have
water
,
i
dont
need
it
and
today
i
wanted
water
and
I
just
didnt
have
it
with
me
.
I
will
remember
,
i
am
getting
better
.
[sskarz]
Bring
it
with
you
and
make
sure
you
drink
water
throughout
the
day
I
know
,
keep
at
it
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
I
will
bring
it
with
me
everywhere
now
I
think
yesterday
and
today
combined
I
finished
half
a
gallon
that
is
something
[sskarz]
Getting
better
You
do
a
lot
of
walking
so
drink
a
bit
more
than
that
But
you
’
re
getting
better
,
proud
of
you
👏
[prabipyakurel]

tuesdays
and
thursdays
thank
you
,
you
have
actually
helped
and
reminded
me
a
lot
❤
️

my
mom
,

be
calling
random
times
though
out
the
day
and
going
"
WATER

DID

DRINK
?"
[sskarz]

loves
you
so
much

Don

t

know
,
I
am
going
to
drink
water
so
no
one
will
have
to
worry
,
not
even
you
❤
️
No
yea
like
my
dad
reminds
me
too
,
but
he
does
it
in
that
sarcastic
way
when
I
drink
anything
other
than
water
,
"
yea
drink
that
for
the
rest
of
your
life
,
water
doesnt
exist
right
!"
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]

I

I
had
a
dream
that
there
was
this
virus
spreading
that
turned
people
into
zombies
and
stuff
and
I
was
trying
to
keep
myself
from
getting
infected
.
Then
I
had
a
dream
and
you
and
me
were
randomly
walking
and
woke
up
.
Kind
of
a
weird
night
[sskarz]
Oh
what
,
straight
out
of
the
walking
dead
or
something
A
bit
weird
for
sure
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No

were
just
brain
dead
,
didn
’
t
look
any
different
[sskarz]
Ohh
I
see
Weird
dreams

[prabipyakurel]
Yes
but
now
I
am
just
drinking
coffee
and
eating
a
granola
bar
[sskarz]
I
haven
’
t
been
able
to
get
out
of
bed
😭
[prabipyakurel]
No

[sskarz]
It
’
s

one
of
those
days
[prabipyakurel]
No

up
so
I

out
of
the
shower
and

bathroom
without
running
into
a
boy
or

showers
taken
over

pull
separate

[prabipyakurel]
No
you
are
never
,
I
was
waiting
for
you
because
I
assumed
you
would
be
driving
home
.
My
day
was
nice
,
I
attended
office
hours
for
math
,
reviewed
a
little
for
tomorrow
'
s
quiz
,
then
went
to
the
math
lecture
and
came
back
,
pretty
much
it
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
oh
that
'
s
pretty
good
,
you
feeling
good
about
this
next
quiz
?
today
was
like
unironically
the
most
boring
but
also
funny
day
ever
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
still
a
little
scared
but
I
think
I
got
it
.
[sskarz]
you
got
it
love
,
I
know
you
prepared
well
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
me
all
about
it
.
I
love
you
so
much
,
ty
,
I
will
try
my
best
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
yeah
so
basically
,
after
my
boring
english
class
in
which
i
napped
for
a
bit
(
jk
jk
,
just
boring
),
went
to
the
library
and
chilled
out
for
3
hours
and
had
lunch
,
then
had
another
class
that
was
interesting
and
difficult
math
stuff
,
but
i
was
expecting
my
lsat
class
to
be
a
total
snore
this
last
class
that
i
had
,
it
'
s
been
SO
boring
the
last
3
weeks
right
today
,
my
professor
didn
'
t
change
anything
,
except
there
were
like
5
students
that
didn
'
t
do
the
stuff
from
last
class
,
or
not
properly
anyway
for
the
setup
for
today
'
s
class
,
so
the
class
was
just
recapping
for
them
.
Why
?
Because
my
teacher
is
super
slow
,
and
he
has
a
THICK
asian
accent
and
people
can
'
t
understand
him
really
and
it
made
for
the
most
hilarious
moments
today
My
professor
got
so
fed
up
of
trying
to
help
these
students
navigate
their
computer
,
he
started
yelling
and
laughing
at
them
,
and
my
friend
and
i
were
DYING
in
the
front
row
of
class
we
laughed
so
hard
we
started
crying
because
it
was
that
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
what
a
professor
,
i
mean
if
he
had
a
thick
asian
accent
and
started
yelling
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
,
I
would
be
laughing
too
.
You
should
have
taken
a
picture
of
yourself
,
you
probably
looked
so
dumb
crying
while
laughing
😂
but
that
feeling
is
good
yk
[sskarz]
im
not
lying
prabi
,
we
had
an
hour
and
a
half
for
class
.
the
stuff
we
did
today
would
'
ve
took
MAX
20
minutes
if
everyone
just
did
it
on
their
own
[prabipyakurel]
omg
damn
[sskarz]
it
was
a
nice
change
of
pace
😂
no
like
i
was
so
hyped
for
this
class
because
its
supposed
to
be
a
lot
of
teamwork
,
and
like
we
are
all
supposed
to
work
on
a
singular
project
the
entire
semester
to
then
present
it
at
the
end
we
haven
'
t
,
even
made
groups
yet
and
its
been
3
WEEKS
i
'
ve
got
no
faith
in
this
professor
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
fr
so
slow
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
seemed
like
you
had
a
fun
class
tho
thanks
to
those
5
students
[sskarz]
for
once
,
yeah
i
felt
kinda
bad
afterwards
,
i
didn
'
t
want
them
to
think
that
i
was
laughing
at
them
[prabipyakurel]
well
they
probably
did
idiot
[sskarz]
but
i
was
just
laughing
at
the
fact
that
the
professor
started
getting
frustrated
hahaha
eh
it
is
what
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
lol
no
i
was
kidding
,
no
they
probably
understood
why
you
were
dying
there
[sskarz]
i
showed
my
professor
the
work
for
the
class
,
and
he
was
like
,
alright
for
those
of
you
that
already
did
this
stuff
,
leave
and
those
that
haven
'
t
stay
and
i
just
left
out
the
door
in
like
30
minutes
[prabipyakurel]
Genius
[sskarz]
its
probably
gonna
be
an
easy
A
,
but
i
won
'
t
learn
anything
in
there
[prabipyakurel]
meh
its
alright
,
just
go
with
the
flow
.
[sskarz]
its
the
most
basic
shit
prabi
,
i
have
3rd
year
compsci
majors
in
my
class
that
don
'
t
know
how
to
navigate
a
macbook
😭
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
,
they
are
3rd
year
students
?
[sskarz]
true
but
i
like
learning
new
things
,
oh
well
I
'
ll
take
an
easy
A
👍
that
is
a
3rd
and
4th
level
class
💀
its
high
key
embarrassing
[prabipyakurel]
tbh
i
have
never
used
a
macbook
so
I
probably
wont
know
how
to
navigate
though
it
either
lol
[sskarz]
but
ur
not
a
compsci
major
so
ur
fine
👍
as
a
person
that
lives
and
breathes
computers
like
howwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
a
little
sad
but
i
mean
maybe
they
are
struggling
with
something
[sskarz]
like
they
didn
'
t
know
how
to
save
their
file
😭
yeah
true
,
but
idk
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
okay
that
is
bad
,
even
I
KNOW
THAT
,
and
that
is
saying
something
[sskarz]
again
im
not
laughing
at
them
,
not
totally
anyway
,
mostly
just
at
the
professor
lol
my
friend
norma
and
i
were
just
laughing
so
hard
,
and
even
the
professor
was
like
,
"
stop
laughing
!"
and
he
kept
on
laughing

20
times
today
and
talking
to
you
[sskarz]
oooooooh

me
some
of
the
problems
i
wanna
see
if
i
can
do
them
[prabipyakurel]
I
finished
todays
summary
,
and
2
readings
,
and
worked
more
in
the
sociology
project
well
...
they
are
already
done
but
sure
[sskarz]
that
'
s
my
hardworking
queen
right
there
one
of
the
infinite
reasons
why
i
love
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
ty
ty
,
i
love
you
I
have
done
these
before
,
I
just
feel
like
I
will
miss
a
step
tomorrow
They
pretty
simple
[sskarz]
omg
i
remember
this
stuff
😂
i
hated
doing
these
because
it
took
so
much
space
on
a
page
to
do
a
single
problem
😭
[prabipyakurel]
These
are
my
favorite
type
of
problems
No
but
fr
they
do
take
up
so
much
space
And
my
handwriting
is
a
little
big
,
so
I
take
up
a
lot
of
space
to
write
[sskarz]
its
so
much
conversion
and
like
factoring
[prabipyakurel]
factoring
is
fun
[sskarz]
wait
till
you
get
to
derivative
problems
,
so
much
easier
and
takes
little
space
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
its
just
some
wont
factor
and
thats
when
i
get
mad
No
yea
I
hope
so
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
know
that
feeling
too
well
😂
[prabipyakurel]
you
are
right
handed
right
?
[sskarz]
yes
ma
'
am
[prabipyakurel]
ahhh
gotcha
[sskarz]
wait
y
[prabipyakurel]
no
just
asking
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
🤔
are
you
right
handed
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
am
[sskarz]
ah
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
why
did
you
ask
like
that
lol
😂
[sskarz]
it
is
just
a
question
that
feels
so
out
of
place
in
our
convo
so
i
was
like
huh
?
haha
but
i
mean
now
u
know
i
guess
[prabipyakurel]
it
just
popped
up
in
my
head
[sskarz]
no
no
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
soooooooooooooooooooo
[sskarz]
sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[prabipyakurel]
what
are
you
doing
?
i
am
gonna
slap
you
one
day
i
swear
😂
[sskarz]
i
was
watching
an
anime
,
which
is
weird
because
i
haven
'
t
watched
an
anime
in
a
really
long
time
well
i
'
ve
already
watched
it
before
,
just
rewatching
[prabipyakurel]
wow
as
interesting
as
that
sounds
,
do
you
not
have
anything
else
to
watch
?
😂
[sskarz]
omg
you
'
re
such
a
haterrrrrrr
hahaha
its
one
of
my
favorite
shows
ever
,
one
of
my
favorite
love
stories
i
'
ve
ever
watched
[prabipyakurel]
oh
its
a
love
story
,
what
is
it
about
?
[sskarz]
one
day
im
gonna
wrap
you
in
my
arms
and
force
you
to
watch
an
anime
😂
❤
️
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
no
for
sure
anytime
,
I
will
fall
asleep
on
you
and
you
can
finish
watching
it
on
your
own
😂
[sskarz]
well
its
a
love
story
that
doesn
'
t
end
well
,
it
'
s
got
a
really
really
heart
wrenching
story
win
win
for
me
;)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
yikes
,
no
some
stories
are
really
good
,
but
its
just
the
ending
that
messes
with
me
sometimes
yk
awwww
you
are
the
sweetest
person
ever
,
lol
it
would
be
a
win
win
for
me
too
.
[sskarz]
no
yeahhhh
,
well
since
we
probably
won
'
t
watch
it
together
soon
,
its
about
a
guy
and
a
girl
that
meet
and
fall
out
of
love
through
crazy
action
events
,
and
they
start
to
learn
how
to
live
with
each
other
'
s
feelings
.
Except
the
story
takes
place
in
a
cyberpunk
universe
and
the
main
protaganist
does
anything
for
the
security
of
his
love
,
so
he
sacrifices
himself
for
her
safety
in
the
end
anyway
it
made
me
full
on
cry
i
remember
watching
the
ending
and
i
had
so
many
tears
running
down
😂
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
,
no
thats
kinda
sad
.
I
have
watched
a
lot
of
movies
when
someone
dies
and
I
have
to
look
away
from
the
TV
so
I
dont
cry
like
crazy
I
would
sacrifice
myself
for
my
love
any
day
,
anytime
and
do
anything
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
would
do
anything
for
you
,
even
if
it
means
I
have
to
push
everything
away
for
you
❤

song

when
we
start

together
you
will
have
a
crying
buddy
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
and
it
just
summarizes
the
entire
show
and
their
relationship
[prabipyakurel]
I

much
,
I
wont
let
you
hurt

for
me
tho
.

️
[prabipyakurel]
I

bad
happen
to
me
,
everything
bad
stays
away
from
you

.
I

️
this

[prabipyakurel]
Then

its
making
you
cry
,
idk
dont
listen
to
it
[sskarz]
it
just
be
so
good
👍
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
because
you
have
watched
the
show
and
watched
what
happened
,
you
probably
cry
thinking
of
the
scene
[sskarz]
oh
no
yeah
totally
if
you
don
'
t
know
what
happens
in
the
show
,
then
its
a
good
song
but
after
you
realize
,
its
like
man
.
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,

I
understand
,
some
songs
connect
to
somethings
and
it
is
sad
.

its
an
ugly
trip
and
I
usually
knock
something
over
and
fall
on
my
face
.
It
will
not
be
a
cute
,
"
catch
me
love
"
type
of
thing
.

have
breakfast
with

,
fall
on

the
top
of
my
bucket
list

the
only
factor
,

only
factor

[prabipyakurel]
Seeing
your
texts
and
talking
to
you
is
part
of
my
daily
routine
,
and
has
been
ever
since
we
started
talking
and
will
continue
.
❤
️
Its
amazing
and
out
of
everyone

🥰
[sskarz]
I

YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
its
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
so
much
sanskar
,
and
I
would
have
never
thought
this
would
have
been
possible
,
but
here
we
are
.
❤
️
it
really
is
,
you
know
it
reminds
me
of
something
actually
.
so
,
before
I
graduated
like
during
prom
week
,
in
our
AP
government
class
,
everyone
was
talking
about
who
they
were
going
to
prom
with
and
then
when
they
asked
me
I
was
like
"
uh
dont
know
,
dont
really
like
anyone
,
and
I
told
them
I
would
probably
go
alone
.
And
then
my
ap
government
teacher
was
all
like
Prabi
it
may
not
seem
like
you
like
anyone
now
,
but
trust
me
when
you
go
to
berkeley
you
will
find
a
nepali
boy
just
for
you
,
and
I
thought
she
was
crazy
for
thinking
I
would
be
dating
someone
right
after
high
school
.
But
being
here
with
you
and
talking
to
you
and
falling
in
love
with
you
has
really
been
willd
and
been
so
amazing
.
I
love
you
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
hahaha
they
were
telling
the
truth
after
all
,
and
it
happened
right
as
you
went
to
berkeley
❤
️
who
would
'
ve
thought
:)
so
glad
I
didn
'
t
miss
my
chance
😂
but
that
'
s
amazing
,
you
'
re

riddle

I
am
telling
you

next
day
I

be
the
only
one
.

[prabipyakurel]
Oh

bad
?
[sskarz]
well
the
big
one
was
that
California
was
on
fire
and
it
burned
our
entire
area
down
so
we
had
to
leave
everything
behind
kind
of
ordeal
[prabipyakurel]
omg
,
damn
[sskarz]
Yeah

felt
so
real
too
That
one
spooked
me

[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

it
was

’
s
like
the
most
common
one
[prabipyakurel]

Well
I
fell
asleep
around
11
:
00
but
like
strangely
woke
up
at
exactly
3
:
11
because
I
remember
the
time
very
well
.
Like
I
just
woke
up
and
was
like
,
I
just
can
'
t
go
back
to
sleep
now
,
I
was
really
going
to
go
down
from
my
bunk
bed
at
3
:
11
Am
and
go
brush
and
everything
.
I
just
had
like
the
most
energy
for
like
30
minutes
.
But
lol
I
didnt
do
that
,
I
passed
out
the
next
second
.
[sskarz]
Oh
what
that
’
s
so
odd
,
glad
you
went
back
to
sleep
tho
❤
️
It
would
’
ve
been
rough
for
you
in
your
classes
today
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
sometimes
I
dont
even
need
like
a
bad
dream
,
I
will
get
up
all
scared
and
it
will
just
be
the
scariest
feeling
.
No
fr
,
glad
I
didnt
just
come
down
and
sit
at
my
desk
from
3
in
the
morning
.
[sskarz]
Text
me
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
I
’
ll
wake
up
with
sentience
and
help
you
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
you
are
so
sweet
and
adorable
,
if
I
ever
feel
really
scared
,
I
will
.
❤
️
you
know
I
have
actually
done
that
[sskarz]
Really
?
[prabipyakurel]
not
to
you
but
to
one
of
my
friends
[sskarz]
Oh
okay
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
so
,
what
happened
was
after
I
was
done
texting
you
,
it
was
like
a
week
after
july
4th
,
and
it
was
a
wednesday
or
something
and
I
had
a
dream
that
there
were
people
and
dogs
chasing
me
down
the
street
and
every
house
that
I
would
go
to
the
doors
would
not
open
and
like
I
was
just
panicking
and
running
.
But
then
I
tripped
or
something
and
woke
up
.
I
was
so
scared
,
I
could
not
even
get
up
to
turn
on
the
light
.
I
had
never
felt
that
way
before
,
so
like
I
opened
discord
and
realized
that
one
of
my
friends
saira
would
normally
be
up
past
12
,
so
I
messaged
her
like
an
entire
paragraph
and
told
her
to
just
talk
to
me
because
I
was
really
scared
.
But
then
after
like
5
minutes
of
sending
that
,
I
just
deleted
the
message
,
I
didnt
want
to
disturb
her
.
Then
I
put
together
the
courage
to
walk
down
the
hall
to
my
parents
and
went
there
to
"
drink
water
"
because
they
have
a
water
jug
.
And
my
dad
was
like
,
did
you
have
a
nightmare
,
and
I
just
talked
to
them
a
little
bit
(
not
about
the
nightmare
)
just
general
,
and
it
felt
better
.
I
still
remember
that
night
,
it
was
pretty
scary
,
I
didnt
know
what
to
do
.
[sskarz]
Omg
that
does
sound
really
terrifying
Well
if
that
happens
again
,
don
’
t
be
afraid
to
text
me
,
you
can
text
me
and
call
me
whenever
you
need
to

❤
️
[sskarz]
hehehe
cutieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
pie
also
how
did
you
do
on
your
quiz
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
think
I
messed
up
on
one
,
it
’
s
kind
of
scary
[sskarz]
oh
you
don
'
t
know
your
score
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
because
she
solves
the
questions
at
the
end
but
I
am
not
sure
if
the
answer
she
got
was
the
exact
one
I
answered
It
seems
similar
[sskarz]
you
probably
got
it
right
[prabipyakurel]
Ty
ty
,
I
hope
so
too
.
Have
you
had
dinner
?
[sskarz]
not
yet
,
probably
gonna
skip
out
on
it
tonight
[prabipyakurel]
Think
about
it
buddy
,
food
is
good
,
and
what
if
your
mom
made
something
good
huh
[sskarz]
i
mean
maybe
but
like
im
not
really
hungry
yk
wbu
?
have
you
had
dinner
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
almost
done
I
had
chicken
Tika
masala
,
samosas
basmati
rice
and
crab
salad
It
not
bad
[sskarz]
ooooooooooh
yes
that
sounds
pretty
good
[prabipyakurel]
The
chicken
can
use
more
seasoning
but
considering
they
have
been
giving
only
beef
for
the
past
2
days
This
is
amazing
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
damn
aren
'
t
there
any
other
halls
that
don
'
t
just
serve
beef
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
going
to
walk
across
campus
to
the
other
dining
hall
for
food
options
Lol
I
will
eat
a
tuna
or
turkey
sandwich
[sskarz]
oh
its
that
far
?
that
kinda
sucks
[prabipyakurel]
Because
there
are
4
dining
halls
around
campus
and
the
other
ones
are
pretty
far
[sskarz]
awwww
have
you
tried
the
other
ones
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
it
’
s
the
same
food
,
just
rotates
So
like
this
menu
will
be
in
one
of
the
other
ones
for
tomorrow
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
damn
that
is
kinda
disappointing
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
some
say
it
’
s
better
at
some
other
one
But
like
I
don
’
t
got
time
for
that
[sskarz]
anyways
whatchu
doin
[prabipyakurel]
Walking

[prabipyakurel]
Is
it

to
eat
crab
and
root
beer
together
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
no
idea
..

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

a
different
story
,
but
most
likely
if
I
got
nothing
to

I
find
something
or
go
to
bed
,
stare
at
the
ceiling
until
i
pass
out
[sskarz]
Ok

close
ur

😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

at
the
ceiling
till
sleep
comes
over
?
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
,
no
i
have
my
eyes
open
,
usually
just
thinking
about
something
until
I
cant
keep
my
eyes
open
then
I
switch
to
the
fetal
position
and
sleep
and
keep
turning
left
and
right
till

a
sweet
spot
[sskarz]
Ohhhh

stare
at
the
ceiling
with
their
eyes

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

was
when
you
mentioned
your
toy
car
collection
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
i
had
to
look
deeply
into
the
cats
eyes
[sskarz]
Haha
it
’
s
so
cute
[prabipyakurel]
I
wished
those
hearts
were
for
me
at
that
time
😂
😂
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
give
you
all
the
hearts
❤
️
Any
day
every
day
[prabipyakurel]
Nah

i
saw
that
every
fat
lmao
[sskarz]
OMG
iPhone
I
’
m
gonna
kill
it
U
know
how
when
u
text
Like
the
3
suggestions
above
the
keyboard
I
accidentally
tapped
one
as
I
sent
And
it
was
that
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[sskarz]
I
swear
to
god
[prabipyakurel]
been
through
it
so
much
i
understand
lol
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
terrible
I
’
m
ready
to
switch
back
to
android
lol
[prabipyakurel]
you
were
once
an
android
user
?
[sskarz]
Always
[prabipyakurel]
Judging
you
😂
[sskarz]
This
is
my
first
time
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
[sskarz]
Having
an
iPhone
as
my
daily
phone
In
nearly
12
years
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
yea
some
of
my
friends
have
android
phones
and
I
always
look
at
it
like
how
the
hell
do
you
use
thing
thing
thats
a
pretty
long
time
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
I
’
ve
been
using
the
iPhone
for
like
11
months
it
’
s
been
good
like
actually
jokes
aside
I
wouldn
’
t
mind
android
or
iPhone
,
both
have
pros
and
cons
but
sometimes
I
’
m
like
,
apple
whyyyyyy
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
i
was
messing
with
you
,
android
has
got
its
reasons
,
but
seriously
sometimes
apple
really
be
a
pain
in
the
ass
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
’
s
really
not
that
complicated
lol
I
think
the
reason
people
think
like
that
about
android
is
because
there
are
so
many
more
options
to
do
stuff
that
it
gets
overwhelming
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
not
,
but
I
have
been
so
used
to
apple
,
and
some
android
phones
are
actually
confusing
believe
me
Yea
maybe
[sskarz]
iPhone
is
definitely
simpler
to
use
That
’
s
why
many
people
like
it
Just
for
that
reason
But
I
’
m
a
tech
nerd
so
I
gotta
try
out
everything
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
took
my
friends
android
phone
with
the
pattern
password
thing
and
used
to
just
keep
trying
until
it
disabled
his
phone
💀
i
feel
so
bad
now
[sskarz]
Actual
menace
wtf
LOL
I
’
ve
seen
android
phones
being
locked
out
for
like
years
😭
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
do
you
,
try
everything
and
be
the
genius
you
were
born
to
be
[sskarz]
Oh
please
love
,
I
was
not
born
a
genius
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
fr
pissed
him
off
sometimes
and
I
just
sat
there
looking
at
him
and
said
sorry
like
a
fool
😂
[sskarz]

and

all
sorry
"
😭
[sskarz]
I
just
realized
that

more
threatening
than
reassuring
💀
I

that
Canadian
blood
in
me
fr
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No

didnt
sound
mean
lol

Make
sure
you
’
re
fed
first
Then
take
it
With
appropriate
doses
,
and
then
drink
tons
of
water
That
should
help
with
some
of
the
pain
[prabipyakurel]
Am
I
supposed
to
take
that
with
food
?
I
just
eat

[prabipyakurel]
My

pretty
much
the

?
[sskarz]
well
i
didn
'
t
have
the
cake
so
i
have
no
idea
if
it
was
good
or
not
,
its
just
i
felt
so
full
from
the
food
i
already
had
there
i
didn
'
t
feel
like
adding
more
into
my
stomach
after
eating
a
lot
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhh
i
see
no
that
is
a
smart
thing
to
do
[sskarz]
yeah
also
didn
'
t
go
to
the
gym
today
so
i
didn
'
t
want
to
overload
my
stomach
and
feel
terrible
tomorrow
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
gotcha
,
yea
you
dont
wanna
over
eat
,
especially
with
sweets
i
should
be
taking
my
own
advice
sometimes
omg
[sskarz]
hahaha
just
looking
out
for
myself
,
if
i
get
into
sweets
i
will
not
stop
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
you
the
smart
one
for
sure
,
did
i
mention
i
ate
like
more
than
6
mini
cupcakes
yesterday
😂
and
the
cake
too
[sskarz]
omg
[prabipyakurel]
and
before
i
left
their
house

right
[sskarz]
i
mean

what
you
want

not
gonna
stop
you

long
as
you
'
re

for
it
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

I
felt

maybe
a
little
too
great
[sskarz]

sugar
high
[prabipyakurel]
but
i
ate
one
when
I

,
and
i
felt
better
,
so
i
was
like
,
its
medicine
😤
😂
No

your
stomach
just
needed
a
little
something
to
make
it
happy
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
Fr
it
got
tired
of
the
dining
hall
food
[sskarz]

mid
ass
food
is
upsetting
you

hearing
is
i
'
m
gonna
give
you
lots
of
sweets
as
a
gift
:)
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
[sskarz]
it
can
be

of
it
[prabipyakurel]
you
can
literally
give
me
a
hersheys
bar
and
I
will
literally
give
you
the
tighest
hug
[sskarz]
so
if
i

your
embrace
i
wont
lie

a
little
tired

And

bit
.
Lol

s
it
,
and

ve
gotta
find
time
to
go
to
the
gym
today
Wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
Just
going
to
work
on
my
project
,
I
should
be
going
to
the
library
but
I
don
’
t
know
if
I
can
actually
.
And
I
got
auditions
at
3
for
the
tour
thing
and
that
’
s
pretty
much
it
.
I
don
’
t
even
know
how
imma
get
that
done
.
I
can
’
t
stop
coughing
and
sniffling
[sskarz]
Hey
don
’
t
force
yourself
,
if
you
can
’
t
go
then
don
’
t
go
Recover
first
then
worry
about
that
later
is
there
any
cough
medicine
that
you
could
get
?
like
at
Walgreens
or
a
nearby
cvs
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
Walgreens
is
nearby
,
I
got
like
cinnamon
and
stuff
from
my
aunts
yesterday
,
just
going
to
heat
up
hot
water
,
put
in
a
tea
bad
and
just
drink
it
[sskarz]
If
u
can
get
some
medicine
too
,
it
will
clear
up
ur
sinuses
[prabipyakurel]
I
won
’
t
love
,
dw
,
I
will
only
go
if
I
can
,
love
you
!
❤
️
Yea
possibly
,
maybe
I
will
do
that
.
[sskarz]
I
love
you
too
!
❤
️
Good
,
but
rest
if
you
need
it
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
I
think
the
Covid
spread
in
this
are
is
still
high
,
so
many
people
are
missing
from
classes
and
stuff
and
everyone
is
kinda
just
sick
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
I
see
You
could
’
ve
been
caught
up
in
the
wave
[prabipyakurel]
Most
likely
,
like
yesterday
morning
it
wasn
’
t
bad
,
but
like
in
the
afternoon
,
even
though
my
windows
were
closed
,
I
needed
to
put
on
a
jacket
because
I
felt
cold
,
I
think
that
’
s
when
it
really
kind
of
started
[sskarz]
flu
season
is
coming
up
too
so
that
is
also
probably
the
reason
But
hey
,
keep
yourself
warm
and
drink
lots
of
water
,
and
take
medicine
if
you
can
and
rest
for
today
Make
sure
you
eat
nutrient
rich
foods
too
,
your
body
will
recover
quicker
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
,
and
yes
I
have
gotten
better
at
drinking
more
water
.
❤
️
No
I
will
watch
my
food
choices
for
a
while
I
think
ever
since
I
got
to
Berkeley
,
I
have
been
sick
like
twice
Maybe
this
is
the
3rd
time
actually
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
tough
to
get
adjusted
It
’
s
okay
,
you
’
re
going

be
just
fine
Just
rest
for
today

it
easy

that
grading

assignments
,
i
love
those
kinds
of
professors
[prabipyakurel]
no
this
professor
is
awesome
[sskarz]
they
'
re
usually
more
lenient
on
stuff
and
its
just
easier
[prabipyakurel]
he
is
like
good
at
captivating
during
lectures
some
just
go
on
and
on
and
I

there
struggling

his
grades
(

that
weekly
),
and
then
I
yelled
at
him
to
get
it
fixed
,
and
lol
i
didnt
know
that
it
was
the
teachers
mistake
,
kinda
felt
bad
for
yelling
at
him
but
lol
i
did
anyways
.
And
he
just
got
it
all
up
again
.
[sskarz]

**
death
stare

and
starts
slapping
me
with
a
croc

[prabipyakurel]
No

but
why
would
you
mention
that
in
front
of
the
other
sibling
[sskarz]
i
like
pissing
her
off
:)
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
do
the
same
,
just
not
with
shoes

they
are
in
the
garage
,
so
its
usually
something
in
the
kitchen
💀
i
am
sure
you
do
[sskarz]
omg
today
we
were
talking
about
my
sister
'
s
non
existant
love
life
[prabipyakurel]

huh
😂
[sskarz]
and
she
was
like
,
uh
sanskar
ur
gonna
get
a
girl
just
like
me
,
because
look
at
how
mamu
and
papa
turned
out
and

u
and
me
and
i
was
like
**
hell

,
i
'
d
rather
die
**
needless
to
say
i
was
chased
around
the
house
afterwards
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
why
do
you
do
that
to
your
sister
,
she
is
so
pretty
,
she
will
get
someone
in
no
time
.
Stop
doing
that
to
her
I
would
chase
my
brother
around
the
house
if
those
words
fell
out
of
his
mouth
😂
[sskarz]
no
love
this
is
how
we
treat
each
other
haha
,
we
both
know
its
no
bad
blood
and
we
wish
the
best
for
each
other
.
we
just
like
messing
around
[prabipyakurel]
in
fact
,
mamu
would
as
well
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
it
can
be
fun
at
times
[sskarz]
if
you
lived
with
me
,
you
wouldn
'
t
believe
the
amount
of
times
we
trash
talk
each
other
throughout
the
day
if
we
can
lol
its
just
something
we
do
[prabipyakurel]
nah
uh
,
I
can
imagine
it
,
trust
me
,
you
would
not
last
a
day
with
just
me
and
my
brother
you
would
probably
grab
popcorn
and
sit
in
the
sofa
and
go
"
altight
,
here
we
go
"!!!
😂
[sskarz]
would
be
a
great
show
tbh
😂
i
love
seeing
interactions
between
siblings
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
would
be
randomly
laying
on
the
sofa
like
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
he
would
just
sit
next
to
me
and
use
his
legs
to
push
me
off
for
no
reason
like
wtf
what
did
i
do
to
you
[sskarz]
💀
i
do
that
shit
too
i
won
'
t
lie
😂
😂
its
just
that
brotherly
urge
yk
?
gotta
mess
with
the
older
sister
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
no
and
I
am
tiny
,
so
when
that
dude
pushes
me
or
gives
me
a
slight
nudge
,
I
GO
FLYING
😂
i
am
being
serious
[sskarz]
LMAO
that
is
actually
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
sometimes
you
just
wanna
like
...
[sskarz]
its
funny
thooooo
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
i
run
to
parents
telling
them
that
HE
HIT
ME
[sskarz]
we
just
love
messing
with
you
:)
[prabipyakurel]
and
they
believe
me
,

[sskarz]

a
snitch
💀
[prabipyakurel]
No

I
am
[sskarz]
nahhhhhhh

😂
[prabipyakurel]
He
doesnt
even
have
to
hit
me
,
if
i
am
mad
at
him
,
I
will
go
to
my
dad
and
be
like
"
baba
he
hit
me
,
the
death
stare
my
dad
gives
my
brother
"
and
I
walk
away
like
a
boss
[sskarz]
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ur
power
is
too
great
[prabipyakurel]
not
me
[sskarz]
there
needs
to
be
some
power
rebalancing
there
😂
[prabipyakurel]
i
love
it
,
they
take
my
side
[sskarz]
if
my
sister
says
i
did
shit
,
im
fighting
for
my
life
💀
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
your
parents
yell
at
you
too
[sskarz]
thankfully
i
don
'
t
do
anything
crazy
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
they
dont
hear
your
side
of
the
story
[sskarz]
nah
it
just
becomes
a
free
for
all
,
parents
will
yell
at
us
and
at
themselves
too
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
no
i
love
it
when
they
do
that
"
god
what
kind
of
children
did
you
give
me
"
[sskarz]
like
one
parent
will
take
someone
'
s
side
and
then
the
other
parent
disagrees
and
it
goes
from
yelling
at
us
siblings
to
yelling
at
the
other
parent
for
giving
in
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
usually
its
my
mom
that
yells
at
my
dad
because
he
likes
to
joke
around
too
😂
[prabipyakurel]
no
that
is
when
things
get
interesting
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
be
yelled
at
for
loving
u
like
crazy
soooooooooooooooo
[prabipyakurel]
yea
dads
be
laughing
at
the
most
serious
moments
and
saying
the
most
funniest
things
😂
awww
no
you
really
cant
,
its
just
not
possible
does
your
dad
ever
get
mad
at
your
mom
and
when
she
says
something
,
he
is
trying
his
best
not
to
laugh
.
Like
sometimes
moms
be
getting
mad
and
it
is
the
funniest
thing
ever
[sskarz]
yeah
omg
like
almost
every
day
my
dad
LOVES
messing
with
my
mom
and
she
falls
for
it
everytime
[prabipyakurel]
its
hilarious
[sskarz]
she
married
someone
that
jokes
around
,
and
she
can
'
t
recognize
sosmething
is
a
joke
unless
its
blatant
💀
[prabipyakurel]
and
if
you
get
caught
laughing
at
your
mom
when
she
is
mad
,
she
automatically
start
with
,
"
i
carried
you
for
9
months
,
and
you
are
going
to
laugh
at
me
and
take
your
dads
side
"
lmao
[sskarz]
i
straight
up
say
,
yup
[prabipyakurel]
you
so
mean
[sskarz]
she
gets
stunned
by
my
answer
😂
but
she
knows
i
joke
around
so
i
hug
her
and
it
pisses
her
off
even
more
[prabipyakurel]
slippers
would
be
flying
all
over
the
place
for
the
day
no
no
,
when
moms
are
mad
,
you
dont
go
near
her
with
those
hugs
[sskarz]
no
she
'
s
usually
cooking
and
it
happens
in
the
mornings
,
so
she
'
ll
like
wave
the
spatula
around
and
i
run
😂
😂
no
like
she
pouts
and
its
the
cutest
thing
ever
😂
like
this
😂
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
that
is
what
my
mom
does
and
when
my
dad
goes
silent
like
that
,
she
just
keeps
teasing
him
like
she
didnt
just
yell
at
him
5
minutes
ago
for
messing
something
up
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
its
hilarious
i
love
how
brown
parents
all
act
the
same
way
😂
[prabipyakurel]
no
they
all
do
and
its
funny
as
hell
sometimes
you
are
just
there
like
,
yea
okay
[sskarz]
mhmm
yeah
its
great
but
its
great
now
,
if
i
was
still
a
kid
i
'
d
still
be
getting
my
ass
whooped
for
saying
certain
things
😂
so
i
don
'
t
miss
that
part
,
just
now
they
kinda
understand
humor
[prabipyakurel]
oh
you
are
so
right
,
like
if
i
said
some
of
the
things
i
say
now
like
a
few
years
back
,
ooooooo
that
is
ww3
😂
yea
no
you
and
me
and
every
nepali
kid
has
probably
gotten
yelled
at
and
hit
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
it
put
me
into
the
right
mindset
sometimes
so
i
don
'
t
take
it
for
granted
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yea
now
that
i
look
back
at
it
I
am
like
,
meh
thats
how
i
acted
,
so
that
is
what
i
got
[sskarz]
no
fr
anyway
,
have
u
have
lunch
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]

:
50
-
1
:
00

[sskarz]
my
sister

meeting
😭
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhh

,
and

dont
have
to
do
a
marathon
while
eating
[sskarz]

'
t
ever
bring
food
upstairs
one
of
the
rules
lol
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhhhhhhhh
i
see
[sskarz]
yea
unless
i
sneak
it
in
,
but
no
chance
that
'
s
happening
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
,
yea
I
thought
that
was
a
my
house
rule
type
of
thing
i
assumed
since
both
of
you
are
older
and
responsible
your
parents
would
be
okay
,
but
ig
not
[sskarz]
sometimes
they
are
okay
,
but
most
of
the
time
no
if
its
like
a
snack
like
a
protein
bar
or
shake
or
something
,
then
its
fine
.
but
not
like
a
full
meal
lol
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
are
probably
clumsy
so
thats
why
😂
jk
jk
[sskarz]
mmmmmmmmmmm
nuh
uhhhhhhhhhh
haha
[prabipyakurel]
you
bringing
your
gourmet
meal
upstairs
[sskarz]

time
but

don
'
t
know
about
it
lol
gourmet
💀
😂

but
tbh
i
'
d
rather
eat
downstairs
cuz
i
get
to
talk
to
the
family
and
u
know
chill
out
its
nice
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
its
more
comfortable
down
stairs
and
you
have
all
carpet
upstairs
right
?
hard
to
get
anything
off
that
thing
[sskarz]
yeah
i
do
it
stains
and
once
its
stained
,
its
not
getting
off
[prabipyakurel]
yep
lol
but
how
long
is
your
meeting
?
[sskarz]
its
supposed
to
just
go
to
1
so
like
maybe
30
more
mins
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
[sskarz]
but
i
'
m
not
even
supposed
to
be
in
it
,
its
all
finance
stuff
but
they
called
the
entire
board
[prabipyakurel]
its
30
minutes
you
will
be
fine
[sskarz]
so
im
just
sitting
here
like
,
i
don
'
t
really
care
lol
i
just
wanna
eat
😭
[prabipyakurel]
damn
drink
water
a
wise
person
once
told
me
sometimes
you
feel
hungry
but
you
just
need
water
[sskarz]
mhmmmmmm
i
would
love
to
i
ran
out
of
water
💀
[prabipyakurel]
how
dare
you
,
here
you
are
telling
me
,
no
go
drink
water
,
make
sure
you
have
water
[sskarz]
both
of
my
bottles
are
empty
😭
[prabipyakurel]
awww
its
like
a
big
one
and
a
mini
one
[sskarz]

the
big
one
is
for
in
home
,
the
small
one
is
for
the
gym
[prabipyakurel]

all
of
that
in
the
morning
[sskarz]
but

[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh

them
[prabipyakurel]

1
/

of
my
water
this
morning

good
[sskarz]

ur
bottle
[prabipyakurel]
I

out
of
either
the
blue
small
one
or
the
violet
one
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh

the
big
gallon
one
?
[prabipyakurel]
sometimes
,
if
the
other
ones
arent
filled
I
usually
fill
the
other
ones
when
I
am
going
out
[sskarz]
make
ur
goal
like
to
finish
one
of
the
bottles
filled
with
water
per
day
that
'
s
still
less
than
recommended
,
but
it
should
help
you
like
get
used
to
drinking
more
water
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
trying
,
I
used
to
come
back
home
from
school
with
like
half
the
water
still
remaining
sometimes
Yea

drinking
more
for

my
house
and

taking
you
outside

outside
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

on
a
drive
together
or

or

down
the
street
there

taco
truck
near

[prabipyakurel]
that
sounds
so
amazing
[sskarz]
i
just
want
you
right
now
😭
[prabipyakurel]
I
literally
wish
you
were
like
in
a
room
down
the
hall
or
something
now
[sskarz]
same
it
would
be
so
nice
[prabipyakurel]
this
long
distance
thing
damn
[sskarz]
hahaha
its
hard
for
sure
,
my
heart
aches
to
be
with
you
physically
❤
️
but
its
okay
[prabipyakurel]
but
we
will
have
our
time
to
stare
at
the
stars
,
go
on
drives
,
walks
.
[sskarz]
oh
the
best
things
i
'
m
so
looking
forward
to
those
things
[prabipyakurel]
I
pass
out
when
I
go
on
car
rides
every
easily
,
just
putting
that
out
there
[sskarz]
haha
me
too
:)
[prabipyakurel]
like
it
can
be
a
5
minute
drive
,
and
I
will
be
asleep
[sskarz]
maybe
we
can
go
on
a
bit
of
a
road
trip
to
death
valley
and
look
at
the
stars
there
,
they
are
super
visible
during
the
night
and
its
so
pretty
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
sounds
nice
and
just
open
the
sunroof
,
(
dont
know
if
tesla
has
that
)
and
just
recline
the
seats
back
and
you
know
,
talk
.
[sskarz]
tesla
has
a
sunroof
but
you
can
'
t
open
it
,
so
we
can
climb
on
top
of
the
car
together
and
look
from
there
:)
❤
️
i
'
d
love
to
just
gaze
the
stars
and
be
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
we
are
gonna
do
that
dw
[sskarz]
i
would
love
to
:)
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
not
death
valley
but
somewhere
[sskarz]
somewhere
where
pollution
hasn
'
t
touched
the
beautiful
view
of
the
stars
[prabipyakurel]
there
you
go
[sskarz]
maybe
one
day
when
we
are
together
everyday
we
can
take
a
trip
to
alaska
for
a
weekend
and
watch
the
northern
lights
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwwww
[sskarz]
its
one
of
my
dreams
to
do
that
,
and
i
would
love
to
do
that
with
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
actually
really
beautiful
no
I
wanna
see
it
too
and
i
would
love
to
do
that
with
you
❤
️
[sskarz]
we
will
have
our
time
its
just
like
,
ugh
i
wish
i
knew
when
we
could
be
together
everyday
probably
years
from
now
haha
[prabipyakurel]
for
real
,
i
am
always
like
,
but
when
yea
many
years
later
[sskarz]
that
'
s
wild
to
think
about
[prabipyakurel]
it
really
is
you
know
but
hey
,
i
see
you
in
my
future
so
it
will
be
the
best
❤
️
[sskarz]
you
are
a
big
part
of
my
future
now
,
i
know
it
'
s
gonna
be
amazing
to
be
with
you
:)
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
love
,
I
know
it
😉
❤
️
yea
a
time
where
we
can
go
on
vacation
together
is
either
gonna
be
when
everyone
knows
,
or
by
coincidence
,
we
have
to
go
to
the
same
place
for
something
.
[sskarz]
we
'
ll
figure
it
out
I
'
m
sure
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
certain
.
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
just
checked
the
distance
from
san
diego
to
san
francsico
to
check
if
it
was
any
closer
😂
[prabipyakurel]
san
diego
is
way
further
down
[sskarz]
i
'
m
most
likely
going
there
for
a
weekend
for
a
conference
[prabipyakurel]
its
further
than
LA
to
here
[sskarz]
yeah
just
had
to
recheck
my
geography
lol
i
wish
there
was
some
kind
of
important
STEM
conference
in
san
fran
so
i
had
an
excuse
to
go
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
when
you
are
at
San
diego
,
do
your
confrence
,
do
not
take
the
longest
detour
[sskarz]
by
the
time
i
get
to
you
,
i
'
d
miss
the
entire
conference
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
you
will
have
an
opportunity
,
who
knows
yea
and
thats
why
it
would
be
stupid
to
do
anything
like
that
no
worries
tho
,
if
you
are
on
a
long
drive
,
you
can
call
me
,
I
will
just
rant
on
and
on
and
you
wont
be
lonely
❤
️
unless
you
are
going
with
somebody
,
then
its
a
no
[sskarz]
if
u
can
'
t
come
here
by
december
,
then
im
just
going
to
make
some
shit
up
to
come
to
you
😂
[prabipyakurel]
you
would
not
[sskarz]
watch
me
love
when
i
want
something
,
i
'
ll
do
anything
to
get
it
and
i
want
you
[prabipyakurel]
sanskar
,
do
not
do
anything
dumb
no
one
is
gonna
believe
that
there
is
a
conference
during
christmas
[sskarz]
dw
i
'
ll
think
it
all
out
im
not
saying
its
necessarily
going
to
be
a
conference
,
could
be
anything
yk
i
do
have
some
family
up
there
too
,
and
they
'
ve
invited
me
to
come
so
maybe
maybe
,
we
'
ll
just
have
to
wait
and
see
[prabipyakurel]
watch
your
entire
family
be
like
"
lets
all
go
"
that
would
be
quite
interesting
no
?
[sskarz]
hahaha
if
i
can
just
get
there
,
i
'
m
just
that
much
closer
to
being
with
you
even
if
family
tags
along
i
'
ll
find
a
way
[prabipyakurel]
awww
ik
ik
yea
but
like
i
said
,
you
will
probably
see
me
sometime
during
christmas
somewhere
[sskarz]
i
'
m
seeing
you
on
a
date
during
christmas
time
,
i
swear
by
this
we
'
ll
make
it
work
[prabipyakurel]
what
will
i
tell
my
family
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
you
problem
:)
hahaha
jk
jk
idk
,
just
say
you
'
re
hanging
out
with
some
friends
or
something
yk
,
you
haven
'
t
seen
them
in
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
hmm
thats
a
december
problem
[sskarz]
either
that
or
im
showing
up
to
your
house
,
honking
and
picking
you
up
😂
in
front
of
everyone
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
The
way
my
entire
family
will
think
you
waiting
rob
the
house
💀
with
a
tesla
😂
[sskarz]
dw
they
'
d
have
no
idea
its
me
,
i
have
tinted
windows
😂
[prabipyakurel]
hmm
possibly
[sskarz]
and
you
can
just
be
like
,
oh
yeah
bethany
or
whatever
is
picking
me
up
[prabipyakurel]
it
dont
work
that
way
in
my
house
my
mom
will
walk
me
outside
,
wait
till
i
sit
,
and
see
me
go
like
she
did
that
everytime
we
went
to
school
and
she
knows
I
go
with
my
dad
every
morning
[sskarz]
hmmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
she
will
introduce
herself
to
you
you
dont
see
how
this
is
gonna
lead
to
a
problem
like
a
phone
call
to
parents
yours
[sskarz]
yes
yes
i
see
i
see
ok
ok
how
about
you
meet
me
at
the
place
then
?
like
someone
dropped
you
off
and
we
met
there
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
the
only
way
we
can
make
this
work
is
if
there
is
an
event
at
either
your
house
or
mines
your
know
your
way
around
your
family
and
know
how
to
slightly
fool
mine
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
that
can
work
too
no
it
wont
[sskarz]
that
'
s
hard
,
i
can
'
t
just
disappear
from
an
event
at
my
place
[prabipyakurel]
they
gonna
wait

,
then
he
'
s
snitching
haha
[prabipyakurel]

i
will
just
put
it
in
his
mind
that
we
should
all
hang
out
[sskarz]

my
parents
and

somewhere
I
dont

of
the
garage
,
one
in
the
backyard
,
and
they
want
one
more
for
the
side
with
mailbox
[sskarz]
unless
i
literally
hack
into
your
home
security
system
and
turn
the
cameras
off
which
i
could
do
but
[prabipyakurel]

of
trouble
for
that
[prabipyakurel]

a
lot
of
trouble

about
that
[sskarz]
yeah
legal
trouble
at
worst
lol

'
s

be
a
better
way
[prabipyakurel]
do
not
ever
try
that
[sskarz]
i
won
'
t
love
haha
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
there
has
got
to
be
a
better
way
[sskarz]
what
if
we
went
to
an
amusement
park
,
and
instead
of
meeting
outside
the
line
,
we
meet
inside
?
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
that
might
work
[sskarz]
i
'
m
gonna
write
that
down
as
potential
haha
[prabipyakurel]
potential
[sskarz]
if
we
could
do
that
what
amusement
park
would
you
want
to
go
to
?
[prabipyakurel]
uh
[sskarz]
something
with
lots
of
roller
coasters
,
or
more
relax
like
universal
[prabipyakurel]
universal
is
nice
someone
will
tag
along
,
i
cannot
come
alone
there
[sskarz]
damn
,
even
if
you
told
your
parents
that
your
"
friend
group
"
already
went
inside
?
[prabipyakurel]
they
will
take
me
inside
you
dont
even
know
[sskarz]
omg
😂
[prabipyakurel]
"
so
where
is
your
friend
"
[sskarz]
its
like
iron
defense
god
damn
[prabipyakurel]
"
dont
even
wait
for
you
:"
"
what
if
someone
kidnaps
you
"
"
no
,
I
will
meet
someone
and
leave
you
"
"
not
alone
"
they
will
just
...
[sskarz]
they
'
ve
said
all
of
that
before
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[sskarz]
wow
this
is
much
harder
than
i
anticipated
lol
[prabipyakurel]
it
is
especially
with
me
lol
my
parents
are
like
strict
strict
[sskarz]
ok
but
how
about
this
,
ballsy
play
here
but
what
if
i
was
the
one
that
met
up
with
your
parents
?
but
yk
,
we
'
re
just
friends
and
all
because
they
know
me
,
and
they
might
just
think
we
'
d
be
hanging
out
[prabipyakurel]
wait
like
we
told
them
you
randomly
will
be
going
to
the
same
place
?
[sskarz]
yeah
so
like
if
you
were
heading
to
a
park
,
like
just
say
i
invited
you
would
they
be
suspicious
?
[prabipyakurel]
so
here
is
the
thing
,
you
would
have
to
act
like
you
want
to
go
somewhere
where
my
parents
wont
and
then
you
gotta
bring
it
up
at
random
and
be
like
,
"
maybe
prabi
wants
to
go
.
and
then
ask
me
if
i
like
roller
coasters
and
stuff
possibly
they
will
say
yea
she
is
also
crazy
and
we
are
not
going
with
her
[sskarz]
wait
like
ask
you
over
text
and
then
u
show
them
the
texts
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
not
texts
this
has
to
happen
when
we
actually
meet
once
and
then
from
that
point
forward
,
they
wont
really
question
if
i
go
out
with
you
i
assume
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhh
so
if
we
were
at
an
event
[prabipyakurel]
yeaaaaaaa
[sskarz]
and
i
bring
that
up
to
you
and
your
parents
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
just
randomly
when
we
all
sitting
[sskarz]
hm
here
'
s
a
potential
problem
what
if
your
brother
happens
to
be
in
this
conversation
😂
[prabipyakurel]
exactly
there
you
go
,
that
kid
will
just
follow
everywhere
unless
he
has
school
[sskarz]
damn
tell
him
to
shove
off
for
just
a
day
,
i
just
want
you
😂
jk
jk
jk
that
'
s
mean
[prabipyakurel]
lol
no
he
will
be
like
sanskar
is
going
,
great
I
am
coming
too
trust
me
I
had
a
conversation
with
him
and
he
started
off
by
saying
"
there
is
something
about
sanskar
dada
,
i
talked
to
him
about
his
discord
status
and
he
is
just
awesome
"
I
had
to
pretend
like
I
had
not
seen
your
status
for
a
second
[sskarz]
💀
lets
take
your
brother
as
a
third
wheel
😂
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
be
the
third
wheel
there
trust
me
[sskarz]
hahaha
omg
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
he
will
be
like
"
you
wanna
leave
us
alone
for
a
bit
"
😂
[sskarz]
that
would
be
hilarioussssssss
damn
this
is
so
hard
because
not
only
are
your
parents
strict
,
but
wherever
you
go
,
your
brother
is
there
too
haha
[prabipyakurel]
😂
imma
be
the
dog
💀
exactly
and
if
you
drive
,
that
kid
will
sit
in
the
front
i
guarantee
it
[sskarz]
so
there
are
2
criteria
here
:
1
.
Your
parents
need
to
be
okay
with
you
being
somewhere
knowing
or
without
knowing
that
I
'
m
there
,
whatever
suits
that
condition
better
2
.
Your
brother
must
be
isolated
from
the
plan
of
you
and
I
meeting
[prabipyakurel]
there
you
go
Pinned
a
message
.
[sskarz]
well
be
glad
you
'
re
dating
a
CS
major
my
whole
thing
is
to
solve
problems
😂
I
'
ll
solve
this
over
time
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
a
you
problem
buddy
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
think
about
it
every
morning
and
keep
it
in
my
mind
[prabipyakurel]
take
your
time
you
got
3
months
,
give
or
take
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
if
I
end
up
coming
[sskarz]
and
if
you
don
'
t
I
am
[prabipyakurel]
you
stay
home
and
eat
socks
for
christmas
buddy
[sskarz]
NO
!
I
'
m
coming
:)
I
love
uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
and
by
god
damn
it
I
'
m
coming
to
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
but

not
,
if
by
any
chance
i
dont
come
home
for
winter
break
,
we
will
video
call
and
just
voice
call
,
you
are
not
gonna
just
spend
causal
7
HOURS
to
see
me
and
go
back
.
[sskarz]
who
said
i
'
m
driving
:)
i
can
afford
multiple
plane
tickets
,
dont
you
even
worry
about
me
driving
😂
[prabipyakurel]
i
forgot
about
that
[sskarz]
that

s
not

barrier
[prabipyakurel]

me
try
this
again
but

,
if
by
any
chance
i
dont
come
home
for
winter
break
,
we
will
video

call
,
you
are
not
gonna
just

7
HOURS
to
see
me

go
back
or

your
money
that
you
worked
hard
for
on
a
30

don
'
t

what
it
costs
to

it
any
amount
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
know
you
do
,
but
sanskar
,
we
will
see
each
other
and
unless
you
got
a
reason
other
than
me
,
do
not
.
[sskarz]
actually
pause
,
I
think
I
do
but
my
dad
just
takes
it
from
my
account
😂
you
'
re
all
the
reason
I
need
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
If
anything
and
you
cant
resist
it
if
I
dont
,
come
see
your
family
here
okay
not
just
me
[sskarz]
so

I
showed
up
to
your
dorm

wouldn
'
t
let
me
come

literally
wander
the
entire
campus
,
and
match
your
dorm
location
based
off
the
images
and
videos
you
'
ve
sent
me
😂

is
something
I

I
will
get

that
in
a
loving
way

that
in
a
cute
way

be
wandering

a
good
amount
of
time

way
if

its
ironic
[prabipyakurel]
AND
THAT
DOESNT
MEAN
LEAVE
HOME
AND
COME
WHEN
YOU
WANT
[sskarz]
but
its
safer
to
meet
over
there
than
here
😂
DAMN
IT
[prabipyakurel]

something
to
do
,
that
is
way
safer
,
ngl
,
i
can
hold
hands
with
you
here
❤
️
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
here
'
s
another
option
what
if
you
come
here
,
and
we
'
ll
try
to
figure
something
out
,
but
once
you
go
back
and
we
didn
'
t
figure
anything
out
,
i
can
just
head
over
to
you
right
after
ah

that
doesn
'
t
work
that
'
s
instant
red
flags
for
my
family
,
they
'
d
be
like
,
u
going
to
san
fran
the
same
time
as
prabi
?
🤔
tho
they
might
celebrate
and
pay
for
my
ticket
rather
than
restricting
me
😂
omg
u
have
no
idea
,
they
all
think
i
need
to
find
a
nice
gf
right
now
or
its
over
💀
so
hey
,
maybe
maybe
[prabipyakurel]

really
after
you
in
the
good
way
fr
it
will
[sskarz]
yeah
lol
potential
green
flags
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
unless
they
dont
know
when
i
am
going
back
[sskarz]
true
but
i
mean
they
'
re
gonna
ask
u
at
some
function
probably
[prabipyakurel]
if
anything
my
parents
and
your
parents
talk
sometimes
,
my
dad
goes
to
the
sunday
classes
sometimes
they
will
know
[sskarz]
yeah
eh
your
dad
doesn
'
t
come
to
my
dad
'
s
class
that
often
anymore
its
like
once
or
twice
a
year
[prabipyakurel]
yea
lol
now
he
is
like
,
meh
online
,
i
will
just
watch
and
help
from
a
distance
[sskarz]
ah

i
see
[prabipyakurel]

you
used
to
see
him
there
often
?
[sskarz]
not
really
[prabipyakurel]
yea
no
he
doesnt
go
anymore
too
much
[sskarz]
the
times
i
see
him
are
usually
when
he
wants
to
give
some
motivational
speech
when
my
dad
asks
him
to
[prabipyakurel]
no
sometimes
he
be
like
"
i
got
to
go
give
a
speech
"
and
I
am
like
oh
ok
he
just
leaves
scratching
his
head
[sskarz]
lol
yeah
my
dad
hosts
them
routinely
across
the
semester
to
keep
the
students
motivated
the
class
is
hard
and
people
need
a
reminder
as
to
why
they
work
so
hard
yk
👍
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
and
your
dad
is
literally
like
you
,
or
the
other
way
around
actually
,
both
very
hardworking
and
motivational
[sskarz]
he
'
s
my
biggest
rolemodel
after
all
:)
i
learned
all
of
my
skills
from
him
most
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
I
wonder
if
i
search
up
your
name
on
youtube
[sskarz]
and
someday
i
'
m
probably
going
to
take
control
of
his
class
and
so
i
'
ve
been
preparing
for
that
day
like
a
successor
[prabipyakurel]
he
will
probably
had
that
over
to
you
though
yea
like
that
[sskarz]
no
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
"
sanskar

is
a
you

Hey

My

was
normal
,
I
went
to
office
hours
for
math
and
I
loved
the
math
we
did
today
because
we
started
out
first
chapter
today

notes
look
so
nice
.

hour

my
classes

was
super
engaged

I
should
really

taking
more
mid
day
naps

message

Hey

,
good
morning
,
did
you
sleep
well
?
[sskarz]
Hey
love
good
morning
!
I
slept
well
,
hbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
nice
nice
,
I
had
kind
of
a
weird
night
[sskarz]
What
happened
?
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
had
like
5
dreams
,
all
of
which
were
kind
of
really
weird
um
the
first
one
was
about
this
family
where
apparently
a
little
boy
got
run
over
by
a
car
and
I
woke
up
right
after
but
it
felt
real
and
then
I
had
a
dream
that
I
almost
got
hit
by
a
car
but
got
yelled
at
for
standing
in
the
way
yea
after
those
2
,
I
couldnt
really
sleep
,
it
was
around
3
-
4
I
got
really
scared
for
a
while
,
and
watched
insta
for
a
few
minutes
to
calm
myself
down
Yea
I
fell
asleep
for
a
little
more
around
6
and
got
up
around
7
:
30
[sskarz]
Oh
wow
,
that
sounds
terrifying
Are
you
sure
you
got
enough
sleep
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
slept
well
dw
I
am
fine
,
I
feel
good
right
now
but
like
at
night
,
I
knew
it
was
a
dream
and
I
was
scared
to
like
even
get
down
from
my
bed
and
walk
around
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
love
just
don
’
t
worry
about
all
that
stuff
,
it
’
s
just
a
dream
❤
️
At
least
you
got
good
sleep
still
,
but
I
won
’
t
lie
that
is
pretty
weird
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
is
,
I
didnt
even
know
the
boy
that
got
run
over
but
like
it
was
like
a
movie
scene
and
the
kid
broke
his
leg
and
I
just
woke
up
it
was
sad
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
that
sounds
really
sad
At
least
it
’
s
only
a
dream
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
am
glad
[sskarz]
I
had
a
weird
dream
as
well
Apparently
I
was
talking
to
a
therapist
and
explaining
what
was
going
on
with
someone
’
s
death
,
but
I
had
no
idea
who
I
was
talking
about
.
And
the
therapist
was
just
nodding
their
head
,
and
then
I
realized
wtf
was
going
on
and
then
I
woke
up
[prabipyakurel]
damn
you
didnt
know
who
you
were
talking
about
?
[sskarz]
No
idea
I
’
ve
never
had
a
therapist
[prabipyakurel]
oh
[sskarz]
Yeah
[prabipyakurel]
thats
different
and
weird
did
you
know
who
the
therapist
was
or
look
like
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
we
both
got
very
weird
dreams
They
had
like
the
doctor
coat
on
so
a
professional
I
couldn
’
t
tell
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
fr
ahh
i
see
,
but
its
okay
,
it
was
just
one
of
those
dreams
as
long
as
you
didnt
know
whos
death
you
were
talking
about
you
are
fine
you
could
have
been
talking
about
the
death
of
those
bees
bear
ate
a
while
back
😂
[sskarz]
Yeah
just
a
weird
dream
that
is
all
Yeah
the
poor
bees
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
The
moment
you
said
death
,
im
like
omg
them
bees
[sskarz]
It
’
s
always
someone
dying
in
my
dreams
,
either
it
’
s
me
or
someone
else
every
time
lol
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
have
those
too
,
I
remember
I
had
a
dream
that
I
feel
off
a
bridge
because
I
was
looking
down
too
much
and
when
I
got
shot
and
woke
up
drowned
and
got
up
many
things
[sskarz]
Yeah
sounds
about
right
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
never
be
you
love
,
its
a
dream
,
you
are
okay
.

[prabipyakurel]
My
day
was
kinda
fast
,
honestly
the
first
2
classes
were
simple
,
got
help
on
timeline
project
in
office
hours
a
bit
more
,
instead
of
going
to
English
office
hours
I
went
to
a
zoom
office
hours
for
math
and
it
was
helpful
.
I
ended
the
day
with
my
history
class
which
was
just
normal
as
always
.
Had
a
sandwich
for
dinner
and
now
I
am
just
sitting
.
Oh

’
s
pretty
cool
.

[sskarz]
I
can
get
my
work
done
unlike
the
library
which
is
always
so
loud
and
hard
to
do
work
in
[prabipyakurel]
That
seems
nice
,
is
the
weather
pretty
hot
over
in
LA
?
[sskarz]
yeah
it
kinda
is
,
so
that
AC
is
a
blessing
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Why
is
the
library
loud
,
that
’
s
odd
,
I
told
you
right
I
went
into
the
library
here
and
me
walking
was
the
loudest
thing
in
there
Ahh
no
it
’
s
probably
hot
over
there
anyway

I
mean
YOU

The

?
🤔
[sskarz]

this
weekend
I
would
just
be
closer
to
you
[sskarz]
i
would
steal
you
somehow
away
from
everyone
i
'
ll
go
AWOL
just
to
be
with
you
for
a
day
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
hypothetically
if
I
did
come
home
this
weekend
,
and
would
leave
Monday
,
how
would
you
get
me
out
of
my
house
?
[sskarz]
u
run
outside
,
get
in
my
car
,
and
we
speed
off
😂
screw
the
logistics
im
taking
u
[prabipyakurel]
Imagine
I
did
that
Lol
my
parents
would
think
I
got
kidnapped
[sskarz]
eh
who
cares
,
im
not
gonna
be
thinking
about
that
anymore
😂
just
gonna
focus
on
you
,
and
im
taking
you
somewhere
we
can
both
be
alone
for
a
while
,
maybe
just
sit
down
on
a
park
and
we
can
talk
and
hug
and
be
together
honestly
my
heart
just
wants
to
do
the
most
irrational
things
just
to
get
to
you
❤
️
if
i
didn
'
t
have
a
brain
,
i
'
d
be
doing
anything
to
get
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
do
,
hopefully
,
so
do
not
do
anything
dumb
.
Especially
if
it
will
cost
both
you
and
me
a
lecture
form
parents
.
Dammit
now
I
want
to
run
off
somewhere
with
you
alone
❤
️
And
omg
[sskarz]

wanting
to
do
that
for
a
while
haha
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
a
brain
?
Quite
shocking
[sskarz]
eh
they
'
d
probably
praise
me
for
getting
you
as
mine
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
jk
jk
[sskarz]
yeah
sometimes
it
does
work
surprisingly
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww

no
yours
would
also
be
a
lecture
then
a
praise
We
will
have
a
day
where
I
can
just

off
with
you
and
you
drive
to
wherever
you
want
to
take
me
.

that
hell
,
no
other
couple
in
general
is
ever
topping
us
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
one
,
I
know
it
already
[sskarz]
just
to
put
on
a
little
ego
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Nepali
people
fr
gonna
be
like
“
damn
,
never
saw
that
coming
”
[sskarz]
who
knew
,
the
smartest
nepali
kids
would
fall
in
love
❤
️
not
to
toot
our
own
horns
:)
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
absolutely
right
,
and
it
’
s
great
Just
the
best
love
story
out
there
❤
️
Now
that
I
think
about
it
,
idk
if
there
are
any
Nepali
people
that
we
know
that
are
dating
another
Nepali
person
.
Or
is
it
just
me
[sskarz]
actually
that
'
s
true
wow
I
never
thought
about
it
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
just
thought
about
it
too
[sskarz]
nothing
is
coming
to
mind
,
not
a
single
nepali
person
i
know
is
dating
a
nepali
person
mind
blown
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
maybe
they
have
dated
or
are
dating
non
Nepali
people
but
I
can
’
t
think
of
any
either
[sskarz]
you
know
,
let
me
tell
you
something
i
'
m
so
glad
i
'
m
with
you
because
our
cultures
match
because
let
me
tell
you
,
dating
someone
of
a
different
culture
,
is
so
wack
with
you
,
we
both
know
how
to
speak
and
do
nepali
things
,
and
it
is
just
so
much
better
this
way
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
don
’
t
even
know
,
a
few
years
before
I
met
you
I
am
like
there
is
really
no
perfect
Nepali
boy
here
for
me
and
I
thought
it
would
be
really
hard
to
find
anyone
,
lol
who
knew
you
and
me
were
waiting
to
happen
.
I
am
so
happy
that
I
am
dating
a
Nepali
person
,
it
hits
different
when
you
can
talk
shit
about
someone
in
a
different
language
and
eat
amazing
Nepali
food
without
being
like
“
you
like
it
”.
I
can
’
t
even
imagine
dating
someone
that
isn
’
t
Nepali
tbh
,
just
never
been
on
my
mind
.
❤
️
And
hell
our
families
know
each
other
really
well
too
,
just
a
bonus
.
[sskarz]
no
seriously
,
it
just
makes
things
so
much
more
enjoyable
and
relatable
,
and
our
families
aren
'
t
an
issue
at
all
really
I
just
feel
so
safe
and
secure
with
our
relationship
together
yk
?
and
that
'
s
something
I
never
knew
before
hand
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
locked
in
place
🔒
❤
️
Forever
[sskarz]
and
ever
❤
️
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
,
now
you
know
😉
❤
️
It
’
s
one
of
the
reason
I
wanted
to
wait
to
find
the
right
one
and
not
end
up
dating
some
white
dude
because
for
me
I
always
knew
something
would
not
work
out
.
[sskarz]
yeah
don
'
t
look
at
anyone
else
ever
,
only
me
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
only
got
eyes
for
you
love
❤
️
You
too
,
I
will
literally
follow
a
girl
to
her
house
and
have
a
personal
3
hour
lecture
with
her
why
she
should
keep
her
eyes
off
you
.
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
no
I
don
'
t
want
anyone
else
other
than
you
❤
️
you
'
re
perfect
for
me
,
why
would
I
EVER
even
CONSIDER
LOOKING
at
another
girl
you
'
re
MINE
and
I
'
d
have
it
no
other
way
😤
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
my
guy
🥰
And
you
are
mine
❤
️
[sskarz]
yay
:)
❤
️

[prabipyakurel]
We

many
good
moments
and
times

of
us

so
many
good
moments
already

Ahhh
I
love

[sskarz]
it
'
ll
only
get
better
from
here
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
No
but
I
am
not
joking
When
I
first
started
talking
to
you
I
am
like
nah
he
deserves
someone
way
better
and
smarter
But
now
,
nah
it
is
me
and
will
remain
me
forever
🥰
😎
[sskarz]
you
are
that
someone
,
that
'
s
way
better
and
smarter
❤
️
i
have
who
i
deserve
someone
incredible
trust
me
,
you
are
that
someone
for
me
and
i
got
what
i
want
:)
[prabipyakurel]
You
did
,
both
of
us
did
actually
.
It
’
s
amazing
that
we
got
this
far
.
Now
that
I
reread
some
old
texts
from
you
,
you
have
been
giving
some
decent
hints
that
I
simple
just
looked
at
smiled
and
moved
on
.
😭
[sskarz]
AHHHHHHHHHHH
I
TOLD
YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Like
there
are
some
texts
that
I
read
back
to
prior
to
when
you
confessed
and
I
am
like
,
damn
this
fool
liked
me
all
along
You
called
me
a
treasure
,
a
ray
of
sunshine
and
all
those
things
and
I
replied
with
thank
you
😂
😤
Omg
I
was
fr
so
blind
[sskarz]
like
bruh
i
called
you
A
TREASURE
my
treasure
now
but
STILLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
and
this
girl
didn
'
t
bat
an
eye
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
for
so
long
,
after
seeing
my
friends
and
their
love
life
,
I
was
just
used
to
giving
advice
to
people
who
liked
others
,
lol
this
was
the
first
time
so
I
was
just
like
meh
But
now
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
And
I
said
,
that
’
s
what
friends
are
for
,
just
so
you
didn
’
t
think
I
was
weird
or
anything
😵
Was
that
you
when
I
replied
with
a
thank
you
!
[sskarz]
you
called
me
a
friend
and
i
was
dead
asf
💀
i
was
like
,
its
overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
but
i
kept
going
JUST
IN
CASE
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
I
am
so
glad
you
did
It
took
time
for
me
Trust
me
on
that
[sskarz]
yep
😂
hahaha
i
know
i
know
its
your
first
time
i
get
it
hard
to
see
these
things
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
I
am
telling
you
honestly
when
I
was
texting
you
like
even
for
the
first
3
weeks
or
so
,
I
was
like
flying
in
the
air
,
I
also
got
really
scared
that
after
college
started
we
would
stop
talking
because
you
would
have
your
own
thing
and
I
would
have
my
own
,
but
boy
am
I
happy
with
the
way
things
turned
out
.
❤
️
“
well
hey
,
I
'
m
gonna
head
to
bed
pretty
soon
now
,
but
I
do
want
to
say
one
thing
.
We
'
ve
been
talking
everyday
for
like
3
weeks
now
,
and
I
just
wanna
say
I
have
looked
forward
to
talking
with
you
since
then
:).
Hope
you
have
a
good
night
and
sleep
well
!

😴”
-
you

when
you

this
,
i
kept
reading
it
over
like
20
times
,
I
’
m
like
so
do
you
like
me
or

😂
[sskarz]
i
was
really
shooting
my
shot
there
😭
and
I
was
worried
that
maybe
you
'
d
get
bored
or
something
,
so
I
wanted
to
say
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
never
Lol
and
like
an
idiot
I
replied
by
saying
,
yea
dude
it
’
s
nice
talk
to
you
too
,
anyway
gn
lol
But
when
you
said
that
to
me
,
I
was
like
he
is
either
gonna
be
my
boyfriend
or
he
is
gonna
be
another
one
of
my
best
friends
in
life
And
I
got
both
,
that
is
rare
[sskarz]
boyfriend
and
best
friend
:)
you
have
no
idea
,
i
looked
at
that
and
went
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
but
no
that
was
the
first
sign
I
picked
up
on
for
a
while
and
forgot
about
it
eventually
😭
[sskarz]
so
there
was
no
way
of
you
knowing
without
me
saying
it
or
that
dumb
poem
lmao
what
a
love
story
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
I
would
have
chickened
out
and
didn
’
t
wanna
loose
you
as
a
friend
either
So
I
’
m
like
we
gonna
keep
going
until
he
tells
me
he
has
some
girl
and
I
am
just
his
friend
or
he
tells
me
he
likes
me
[sskarz]
i
wanted
you
as
my
girl
for
so
long
haha
❤
️
i
just
didn
'
t
want
to
potentially
lose
you
as
a
friend
either
i
'
d
rather
have
you
as
my
friend
then
having
to
choose
to
ignore
you
at
every
function
yk
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
imagine
I
confessed
and
you
were
like
“
I
am
sorry
”
oh

is
the
last
time
you
see
me
for
this
lifetime
But
here
we
are

Pretty

;)
[prabipyakurel]
Trust

like
a
big
bite
out
of
a
chocolate
bar
or
a
good
that
’
s
mine
and
finish
half
of
it
in
a
single
bite
[sskarz]
so

problems
😂

[prabipyakurel]
You

,
I
will
offer
a
bit
That
means
a
generous
amount
[sskarz]
that
sounds
exactly

[prabipyakurel]
Do

Good

a
sticker
or
a
lollipop
or
something
?
[sskarz]
i
want
ur
embrace
😭
❤
️
but
a
sticker
would
be
pretty
good
too
😂
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
We
’
re
you
one
of
those
kids
that
needed
a
sticker
after
you
got
a
shot
from
the
doctors
[sskarz]
nah
i
usually
got
like
a
jolly
rancher
[prabipyakurel]
You
cried
?
[sskarz]
idk
,
but
usually
no
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
[sskarz]
they
just
gave
out
free
candy
to
kids
after
the
appointment
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
no
I
took
those
too
[sskarz]
speaking
of
grown
adults
that
had
professions
giving
kids
something
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
scared
of
needles
?
[sskarz]
i
remember
a
time
that
i
took
a
trip
to
hawaii
,
got
my
scar
accident
,
and
the
way
back
to
california
,
the
pilot
gave
me
his
metal
pin
on
his
suit
that
basically
signifies
that
you
'
re
a
pilot
one
time
idk
where
that
metal
pin
is
now
,
but
it
was
pretty
cool
nah
are
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
but
that
’
s
so
sweet
.
And
you
were
hurt
too
so
…
Nah
,
never
That
is
like
a
Prajjwal
thing
😂
[sskarz]
yeah
he
probably
felt
bad
for
me
i
had
like
a
big
cloth
on
my
face
hiding
the
stitches
😂
oh
can
i
ask
something
?
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
damn
,
hey
but
glad
it
didn
’
t
like
get
to
your
eye
or
something
You
fr
real
clumsy
for
getting
hurt
at
a
water
park
😂
Mhm
[sskarz]
are
you
anemic
?
like
at
all
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
So
I
am
not
,
at
least
I
don
’
t
think
so
,
but
the
last
time
I
went
to
the
doctors
and
it
showed
that
my
blood
level
was
pretty
low
,
I
was
on
iron
pills
for
like
2
months
but
now
I
assume
it
’
s
fine
Last
time
I
checked
it
was
not
the
best
but
it
’
s
at
a
good
level
[sskarz]
oh
okay
no
you
'
re
probably
not
anemic
,
just
was
low
for
a
little
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
’
s
probably
what
it
was
Oh
the
way
my
mom
made
me
drink
water
,
juice
,
and
made
so
much
saag
so
it
would
go
back
up
I
had
beet
root
juice
That
thing
is
like
🤢
[sskarz]
omg
but
that
'
s
good
,
you
probably
avoided
becoming
anemic
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
coffee
and
soda
was
off
limits
for
a
long
time
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
get
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
lol
mom
be
moms
,
I
love
them
Are
you
?
[sskarz]
i
just
ask
if
you
'
re
anemic
because
i
am
and
i
have
a
rare
case
of
anemia
called
thalassemia
its
chronic
and
genetic
,
but
nothing
dangerous
it
just
means
i
have
less
hemoglobin
than
the
average
person
so
i
get
tired
easier
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
yea
take
care
of
yourself
.
I
appreciate
you
sharing
though
.
[sskarz]
oh
and
its
not
like
a
severe
case
at
all
dw
about
that
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
ok
ok
[sskarz]
its
pretty
minor
but
just
something
i
thought
you
should
know
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
my
dads
hemoglobin
level
dropped
and
that
had
problems
so
just
stay
safe
Sanskar
,
take
care
of
yourself
and
don
’
t
take
in
too
much
work
.
Yea
no
thank
you
for
sharing
.
[sskarz]
love
don
'
t
worry
,
i
know
my
limits
well
but
i
appreciate
your
concern
❤
️
also
,
a
completely
unrelated
note
but
another
reason
i
asked
if
two
people
are
anemic
,
they
can
'
t
have
children
not
related
at
all
,
but
just
something
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
okay
nice
to
know
[sskarz]
unfortunately
its
genetic
so
my
kids
will
most
likely
have
it
too
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
’
s
okay
.
But
yea
if
it
’
s
genetic
lol
most
likely
[sskarz]
yep
but
as
long
as
its
not
both
people
,
then
its
fine
👍
very
minor
anywho
[prabipyakurel]
I
never
knew
that
[sskarz]
my
family
has
like
tons
of
history
of
medical
stuff
like
this
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
and
your
sis
is
a
nurse
so
[sskarz]
well
she
can
'
t
treat
my
chronic
disease
😂
but
again
,
its
not
a
big
deal
at
all
like
im
very
okay
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
hey
it
’
s
okay
,
love
you
gonna
be
fine
[sskarz]
yeah
love
,
but
im
just
trying
not
to
get
you
worried
❤
️
im
fine
,
been
fine
for
19
years
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Promise
me
to
keep
yourself
safe
and
healthy
though
.
[sskarz]
i
promise
,
that
'
s
what
im
working
towards
don
'
t
worry
about
me
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
You
do
you
okay
,
keep
yourself
safe
.
👍
Yea
I
think
I
got
my
blood
checked
last
month
for
anything
to
indicate
anemia
and
for
all
I
know
my
dad
went
“
everything
clear
”
So
I
am
assuming
I
don
’
t
have
it
[sskarz]
sounds
great
[prabipyakurel]
Iron
deficiency
yea
[sskarz]
its
also
why
i
have
dark
circles
under
my
eyes
its
just
genetic
came
from
my
mom
looks
like
i
'
m
tired
all
the
time
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
[sskarz]
idk
if
you
noticed
that
,
but
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
did
,
but
you
never
looked
tired
to
me
[sskarz]

'
t
look
tired
in
front
of
my
potential
love
;)
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
No

salt

not
finalized
[sskarz]
i

there
with
you
in
the
kitchen
,
to

[prabipyakurel]
Like

Let

Texting

[sskarz]
I
had
to
look
at
the
tv
above
you

❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
When

Hey

I
am
not
disturbing
you
,
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
hey
love
,
you
'
re
not
disturbing
me
at
all
,
i
was
just
playing
a
game
.
my
day
was
pretty
good
,
boring
but
good
👍
how
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
done
with
your
game
?
Finish
it
first
[sskarz]
yeah
im
just
paused
,
dw
about
me
how
was
your
day
love
?
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
like
a
full
math
day
.
So
I
finished
all
my
sociology
and
English
reading
or
scanning
in
the
morning
,
then
went
to
office
hours
and
worked
on
problems
for
math
for
an
hour
or
so
.
Then
went
to
my
actual
math
lecture
where
I
fell
asleep
and
it
was
funny
because
I
fell
asleep
in
such
a
way
that
the
notebook
on
the
table
fell
on
the
floor
with
the
pencils
and
everything
😂.
And
then
got
back
,
worked
on
quite
a
lot
more
math
problems
that
I
was
weak
on
,
and
just
finished
.
Still
gonna
go
the
same
tomorrow
morning
and
then
I
think
I
got
it
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
damn
you
'
re
such
a
hard
worker
,
that
you
fell
asleep
in
the
actual
lecture
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
love
,
yes
but
I
was
so
tired
I
just
fell
asleep
and
dropped
like
my
note
book
,
pencil
,
pens
everything
The
person
on
the
on
the
other
seat
had
to
help
me
pick
it
up
too
I
was
also
in
the
front
3
rows
[sskarz]
omg
love
😂
make
sure
you
'
re
getting
good
sleep
tonight
okay
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
will
It
was
out
of
boredom
I
was
not
tired
[sskarz]
and
if
you
need
the
caffeine
to
stay
awake
,
you
should
drink
some
coffee
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
one
class
😂
No
yea
I
should
do
that
tho
[sskarz]
no
its
okay
,
just
be
careful
love
❤
️
i
don
'
t
want
you
missing
out
on
important
math
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Whatever

went
over
today
,
that
is
a
monday
office
hour
problem
😂
I

’
t
love
,

❤
️
[sskarz]
i
trust
you
that
you
'
ll

fine
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
thank
you
,
I
will
.
There
was
this
one
Indian
guy
that
came
into
the
office
hours
and
asked
him
,
can
I
still
come
to
the
lecture
even
if
it
’
s
not
my
lecture
,
and
the
professor
went
“
no
I
will
kick
you
out
and
the
guy
took
it
seriously
it
was
hilarious
😂
😂
[sskarz]
wait
are
all
of
your
classes
in
lecture
halls
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
omg
[prabipyakurel]
All
4
[sskarz]
that
'
s
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
All
of
them
have
100
+
students
[sskarz]
jeez
i
haven
'
t
had
a
class
in
a
lecture
hall
yet
just
traditional
classrooms
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
all
These
years
[sskarz]
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
dang
[sskarz]
but
honestly
,
i
like
the
traditional
classrooms
because
its
easier
for
me
to
ask
questions
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
it
seems
easier
to
do
so
It
’
s
like
like
99
others
students
are
watching
you
raise
your
hand
and
stuff
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
that
'
s
crazy
,
can
'
t
wait
to
experience
one
when
i
come
over
there
to
study
:)
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
have
not
had
or
have
had
a
friend
with
a
regular
class
Ahhhhhh
that
would
be
awesome
The
small
classrooms
are
only
an
office
hour
thing
[sskarz]
right
?!
i
'
ve
been
thinking
about
it
a
lot
more
recently
if
I
can
get
in
berkeley
for
a
masters
in
business
that
would
be
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
It
would
be
amazing
,
and
really
cool
,
and
hey
you
got
this
!
❤
️
[sskarz]

definitely
in
consideration
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

it
,

be
here
together

great
bonus

:)
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
you
will
love
,
i
have
no
doubt
in
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
will
try
my
hardest
,
I

to
.
❤
️
Getting

in
college
and
build
a
good
resume
,
and
you
'
ll
be
fine
👍
[prabipyakurel]

:)
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
love
,
you
don
’
t
even
know
for
so
long
,
I
doubted
myself
with
a
lot
of
things
in
life
,
but
now
that
I
reflect
back
,
I
am
like
,
I
had
that
thing
tho
.
Didn
’
t
know
what
I
was
so
scared
of
.
Like
I
am
telling
you
if
more
than
2
good
things
were
happening
to
me
,
I
always
thought
that
there
was
something
bad
waiting
for
me
that
was
waiting
to
happen
.
[sskarz]
that
'
s
something
i
like
to
call
,
"
being
scared
of
ghosts
".
if
there
'
s
nothing
there
to
scare
you
,
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
no
i
totally
get
that
,
i
used
to
think
the
exact
same
way
until
i
realized
that
i
control
the
outcomes
of
things
that
i
care
about
,
and
its
just
been
good
things
after
good
things
,
hasn
'
t
stopped
👍
as
long
as
you
are
focused
on
the
things
you
need
and
want
,
then
you
can
control
how
you
want
things
to
go
most
things
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
now
if
here
is
no
reason
for
me
to
be
scared
,
I
will
just
try
and
go
for
it
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
i
love
you
for
that
!
keep
going
,
and
i
'
ll
always
be
here
to
remind
you
that
you
can
do
the
things
you
want
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
’
t
thank
you
enough
for
that
love
,

ur
day
today
?
i
didn
'

[prabipyakurel]
I
am
using
this
thing
to
talk
to
you
love
,
i
will
not
have
this
thing
downloaded
because
when
i
am
home
,
my
dad
treats
my
computer
as
the
go
to
computer
to
look
for
stuff
and
do
stuff
👍
It
was
nice
,
i
did
a
little
bad
on
the
math
quiz
but
have
been
getting
full
points
for
the
homework
.
Sociology
and
philosophy
wasnt
too
bad
,
I
basically
got
like
an
early
quiz
review
,
like
what
to
expect
and
all
for
both
,
and
history
was
easy
as
always
,
just
note
taking
,
Went
to
buy
cereal
and
cheeseballs
at
walgreens
and
then
roommates
went
home
for
the
weekend
so
just
chilling
alone
How
about
you
?
NO
DONT
EVER
CALL
ME

boo
,
bae
,

else
?
[prabipyakurel]
thats
all
for
now
[sskarz]
wdym
by
little
bad
?

bad
or
just
a
minor
mistake
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
like
I
messed
up
because
I
forgot
a
step
,
and
I
am
honestly
kind
of
scared
about
what
it
will
do
to
my
overall
grades
,
especially
because
the
midterms
are
also
next
week
as
well
.
so
like
bad
bad
[sskarz]
have
you
got
the
score
back
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
but
i
only
got
one
right
out
of
the
3
[sskarz]
o
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
sucks
[sskarz]
damn
,
that
'
s
tough
i
hate
those
quizzes
where
its
just
like
3
questions
or
2
[prabipyakurel]
midterm
is
only
5
45
min
[sskarz]
oh
i
hate
that
u
mess
up
once
and
its
like
catastrophic
[prabipyakurel]
no

I
was
panicking
the
entire
way
back
but
i
have
almost
finished
the
entire
water
bottle
and
have
managed
to
calm
myself
about
it
for
now

weaknesses

just
let
me
go
and
said
,
"

MY
BACK
.

pissed
at
that
TA

i
came
back
home
,
refreshed
and

rude
to
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh

[sskarz]
like
the
last
time
i

a
club
meeting
and
the
guy
said
,
"
so
is
this
gonna
become
a
routine
where

just
leave
lab
?"
and
i
had
to
explain
to
him
that
i
finished
all
the
work
beforehand
and
proved
it
and
then
he
let
me
go
like
he
'
s
such
a
bitch
boy
anyways
[prabipyakurel]
oh

at
a
circle

and
we
were
just

some
really
attractive
guy
at
the
gym
and
im
just
making
fun
of
her
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
[sskarz]
and
then
she
starts
talking
about
my
nonexistant
love
life
that
she
has
no
idea
about
and
then
she
suddenly
goes
,
"
oh
so
do
you
think
Prabi
is
pretty
hm
?"
and
while
everyone
else
was
talking
before
this
,
EVERYONE
at
the
table
DRILLED
THEIR
EYES
ON
ME
like
a
bomb
was
just

and
then
my
sister
asks
,
"

pursue
her
?"
[prabipyakurel]
and

[sskarz]
and
i
was
like
,
"

s
nosy
,
but
he
'
s
a
nice
guy
of

[prabipyakurel]

person
at

[sskarz]
i

💀
[prabipyakurel]

'
s
gonna
be
the
one
trying
to
snoop
into
my
dms
and
find
who
im
talking
to
he
does
that
all
the
time
so
for
our

cousin
[prabipyakurel]

wondering
who

I
made

I

I

too
lazy

did
you
think
I
was
Be
honest
[sskarz]
Hmmmm
Like
17
Y
[prabipyakurel]
Just
curious
[sskarz]
Not
because
u
looked
old
or
anything
,
just
because
u
acted
really
mature
for
ur
age
and
I
was
surprised
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
no
I
did
not
,
I
was
weird
that
entire
night
You
were
just
so
cuteeeeeeeee
and
I
kept
trying
to
look
at
you
[sskarz]
U
were
amazing
and
I
was
like
,
I
’
ve
never
felt
this
way
before
,
was
it
because
of
her
?
And
after
I
confirmed
it
with
2
more
events
,
my
heart
was
set
on
u
from
the
start
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No

just
looking
at
you
smile
that
night

it
was
from
that
moment
where
I
never

’

when
I
can
’
t
be
there

💀
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lmao

the
morning
to
ask
where
like
everything
was
and
all
If
she
said
no
,
would
you

?
[sskarz]
That
’
s

question
Yeah

’
t

[sskarz]
I
’
m
fighting
for
us
My
family
will
fight
with
me
we
will
convince
them
if
they
ever
said
no
[prabipyakurel]
she
will
give
you
the
death
stare
,
she
loves
you
but
she
thinks
i
am
too
young
and
will
say
no
for
now
but
trust
me
,
you
dont
have
to
worry
about
mines
either
[sskarz]
No
obviously
,
I
’
m
not
gonna
say
anything
[prabipyakurel]
yea
just
smile
[sskarz]
You
are
young
and
I
don
’
t
think
we
need
that
kind
of
stress
right
now
[prabipyakurel]
act
like
you
havent
been
talking
to
me
everyday
😂
[sskarz]
Future
problems
for
future
us
[prabipyakurel]
No

But
if
ur
family
did
say
no
in
the
future
Just
know
I
’
m
still
here
with
you
I
won
’
t
let

[prabipyakurel]
No

fighting
for
you

that
,
I

with
you

even
imagine
it
they
will
be
way
more
surprised
first
,
but
they
wont
say
np
[sskarz]
I
know
,
just
keeping
everything
considered
as
plan
B
Well
there
is
no
plan
B
,
it
’
s
just
being
with
u
as
plan
A
I
’
ve
got
no
other
plans
[prabipyakurel]
i
know
and
if
for
any
reason
it
comes
to
that
point
,
I
am
fighting
for
us
❤

[prabipyakurel]
Just
act
casual
and
say
hi
to
her
[sskarz]
No
yeah

[prabipyakurel]
she
will
probably
just
smile
and
be
like
"
okie
,
imma

"
[sskarz]
I
wonder
if
Prajwal
will
be
there
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
at
a
teej
party
,
nope
[sskarz]
Really
?
he
just
doesn
’
t
like
teej
or
what
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
its
just
he
assumes
there
are
only
girls
there
so
when
he
hears
about
it
,
he
is
like
,
what
am
i
gonna
do
there
and
my
mom
goes
at
her
own
time
,
she
is
not
waiting
for
him
[sskarz]
Ohhh

’
s

see
[prabipyakurel]
And
i
think
he
has
football
practice
[sskarz]
Oh

will
probably
he

pretty
late
with
my
dad

there
for
long
Since

up
individually
,
with

without

[prabipyakurel]
Like
it
went
off
rn

put
the

it
asked
me
to
manually
type
in
password

Definition

’
t
keep
u
up
for
way
too
long
last
night
Honestly
,
I
can
’
t
even
remember
when
we
ended
call
,
I
was
like
already
asleep
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
it
’
s
because
I
was
laying
on
my
side
and
recording
,
lol
,
I
am
not
as
tired
dw
,
I
think
at
3
:
15
both
of
us
just
fell
asleep
and
around
3
:
45
I
got
up
to
the
phone
like
near
my
stomatch
and
when
I
picked
it
up
you
were
still
there
.
I
called
your
name
a
few
times
and
think
I
woke
you
back
up
,
sorry
,
and
then
we
said
gn
.
I
loved
it
so
much
,
don
’
t
say
sorry
!
❤

[sskarz]
Oki

long
as
ur
okay

I
’
m

love
you
so
much
❤
️
Last
night

really
nice
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
so
much
,
I
loved
last
night
❤
️
Felt
like
I
was
literally
falling
asleep
next
to
you
I
am
love
,
dw
,
but
hey
did
you
sleep
well
?
[sskarz]
Yeah

,
and
I
felt
so
relaxed
being
with
you
I
did
too
dw
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
felt
really
relaxed
too
😊
❤
️
[sskarz]

m
so
glad
:)
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
don
’
t
remember
ending
the
call
[sskarz]
Haha
no
I
really
don
’
t
I
just
faded
into
sleep
thinking
I
was
with
you
all
night
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
cutie
,
no
I
said
you
name
a
few
times
and
you
got
up
and
when
I
said
good
night
love
,
you
said
gn
and
I
ended
it
lol
[sskarz]
Awww
if
u
never
ended
it
I
wouldn
’
t
even
have
noticed
haha
[prabipyakurel]
So
sweet
,
I
was
there
with
you
;
)
No
yea
we
both
fell
asleep
and
I
just
randomly
got
up
and
saw
it
I
would
have
woke
up
in
the
morning
with
that
thing
on
too
lol
[sskarz]
U
probably
would
’
ve
been
called
by
ur
mom
or
brother
and
the
call
would
’
ve
ended
haha
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
but
it
’
s
Sunday
,
so
I
assume
everyone
is
barely
getting
up
over
there
too
[sskarz]
No
but
seriously
,
I
really
loved
last
night
.
You
are
just
so
incredibly
sweet
and
adorable
[prabipyakurel]
Ages
😂
[sskarz]
Ugh
love
I
’
m
in
bed
with
one
eye
barely
open
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
mean
it
,
last
night
was
an
amazing
way
to
end
my
day
,
your
voice
and
you
are
the
best
.
That
’
s
literally
how
I
recorded
my
message
which
is
why
I
sound
so
dead
,
but
dw
I
am
not
tired
anymore
Are
you
still
feeling
sleepy
?
[sskarz]
Meh
not
really
I
’
m
gonna
have
some
hot
chocolate
coffee
in
the
morning
and
then
go
to
the
gym
later
Oh
and
your
good
night
kisses
were
just
the
best
;)
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
good
,
yea
I
am
going
to
make
myself
coffee
too
,
I
don
’
t
have
sugar
but
oh
well
.
But
hey
take
it
easy
at
the
gym
okay
,
do
as
much
as
you
can
only
.
Wdym
,
yours
were
amazing
.
🥰
❤
️
[sskarz]
Dw
love
,
I
’
m
gonna
bust
my
ass
out
today
and
hit
the
heavy
weights
😂
With
enough
caffeine
I
can
strike
god
down
,
the
gym
ain
’
t
nothing
dw
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
Okie
cutie
,
you
do
you
,
but
still
be
careful
You
don
’
t
wanna
like
accidentally
pull
a
muscle
or
something
[sskarz]
Of
course
mi
amor
❤
️
Always
do
proper
stretching
👍
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
the
one
thing
I
would
probably
mess
up
on
doing
at
the
gym
,
trust
me
I
would
lift
the
weight
the
wrong
way
or
something
It
would
be
pretty
funny
😄
[sskarz]
Haha
it
’
s
okay
tho
,
when
we
’
re
officially
together
I
’
ll
take
u
and
you
’
ll
learn
slowly
and
safely
with
me
It
’
s
really
simple
if
u
have
someone
experienced
with
u
[prabipyakurel]
Dw
,
I
will
go
with
you
and
keep
bothering
you
every
5
min
Then
we
can
order
pizza
and
stuff
and
go
back
home
[sskarz]
Omg
bother
me
everyday
when
we
’
re
together
,
I
love
uuuu
ur
so
cute
[prabipyakurel]
Is
that
how
it
works
or
are
we
not
supposed
to
eat
pizza
and
stuff
after
working
out
😂
[sskarz]
Hahaha
no
no
we
can
sometimes
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
shall
,
imma
be
taking
dumb
pictures
of
you
while
you
lifting
and
stuff
😂
I
will
be
sitting
on
some
machine
with
like
the
weight
at
like
1lb
and
pulling
on
it
[sskarz]
Hahaha
ur
so
adorable
My
little
cutie
patootie
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
’
m
high
school
,
there
were
like
exercising
machines
on
the
second
floor
so
when
we
finished
warmup
we
would
go
up
there
.
And
there
was
this
one
where
you
would
have
to
like
set
the
thing
for
how
heavy
you
want
it
on
both
sides
and
pull
inward
and
I
used
to
put
it
more
than
I
could
do
and
when
I
let
go
,
I
would
launch
myself
somewhere
.
[sskarz]
Haha
that
’
s
pretty
cool
U
guys
had
real
gym
machines
in
high
school
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
there
was
an
actual
gym
also
for
weight
training
and
wrestlers
but
the
one
we
went
to
it
was
like
6
or
7
machines
that
everyone
played
until
the
weight
lifting
class
came
and
then
I
would
just
leave
[sskarz]
Ohhh
I
see
That
’
s
nice
tho
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
I
see
something
similar
to
those
,
I
will
know
how
to
use
some
because
I
I
have
watched
people
use
them
[sskarz]
Yeah
trust
me
,
a
lot
of
machines
in
the
gym
work
very
similarly
together
,
just
gotta
know
what
the
tiny
differences
are
And
I
’
ll
help
u
with
that
dw
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
have
you
,
you
will
teach
me
.
You
will
seriously
be
there
scratching
you
head
giving
me
the
side
eye
I
am
super
clumsy
lol
I
will
find
a
way
to
mess
up
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
love
,
I
’
ll
make
sure
u
get
the
form
down
correctly
It
’
s
why
I
’
m
here
:)
But
hey
,
what
’
s
ur
plans
for
today
[prabipyakurel]
Um
well
I
am
probably
gonna
go
down
and
get
sushi
for
lunch
from
the
store
below
,
that
or
like
ramen
.
And
then
I
am
going
to
continue
studying
,
idk
I
am
kind
of
freaking
out
about
everything
,
and
for
dinner
I
am
probably
going
to
go
to
the
Nepali
store
with
my
friend
and
eat
momo
.
Kind
of
the
same
as
yesterday
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Hey
hey
why
are
you
freaking
out
?
Are
you
really
okay
?
Talk
to
me
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
am
really
scared
about
the
math
thing
Thursday
The
other
ones
I
got
it
,
I
will
be
fine
But
like
,
yk
what
if
I
do
really
bad
on
it
[sskarz]
Don
’
t
think
like
that
,
you
’
re
going
to
step
in
that
lecture
hall
and
you
’
re
going
to
do
your
best
okay
!
I
have
complete
faith
that
you
will
be
fine
,
I
know
the
last
one
might
have
really
scared
you
because
you
didn
’
t
do
so
well
,
but
you
’
ve
been
practicing
a
lot
and
you
even
solved
that
really
difficult
math
problem
too
❤
️
It
’
s
scary
I
know
,
but
you
will
do
well
,
I
just
know
it
!
Believe
in
yourself
for
me
,
okay
?
You
’
ve
worked
really
hard
towards
this
next
math
midterm
and
I
know
you
’
re
going
to
nail
that
thing
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
okie
,
I
got
this
!
I
will
try
my
best
love
,
I
promise
.
Thank
you
,
I
love
you
so
much
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
And
hey
,
if
you
ever
feel
those
doubts
coming
back
,
please
come
tell
me
!
That
’
s
the
one
thing
I
can
help
you
from
here
and
I
want
you
to
be
at
your
best
!
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
just
I
feel
like
I
will
make
a
dumb
mistake
somewhere
And
then
once
I
mess
up
on
one
,
I
will
mess
up
on
the
rest
[sskarz]
I
know
,
it
’
s
a
math
test
and
it
’
s
easy
to
make
a
mistake
with
the
wrong
negative
sign
and
yk
simple
things
like
that
,
but
as
long
as
you
slow
it
down
,
take
your
time
on
each
step
of
the
problem
,
you
will
notice
if
you
made
any
mistakes
❤
️
What
I
like
to
do
at
the
end
of
math
problems
is
try
to
prove
my
own
answer
wrong
,
step
by
step
,
and
if
I
can
’
t
find
a
way
to
prove
it
wrong
,
then
I
know
I
’
m
right
Idk
if
you
’
ve
ever
done
that
,
but
that
’
s
what
really
helped
me
to
avoid
those
small
mistakes
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
no
I
will
try
that
for
sure
Thank
you
love
,
it
means
a
lot
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Hey
,
the
key
factor
to
making
no
mistakes
is
believing
in
yourself
and
your
math
solving
abilities
.
The
more
practice
you
do
,
the
more
confident
you
become
,
and
once
you
’
re
comfortable
with
a
specific
type
of
problem
,
you
can
move
onto
the
next
❤
️
It
’
s
just
this
one
thing
that
I
can
make
a
real
impact
even
being
so
far
from
you
,
I
wanna
make
sure
you
use
me
to
lift
yourself
up
okay
?
I
love
you
and
I
’
m
always
believing
in
you
!
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
,
I
will
go
in
and
do
my
best
on
that
thing
.
And
I
will
continue
practicing
more
and
more
until
I
have
gotten
all
of
them
down
.
❤
️
I
love
you
so
much
!

?
😂
haha
well
i
always
just
hack
it
,
never
needed
to
pay
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
damn
[sskarz]
but
i
know
my
school
pays
for
it
under
my
school
email
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
elac
paid
and
still
PAYS
for
mine
and
i
just
have
it
like
I
use
it
when
i
need
to
work
on
word
or
powerpoint
sometimes
but
other
than
that
idont
really
know
what
else
to
do
one
there
with
the
other
apps
[sskarz]
ay
never
tell
and
maybe
they
'
ll
pay
for
you
for
life
and
if
not
,
then
i
'
ll
hack
it
for
you
another
reason
for
me
to
come
to
you
:)
[prabipyakurel]
awwww
yes
yes
,
i
can
still
access
like
the
elac
canvas
and
everything
they
still
message
me
about
programs
and
I
am
like
,
i
am
out
already
its
a
pretty
boring
this
to
look
at
kinda
useless
at
least
for
me
I
will
not
have
you
come
over
here
just
so
you
can
hack
this
thing
for
me
.
[sskarz]
oh
i
see
but
what
if
i
just
show
up
without
permission
i
like
appear
like
a
ninja
with
smoke
[prabipyakurel]
well
if
you
do
,
im
keeping
you
[sskarz]
your
personal
tech
IT
guy
will
just
appear
you
will
never
have
to
worry
about
tech
problems
again
[prabipyakurel]
never
,
i
know
[sskarz]
yayyyyyyyyyyyyy
i
might
just
forget
about
the
tech
issue
at
that
point
😂
im
jk
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
gonna
be
like
,
nah
that
is
a
later
problem
[sskarz]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
you
know
that
is
pretty
cool
,
in
the
future
,
if
i
ever
have
any
computer
problems
I
dont
even
need
to
call
for
help
,
you
will
literally
be
right
there
[sskarz]
yeah
if
you
really
think
about
it
here
'
s
a
reason
to
stick
to
me
if
you
didn
'
t
love
me
enough
already
:
the
world
is
now
moving
towards
tech
doing
stuff
for
us
and
AI
and
what
not
,
and
that
means
newer
tech
innovations
which
means
that
the
future
generations
of
tech
,
you
'
ll
never
have
to
be
confused
as
I
'
ll
take
care
of
the
research
and
general
knowledge
about
all
tech
involved
:)
so
you
'
ll
never
have
to
worry
about
any
of
the
weird
tech
stuff
that
comes
out
in
the
future
,
and
that
'
s
a
great
positive
point
!
*
im
like
trying
to
sell
myself
to
you
😂
*
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwww
you
never
had
to
,

day

❤
️
[sskarz]

trying
to
explain
why
im

great
boyfriend
[prabipyakurel]
But

the
tech
is
getting
crazier
and
crazier
,
but
good
thing
i

a
boyfriend
that
i
can
just
ask

I

.
I
just
woke
up
after
a
while
and
went
"
sanskar
"
like
3
times
and
then
you
did
a
yawn
and
said
"
yea

"
and
then
i
said
gn
because
you
stopped
talking
it
was
hilarious
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
seriously
can
'
t
remember
it
was
just
my
subconscious
talking
straight
from
the
heart
[prabipyakurel]

sounded
so

"
and

and

t
know

,
I
don
’
t
remember
probably
tapped
by
accident
as
I
was
shuffling
around
[prabipyakurel]
We
both
got
up
the
second
time
and
I
told
you
to
go
back
to
sleep
,
and
then
just
left
it
like
that
[sskarz]
Did
you
get
enough
sleep
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yes

’
s
okay

I
loved
your
voice
Mhm

fresh
[sskarz]
I

hearing
you

[prabipyakurel]
Did

And

up
but
went
back
to
sleep
No

’
s

[prabipyakurel]
I

Oh

Thank

only
supposed

hour
but
time

❤
️
[sskarz]
I
saw
the
hour
cross
but
I
didn
’
t
wanna
stop
,
I
wanted
to
stay
with
u
in
the
call
so
I
didn
’
t
say
anything
about
that
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
yea
no
I
noticed
and
I
was
like
,
are
you
sleepy
?
It
’
s
why
I
kept
on
asking
lol
and
you
said
no
every
time
You
are
so
cute
,
I
loved
staying
in
the
call
with
you
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
really
wasn
’
t
yk
,
I
just
wanted
to
stay
with
you
You
washed
over
me
like
a
warm
breeze
and
made
me
feel
so
cozy
and
warm
No
way
I
was
gonna
leave
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwww
love
,
you
are
so
sweet
❤
️
It
’
s
okay
,
I
will
be
there
when
you
need
me
to
stay
I
loved
it
too
[sskarz]
I
’
m
glad
u
did
too
!
[prabipyakurel]
Your
good
night
kisses
were
amazing
You
were
still
giving
me
them
even
when
I
was
like
whispering
[sskarz]
Haha
I
was
barely
awake
so
I
don
’
t
doubt
I
did
My
heart
does
what
my
heart
wants
to
do
:)
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
did
and
it
was
cute
Then
you
told
me
to
fall
asleep
and
I
think
I
did
I
don
’
t
even
know
when
the
call
ended
[sskarz]
Me
neither
,
I
woke
up
and
the
call
had
already
ended
So
I
thought
u
ended
it
when
I
went
back
to
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
didn
’
t
,
I
fell
asleep
before
I
hit
end
You
were
whispering
something
and
I
just
slept
[sskarz]
Knowing
me
,
I
probably
smacked
my
phone
while
I
was
asleep
and
hit
the
end
call
button
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
but
hey
it
’
s
okay
,
we
fell
asleep
hearing
each
other
and
it
was
amazing
❤
️
[sskarz]
It
was
so
nice
,
like
I
honestly
couldn
’
t
have
asked
for
a
better
night
You
are
just
the
best
person
ever
I
love
you
so
much
!!!
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

And
then
you
did
that
chicken
joke
😭
It
was
hilarious
[sskarz]
Hahaha
I
remember
that
[prabipyakurel]
You
couldn
’
t
even
say
it
without
laughing
[sskarz]
Whenever
I
get
those
kinds
of
questions
,
imma
share
them
with
u
I

I
debate
the
dumbest
shit
in
my

sometimes
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No

’
s
so
funny
.

[prabipyakurel]
Hey
[sskarz]
oh
?
what
'
s
up
?
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
done
this
before
?
[sskarz]
reminds
me
of
piecewise
functions
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
thing
[sskarz]
what
is
the
section
called
?
oh
it
is
?
[prabipyakurel]
Absolute
values
and
piecewise
[sskarz]
from
what
it
looks
like
you
'
re
given
an
x
value
,
that
can
only
be
substituted
into
one
of
the
functions
depending
on
its
range
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
no
shit
,
you
in
class
,
explain
later
Get
back
to
work
love
Sorry
[sskarz]
im
not
!
i
have
class
in
30
dw
i
can
help
!
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
ok
ok
So
would
I
plug
in
all
those
x
values
to
see
which
one
is
a
solution
[sskarz]
yes
you
would
get
a
solution
based
on
what
you
get
for
x
so
u
would
substitute
x
into
whatever
function
that
has
the
appropriate
range
for
that
x
value
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
gotcha
[sskarz]
for
example
,
if
you
have
x
>=
2
as
your
range
,
and
you
have
a
value
x
=
1
,
you
can
'
t
substitute
that
since
its
not
in
its
range
but
if
it
was
x
=
2
,
then
u
could
and
there
is
a
solution
there
this
is
all
coming
from
memory
,
so
you
should
definitely
double
check
if
you
can
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
makes
sense
I
did
it
for
one
and
I
will
do
it
for
the
rest
Thank
you
[sskarz]
okay
,
double
check
tho
!
i
don
'
t
wanna
accidentally
gaslight
you
😂
also
,
weird
that
you
'
re
doing
that
in
calculus
,
that
'
s
like
some
algebra
stuff
never
did
that
ever
in
my
calc
classes
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
trust
you
but
I
will
show
the
professor
to
check
for
sure
.
👍
Yea
idk
what
this
dude
is
doing
[sskarz]
yeah
and
that
last
thing
u
got
stuck
on
with
that
huge
ass
thingy
idk
what
that
was
about
never
seen
that
before
u
sure
u
in
calc
1
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
at
this
point
Math
is
math
Sigma
notation
[sskarz]
right
sigma
notation
stuff
...
that
was
later
in
the
calc
1
year
feels
like
your
professor
is
all
over
the
place
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
all
over
the
place
He
does
something
one
day
and
then
the
next
day
he
teaches
something
4
chapters
ahead
that
doesn
’
t
connect
in
anyway
For
a
lot
of
my
hw
problems
I
have
to
use
khan
academy
and
google
to
teach
myself
[sskarz]
yeah
no
doesn
'
t
seem
like
anything
is
connecting
together
maybe
it
'
ll
pick
up
later
in
the
semester
[prabipyakurel]
I
really
hope
so
,
but
hey

group
to

Hit

😂
😭
[sskarz]
Okay

!
Ttyl
!
👋
hey
hey
,
I
finally
got
home
❤
️
I
saw
ur
msg
but
I
was
about
to
drive
and
I
was
talking
to
someone
on
the
side
and
I
didn
’
t
want
them
to
see
ur
name
lol
how
was
your
study
session
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
thats
alright
love
,
I
realized
you
would
be
driving
so
i
wanted
to
wait
.
It
went
well
,
i
was
in
there
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
I
have
not
prepared
enough
,
I
am
literally
still
working
on
reviewingthe
key
terms
and
such
.
Other
than
that
,
I
went
to
the
office
hours
for
the
full
2
hours
and
learned
some
new
things
.
Then
attended
the
math
lecture
where
he
brought
up
a
new
topic
,
still
processing
that
.
I
finished
my
timeline
but
realized
that
my
resources
also
need
explanation
so
need
to
work
on
that
.
Also
found
out
that
we
still
got
math
homework
due
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
so
gonna
start
on
that
in
a
little
bit
.
Um
then
I
got
my
philosophy
reading
out
of
the
way
for
tomorrow
.
But
yea
not
I
am
just
doing
whatever
I
can
to
prepare
for
all
2
exams
I
have
.
sorry
that
was
a
lot
How
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
Why
are
u
apologizing
lol
,
stop
❤
️
Wow
you
sound
like
you
have
a
lot
on
your
plate
,
you
okay
?
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
am
fine
,
just
trying
to
get
through
all
of
it
,
just
when
I
thought
math
was
getting
better
,
I
literally
ran
across
so
many
other
things
i
needed
to
do
[sskarz]
Eh
it
was
okay
,
got
hit
by
some
heavy
stuff
in
lectures
with
tons
of
math
so
I
’
m
still
processing
it
all
,
and
I
guess
that
’
s
about
it
really
.
Nothing
too
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
but
hey
you
got
it
,
its
okay
.
[sskarz]
Just
focus
on
one
thing
at
a
time
,
trying
to
cover
all
at
the
same
time
will
do
you
no
good
,
so
focus
on
honing
your
skills
on
a
specific
type
of
problem
,
get
confident
,
then
move
on
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
thats
what
I
am
going
to
do
.
👍
I

When

No

❤
️
[sskarz]
Yes

5
mins
is
me
and
u
being

my
time
wisely
It
gonna
suck
letting

of

everytime
[sskarz]
Yeah
I

u
and
how
we
act
together
and
just
be

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
How
would
u
even
do
that
Like

the
sun
dial
stuff
Like
just
a
second
How
did
someone
get
the
exact
measurements
of
a
second
,
and
how
would
u
even
define
that
Also

who
tf

they

that
she

quickly

she
would
be
educated
and
have
some
sort
of
business
/
economy
degree
,
would
also
be
working
towards
her
own
goals
.
They
said
I

no
challenges

relationship
ever
,

️
hey

[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
can
I
ask
u
something
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
what
is
it
?
hey
,
what
is
it
[sskarz]
Give
me
one
second
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
Okay
,
just
know
that
I
love
u
but
Was
it
truly
a
good
thing
that
Julius
Caesar
died
from
the
Roman
Empire
era
?
like
if
we
really
think
about
it
He
ended
the
civil
war
and
voted
for
dictator
for
life
,
conquered
countries
like
Spain
before
it
was
formed
[prabipyakurel]
Instagram
😂
me
to
you
rn
[sskarz]
Made
ties
with
Egypt
[prabipyakurel]
wtf
,
literally
that
is
what
you
wanted
to
ask
[sskarz]
Like
I
just
dunno
,
how
much
impact
did
he
really
have
It
’
s
like
a
moral
dilemma
He
had
3
triumphs
that
are
paraded
for
military
accomplishments
Heavily
decorated
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
when
he
died
,
he
lost
all
influence
on
the
Roman
Empire
So
,
really
was
it
a
good
thing
?
With
how
it
all
ended
up
?
Truly
an
interesting
thing
I
was
thinking
about
[prabipyakurel]
bro
he
is
dead
and
long
gone
,
cremated
,
probably
scattered
all
over
the
place
,
leave
him
in
peace
he
is
dead
dead
love
i
am
sorry
[sskarz]
I
know
but
The
Roman
Empire
had
so
much
potential
Like
what
if

about
on

[prabipyakurel]
It
was
better
than
some
other
food
I
have
been
having
I
would
say
by
far
the
most
appetizing
meal
👍
Are
you
busy
?
[sskarz]
no
im
not
busy
just
chilling
at
my
computer
wbu
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
just
going
over
the
terms
for
my
philosophy
class
again
and
again
How
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
you
feeling
worried
?
or
just
sharpening
your
knowledge
on
it
[prabipyakurel]
both
but
i
understand
it
better
after
he
went
over
it
today
,
slightly
better
[sskarz]
pretty
good
,
had
a
great
gym
session
,
and
today
'
s
class
was
finally
a
little
challenging
,
but
i
got
everything
done
.
came
back
home
and
just
been
working
on
some
work
stuff
hey
that
'
s
good
,
when
is
your
philosophy
midterm
?
thursday
im
guessing
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
That
sounds
good
,
glad
you
had
a
good
day
!
❤
️
[sskarz]
how
'
s
your
day
been
?
im
guessing
its
been
pretty
busy
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
started
with
sociology
which
was
pretty
simple
(
other
than
the
fact
that
my
water
bottle
was
loose
and
I
had
it
in
my
backpack
so
I
spilled
some
in
there
).
Then
I
went
to
philosophy
and
got
some
more
clarification
on
terms
and
understood
them
better
.
I
went
to
sociology
office
hours
straight
hours
to
tell
him
to
check
my
timeline
project
and
realized
I
was
still
missing
some
formating
things
.
I
had
lunch
and
started
on
math
(
we
still
have
homework
and
midterms
this
week
),
and
I
attended
a
zoom
math
session
for
some
topics
so
that
was
helpful
.
I
went
to
my
last
history
class
for
the
day
which
was
normal
and
simple
.
I
had
dinner
and
finalized
the
timeline
project
and
turned
it
in
.
Also
,
my
math
midterm
is
on
friday
,
so
i
got
more
time
to
prepare
.
👍
[sskarz]
wow
you
'
ve
been
busy
alright
haha
,
hey
nice
job
on
the
sociology
project
!
hey
that
'
s
good
to
hear
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
not
too
tired
tho
,
probably
gonna
get
some
more
work
done
when
I
can
today
,
so
I
can
focus
on
something
else
tomorrow
morning
.
[sskarz]
i
just
wanna
let
you
know
that
i
'
m
proud
of
you
for
all
the
work
you
'
re
doing
❤
️
❤
️

!
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
this
was
the
first
assignment
where
I
did
all
my
research
from
books
in
the
library
and
not
websites
.
Awwww
i
love
you
so
much
,
hey
you
are
doing

over

,
always
proud
of
you

[sskarz]
i

you
so
much
!
thanks

❤
️
woah
i
don
'
t
think
i
'
ve
ever
done
that
haha
,
that
'
s
pretty
cool
tho
you
got
to
cite
straight
books
,
what
a
smartie
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
gonna
like
,
I
was
freaking
out
before
but
after
I
discovered
how
the
library
worked
and
all
,
I
wanted
to
sit
in
there
and
just
read
.
Its
so
nice
and
quiet
in
there
I
have
only
seen
like
1
floor
of
that
library
,
i
will
do
some
more
visits
to
that
place
[sskarz]
haha
see
,
this
is
why
i
also
just
go
to
the
library
on
campus
lol
👍
*
not
anymore
tho
,
but
i
used
to
like
everyday
*
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
I
understand
,
its
so
peaceful
in
there
.
I
dont
even
sit
on
the
desk
,
i
just
sit
where
my
books
were
found
like
on
the
floor
,
cris
-
cross
[sskarz]
ohhhh
there
'
s
a
lot
of
space
on
the
floor
to
do
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
so
there
are
so
many
books
and
shelves
that
a
lot
of
the
shelves
are
so
close
together
and
you
have
to
move
this
big
handle
just
to
open
up
that
section
that
you
want
and
it
creates
this
gap
that
i
fit
in
very
well
so
...
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
one
of
those
that
'
s
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
can
imagine
you
fitting
in
between
shelves
with
just
books
haha
😂
[prabipyakurel]
yea
so
i
open
them
and
like
sit
in
between
this
one
time
i
was
in
between
and
someone
started
moving
them
together
to
open
up
another
section
and
I
was
like
no
[sskarz]
omg
you
would
get
smushed
[prabipyakurel]
switched
[sskarz]
did
u
ilke
push
back
?
love
im
a
lil
dumb
dumb
[prabipyakurel]
I

❤
️

'
t

u
getting
smushed
and
then
u

an
accident
in
there
[prabipyakurel]
lol
dw
,
I
will

the
shelves
are

[sskarz]
oki
just

u
in
my
life
,

'
t
have

closing
library
shelves
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
ik
ik

,
dont
worry
,
I
will
be
careful
❤
️
omg
lol
imagine
the
news
headline
on
that
[sskarz]
i
would
not
like
to
know
my
girlfriend
died
to
something
that
tragic
😭
😂
i
would
actually
be
so
depressed
i
'
d
have
a
major
vendetta
against
bookshelves
[prabipyakurel]
No
love
,
Ik
,
I
will
be
safe
dont
worry
.
you
be
giving
them
the
side
eye
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
they
got
my
girfriend
crippled
,
i
would
go
on
a
mission
to
bury
every
single
bookshelf
i
saw
😂
but
hey
,
just
be
safe
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhhh
you
are
too
adorable
I
will
,
I
promise
❤
️
I
learned
to
sit
right
next
to
the
space
,
so
like
where
people
walk
through
instead
of
between
2
shelves
[sskarz]
ohhh
okay
yeah
you
need
to
be
near
the
escape
[prabipyakurel]
buddy
it
took
me
a
week
to
figure
out
where
the
books
i
needed
were
kept
once
i
found
them
tbh
,
i
didnt
know
where
any
of
the
exits
were
i
had
to
find
my
way
back
out
[sskarz]
omg
when
i
come
there
eventually
,
i
wanna
see
that
library
[prabipyakurel]
uh
,
you
need
your
cal
id
at
every
entrance
i
learned
that
[sskarz]
dammit
no
way
to
sneak
me
in
?
😂
[prabipyakurel]
but
maybe
they
have
like
a
visitor
pass
or
something
[sskarz]
i
doubt
that
rip
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
,
they
dont
like
scan
it
or
anything
,
they
just
look
to
see
if
you
have
the
card
,
I
can
get
you
one
of
my
friend
'
s
card
and
you
can
take
it
there
are
probably
ways
you
will
,
i
will
take
you
in
❤
️
[sskarz]
yayyyyyy
i
'
ll
look
forward
to
that
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
if
anything
when
I
get
my
new
ID
sometime
,
i
will
keep
my
old
one
and
you
got
that
to
carry
around
[sskarz]
woop
sounds
like
a
plan
👍
[prabipyakurel]
You

some
greek
yogurt
with
dark
chocolate

mini
tub
of

[prabipyakurel]
And
either
way
whenever

I

a
good
5
minutes

the
discord
chat

my
phone
away
or
something
[sskarz]
probably
gonna
get
some
tomorrow

Oh

okay
[sskarz]
send
me
the
pic
of
the
problem
,
maybe
i
can
help
?
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
this
does
look
familiar
Give
me
a
second
Is
your
goal
to
graph
it

Looks

your
line
graph
there
is
correct
The
range
is
from

9
to

5
/

Seems
like
you
got
it
,
what
part
are
you
struggling
on
?
[prabipyakurel]
Find
values
of
x
I
’
m
getting
there
slowly
[sskarz]
Which
part
specifically
are
u
struggling
with
?
I
can
try
and
explain
[prabipyakurel]
This
look
right
?
[sskarz]
yup
!
that
'
s
exactly
how
you
do
it
[prabipyakurel]
Okie
thanks
Sorry
if
you
were

you

[prabipyakurel]
Hey
love
[sskarz]
yeah
?
[prabipyakurel]
How
would
I
start
this
?
[sskarz]
probably
by
bringing
that
exponent
down
,
so
i
believe
you
can
do
natural
log
to
both
sides
to
get
rid
of
e
on
both
sides
and
the
equation
would
look
like
:
x
ln
(
4x
)
=
3x
ln
(
x
)
since
natural
log
is
base
e
,
you
can
use
that
to
cancel
out
the
e
once
u
do
that
,
u
can
solve
it
normally
[prabipyakurel]
Let
me
try
Thanks
[sskarz]
go
for
it
,
lmk
how
it
goes
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
used
the
remaining
brain
cells
for
this
Asked
for
a
few
steps
but
it
seems
easier
now

Thank
you

Anyway
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
my
my
its
been
a
day
😂
[prabipyakurel]
i
wanna
know
[sskarz]
well
,
actually
nothing
too
crazy
,
but
i
had
like
an
"
in
class
assignment
"
(
aka
quiz
)
but
it
was
open
notes
and
we
could
talk
together
and
it
was
for
my
algorthms
class
,
which
is
just
all
math
stuff
and
its
pretty
difficult
stuff
so
my
friends
and
i
all
huddled
in
the
front
corner
of
the
room
,
got
our
tables
and
formed
a
circle
together
and
we
all
worked
on
the
same
problems
together
so
much
so
,
that
we
were
1
of
2
groups
that
actually
finished
the
thing
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
lilke
little
penguin
huddle
cute
[sskarz]
and
our
class
was
huge
we
have
like
50
people
in
our
class
and
only
about
i
'
d
say
15
people
turned
it
in
,
including
my
group
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
damn
they
are
fr
testing
your
knowledge
for
sure
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
it
was
nuts
[prabipyakurel]
But
hey
,
proud
of
you
.
❤
️
Good
job
[sskarz]
we
researched
so
hard
and
my
god
,
im
so
glad
i
made
good
friends
they
are
so
smart
,
and
we
just
think
off
each
other
and
solve
problems
so
fluently
[prabipyakurel]
No
especially
when
you
are
working
together
,
you
need
to
make
sure
you
have
people
that
also
put
in
the
work
[sskarz]
thanks
love
:)
❤
️
we
all
put
in
the
work
for
sure
like
for
this
one
problem
i
'
m
ngl
,
none
of
us
would
'
ve
gotten
it
if
it
was
on
a
quiz
but
we
pieced
it
together
one
by
one
and
it
took
about
25
minutes
to
solve
❤
️
it
was
like
the
avengers
assembled
😂
😂
and
today
i
learned
,
that
'
s
the
class
im
gonna
need
to
spend
the
most
time
on
i
felt
actually
really
challenged
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
thats
good
,
at
least
you
got
it
in
[sskarz]
and
that
'
s
a
good
feeling
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
yea
it
feels
good
to
be
challenged
[sskarz]
i
say
this
because
my
english
class
,
and
2
of
my
cs
professors
are
drop
dead
easy
so
the
semester
has
been
kind
of
boring
but
i
'
m
thankful
😂
i
remember
physics
and
what
that
did
to
me
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
good
for
you
,
you
got
this
.
ugh
physics
just
high
school
physics
was
enough
for
me
i
hated
it
[sskarz]
yeah
same
i
just
wish
i
studied
for
that
ap
test
so
i
didn
'
t
have
to
go
through
that
a
second
time
😭
i
got
a
2
on
that
ap
exam
[prabipyakurel]
Its
fine
,
we
have
all
been
there
,
but
i
am
sure
you
gave
it
your
best
so
its
okay
[sskarz]
yeah
it
is
what
it
is
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
thankfully
,
I
have
the
first
half
of
my
physical
science
covered
and
just
need
like
chemistry
or
something
for
the
other
one
👍
[sskarz]

'
s
good
!

'
ll
be
okay
[prabipyakurel]

other
opportunities
too
❤
️
but
this
is
a
good
start
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
omg
so
in
office
hours
today
I
was
sitting
in
front
of
this
one
indian
dude
(
not
the
one
that
I
see
everywhere
)
and
I
have
seen
him
in
every
office
hours
and
we
were
just
discussing
math
today
for
a
little
and
I
was
helping
him
and
then
he
went
do
you
want
to
study
tonight
.
hear
me
out
,
I
said
no
because
dude
said
he
wanted
to
study
from
10
:
00
-
12
:
00
am
💀
[sskarz]
oh
nah
💀
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
like
later
on
I
was
like
I
dont
think
i
can
make
it
and
I
was
listening
to
music
at
the
same
time
right
then
5
min
later
he
was
like
you
got
a
phone
number
and
thw
way
I
said
no
[sskarz]
💀
damn
better
than
me
,
it
took
me
to
confess
my
love
and
then
i
asked
😂
[prabipyakurel]
He
looked
at
me
all
confused
like
and
went
"
you
dont
have
like
a
phone
number
?"
then
I
realized
i
just
told
the
guy
that
I
dont
have
a
phone
number
at
all
,
and
then
I
just
said
,
i
dont
give
away
numbers
so
i
gave
him
my
insta
[sskarz]
ah
okay
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
so
werid
[sskarz]
yeah
no
that
'
s
pretty
weird
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
my
friend
told
me
that
he
likes
me
[sskarz]
yup
that
sounds
about
right
call
me
whenever
he
tries
again
,
i
'
ll
give
him
the
death
stare
😂
[prabipyakurel]
The
way
me
and
my
friend
laughed
about
how
i
said
no
,
back
to
lecture
and
then
he
texted
me
after
like
10
minutes
after
i
gave
him
my
insta
,
he
left
office
hours
and
messaged
me
[sskarz]
damn
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
love
😂
❤
️
and
he
went
all
heyyyy
prabi
what
midterms
you
have
tomorrow
?
[sskarz]
omg
he
'
s
so
persistent
[prabipyakurel]
and
idk
if
he
heard
me
and
my
friend
talking
or
something
but
i
did
not
tell
the
dude
i
had
something
tomorrow
[sskarz]
gotta
appreciate
that
social
work
ethic
probably
was
listening
in
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhh
no
,
and
then
literally
just
messaged
yea
philosophy
he
told
me
to
text
him
if
i
cant
make
it
tonight
before
6
and
i
was
like
"
also
cant
be
there
to
study
"
[sskarz]
jeez
ok
in
all
seriousness
dude
is
trying
way
too
hard
,
and
now
its
kinda
creepy
ugh
i
hate
that
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
i
dont
how
how
i
feel
about
him
dont
worry
love
,
im
keeping
myself
safe
❤
️
[sskarz]
like
if
a
girl
did
that
to
me
,
i
would
be
really
uncomfortable
[prabipyakurel]
No
i
was
so
uncomfortable
[sskarz]
i
know
love
,
shut
him
down
whenever
you
need
to
[prabipyakurel]
he
asked
me
for
the
number
and
I
was
like
"
buddy
you
dont
do
that
"
thats
not
how
it
works
I
was
fr
so
mad
when
he
asked
No
I
will
love
,
if
he
says
anything
like
that
i
will
❤
️
[sskarz]

:)

'
m
so
glad
i
got
you
before
anyone
could
try
anything
[prabipyakurel]
that
guy
is
not

confessed

3k
worth
in
tech

on
the
same
day
,
its
like
UGH

i

and
the
first
thing
i

packages
😂
😂

fr
[prabipyakurel]
brb
sorry
[sskarz]
no
worries
love
[prabipyakurel]
okie
okie
me
back
quite
an
interesting
convo
with
mom
[sskarz]
welcome
back
LOVE
:)
oh
?
what
happened
?
[prabipyakurel]
ove
?
Lol
it
will
be
here
soon
dw
[sskarz]
there
u
go
😭
[prabipyakurel]
We
we
just
started
talking
and
I
was
telling
her
about
school
and
all
and
she
was
just
talking
about
the
teej
parties
and
stuff
and
how
the
turf
looks
amazing
and
then
at
the
end
..
omg
she
randomly
asked
,
do
you
and
sanskar
talk
like
chat
[sskarz]
ooooooooooooooooo
and
what
did
you
say
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
froze
for
a
good
5
seconds
😂
I
told
her
like
we
talked
a
little
through
insta
over
the
summer
and
she
paused
and
just
went
mhm
ok
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
😂
hey
love
before
you
say
anything
,
i
swear
to
you
i
haven
'
t
said
anything
to
her
or
anyone
i
just
said
namaste
in
the
teej
and
left
it
at
that
😂
[prabipyakurel]
and
she
went
like
oh
he
posts
pictures
or
something
,
and
i
went
like
small
stories
sometimes
and
she
just
went
i
see
and
went
mhm
,
and
then
proceeded
to
saying
,
"
anyways
good
night
and
study
well
"
It
was
so
random
,
my
hands
were
like
shaking
I
trust
you
lol
I
am
pretty
sure
she
did
not
start
thinking
we
were
dating
just
because
you
said
namaste
and
smiled
but
i
am
sure
she
knows
nothing
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
got
my
heart
racing
i
'
m
ngl
😂
that
is
really
random
[prabipyakurel]
no
it
was
and
the
fact
the
she
didnt
have
a
follow
up
question
got
me
thinking
I
was
about
to
explode
here
[sskarz]
what
do
you
think
?
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
usually
means
she
is
thinking
of
something
and
she
probably
likes
you
now
if
my
dad
and
brother
start
asking
,
idk
that
would
make
me
think
but
mom
is
fine
,
she
probably
just
saw
how
cute
and
nice
you
were
at
kreepa
'
s
party
and
the
teej
party
.
[sskarz]
gotta
be
the
best
to
show
the
best
😤
[prabipyakurel]
you
are
the
best
love
❤
️
[sskarz]
that
is
quite
interesting
tho
huh
[prabipyakurel]
you
dont
even
have
to
worry
[sskarz]
no
ur
the
best
trust
me
[prabipyakurel]
no
because
we
went
from
talking
about
turf
to
that
like
it
was
an
instant
random
question
"
do
you
talk
to
sanskar
"
[sskarz]
seems
like
she
'
s
been
meaning
to
ask
you
,
just
didn
'
t
know
how
so
she
got
impatient
?
or
just
general
curiosity
either
way
,
if
they
'
re
thinking
about
you
talking
to
me
,
good
sign
!
[prabipyakurel]
Perhaps
,
maybe
lol
[sskarz]
now
let
'
s
continue
our
fake
convos
a
little
more
through
organic
memes
or
something
like
that
,
and
make
a
reputable
conversation
and
degree
of
friendship
[prabipyakurel]
NO
fr
,
usually
if
i
tell
her
i
am
talking
to
a
friend
over
chat
and
it
was
a
dude
she
used
to
be
like
"
who
is
it
"
"
why
",
and
when
i
told
her
i
talked
to
you
for
a
little
she
just
went
mhm
ok
and
then
told
me
good
night
i
was
like
expecting
a
"
dont
fall
in
love
lecture
"
[sskarz]
you
'
ve
gotten
that
before
when
talking
to
guys
?
😂
hahaha
that
'
s
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
why
insta
needs
to
stay
neutral
i
cant
show
discord
cant
show
number
because
you
asked
on
discord
,
connections
so
insta
it
is
[sskarz]
yeah
but
we
should
build
more
of
a
conversation
repertoire
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
and
because
brother
knows
we
talked
on
insta
before
[sskarz]
so
its
believable
[prabipyakurel]
we
got
months
love
dw
[sskarz]
like
here
'
s
my
thinking
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
dedicate
a
week
before
to
make
it
like
we
have
not
been
talking
to
each
other
everyday
Oh
yea
[sskarz]
if
i
show
a
little
more
interest
in
our
insta
chats
over
time
,
like
maybe
once
a
week
or
once
every
two
weeks
,
it
can
get
them
thinking
if
they
ask
again
can
'
t
talk
too
much
otherwise
its
obvious
can
'
t
talk
too
little
or
the
idea
is
fading
gotta
keep
it
just
right
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
its
okay
,
sometimes
out
of
the
blue
ask
how
life
is
at
random
and
i
will
do
the
same
[sskarz]
most
organic
way
is
if
u
post
a
story
,
or
if
i
do
,
we
can
reply
to
it
and
have
a
short
convo
and
go
from
there
that
way
it
doesn
'
t
seem
so
random
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
thats
what
imma
do
now
[sskarz]
same
keeps
interest
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
again
not
too
often
but
just
enough
so
that
its
a
silent
factor
[prabipyakurel]
and
that
way
if
they
ever
go
,
so
what
do
you
talk
about
i
can
be
like
random
stuff
nothing
too
deep
yk
[sskarz]
yeah
and
if
they
ever
ask
to
see
our
chat
u
can
show
them
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
[sskarz]
and
it
'
ll
be
an
indicator
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
not
that
we
'
re
dating
,
but
we
are
talking
like
friends
and
it
'
ll
get
them
into
the
idea
of
us
being
together
that
can
snowball
into
bigger
things
for
us
later
down
the
road
[prabipyakurel]
Dont
worry
,
my
mom
likes
you
as
a
person
,
i
can
already
tell
❤
️
oh
yea
keep
it
formal
so
they
can
be
like
,
"
you
talk
about
anything
else
"
[sskarz]
great
news
,
now
i
just
gotta
become
the
best
so
they
consider
me
to
the
highest
degree
over
all
other
guys
😂
i
'
ll
put
my
formal
texting
on
dw
😂
i
text
in
a
very
different
way
with
people
i
don
'
t
know
or
don
'
t
talk
to
very
often
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
,
they
probably
already
think
you
are
the
best
i
heard
them
talking
about
you
and
me
once
[sskarz]
gotta
be
better
than
best
😤
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
when
we
came
back
from
the
one
time
you
showed
me
the
vinyls
they
were
like
"
so
sanskar
huh
"
and
i
walked
in
and
they
smiled
and
stopped
You
already
are
love
,
dont
even
worry
[sskarz]
and
they
still
thinking
about
it
,
its
a
great
sign
just
gotta
keep
it
going
subtle
but
effective
[prabipyakurel]
It
really
is
but
hey
we
did
good
fooling
people
in
person
we
can
do
it
online
[sskarz]
my
parents
don
'
t
even
hide
it
from
me
,
unlike
your
parents
they
just
like
"
SO
PRABI

their
heads
,

make
them
consider
it
more
everytime

about
me
❤
️
that
'
s
how
we
play

to
my

with
the
the
day
before
,
and
I
could
not
stop
staring
at
you
i
swear
,
I
was
like
glancing
and
everything
until
i
could
not
handle
it
so
i
went
to
the
kitchen
to
check
up
on
something
that
didnt
need
to
be
checked
😂
[sskarz]

going
down
as
a
modern
classic
still
my
favorite
movie
this
year
[prabipyakurel]
I
really
wanted
it
to
be
true
at
that
time

know
❤
️

it
seemed
pretty
cool
[sskarz]

wanted
to
just
scream
it
to
you
and
hug
you
had
to
play
it
cool
just
to
inevitably
get
screwed
over
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]

your
entire
family
was
there
and
i
was
like
"
yep

life
"
no

played
it
cool
,
i
mean
we
could
have
acted
like

talked
as
friends
but
we
didnt
and
I
am
glad
literally
acted
like
we
had
not
caught
up
in
like
months
[sskarz]

official
relationship

our
insta
chats

okay
[sskarz]
yeah
for
sure
dw
i
got
that
on
lock
ALTHO
💀
okay
so
nothing
bad
but
earlier
today
when
you
msged
that
i
was
in
class
and
u
said
ttyl
i
was
gonna
reply
back
to
u
and
i
was
sitting
right
next
to
my
friend
,
and
i
noticed
from
my
peripheral
vision
he
was
just
LASERING
my
phone
screen
,
and
i
pulled
away
so
fast
and
he
was
like
,
who
u
talking
to
?
i
was
like
dw
about
it
,
and
he
was
like
yeah
honestly
i
just
saw
discord
and
something
red
,
but
i
didn
'
t
see
anything
dw
my
heart
was
about
to
explode
,
i
was
like
holy
shit
not
like
he
'
s
close
to
my
family
or
anything
at
all
,
but
that
was
the
closest
anyone
'
s
ever
been
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
lol
you
know
sometimes
when
you
have
class
till
8
i
wait
so
long
to
message
you
and
i
just
start
with
hey
how
was
your
day
because
i
keep
on
thinking
that
sometimes
you
will
be
eating
dinner
with
your
family
with
the
phone
on
the
table
,
and
when
you
go
help
or
put
dishes
in
the
sink
someone
gonna
be
like
,
so
hmm
you
do
talk
to
her
thats
why
i
try
not
to
start
with
hey
love
😂
since
you
have
notifications
on
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
,
won
'
t
happen
.
every
time
i
leave
my
phone
out
in
the
open
,
its
always
locked
and
it
requires
faceID
but
i
rarely
ever
leave
my
phone
out
of
my
sight
its
very
rare
that
i
leave
it
out
of
my
pocket
somewhere
my
family
can
access
it
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
gotcha
[sskarz]
also
my
notifs
hide
your
messages
as
in
,
it
'
ll
show
discord
,
but
nothing
else
no
name
,
no
message
till
its
unlocked
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
okie
okie
and
i
also
dont
want
you
to
be
showing
someone
a
video
or
something
and
my
name
pops
up
saying
hey
love
idk
i
have
imagined
that
happening
[sskarz]
that
is
probably
more
likely
to
happening
,
but
if
im
outside
somewhere
,
and
there
'
s
a
chance
for
u
to
msg
me
,
i
preemptively
turn
on
DND
on
my
phone
,
not
discord
so
no
notifs
come
up
trust
me
,
i
'
m
very
secure
most
of
the
time
when
it
comes
to
these
kinds
of
life
breaking
secrets
,
i
'
m
very
aware
of
everything
that
could
question
the
integrity
of
the
secret
not
that
i
keep
anything
more
than
this
tho
lol
😂
[prabipyakurel]

I

she

asking

I
was
like
"
a
few
yes

I
am
sure
I
can
find
more
that

going
through
the

mental
and

[prabipyakurel]
Probably

look
at
his
new
profile
and
name

[sskarz]

him
a
quote
or
something

one
[sskarz]

the
last
thing

the
wrong
material
or
wrong
product
Make
sure
when
you
are
putting
it
together

to
also
read
and
understand
imagine
the
chair
situation
happening

representation
[prabipyakurel]
3
[sskarz]
hmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
literally
the
number
3
pops
up
in
my
head
[sskarz]
yeah
i
think
we
'
ll
be
a
lot
closer
to
our
dream
in
3
years
I
think
so
or
is
it
too
soon
[prabipyakurel]
a
lot
closer
for
sure
though
3
years
from
now
,
a
lot
will
change
,
for
the
better
,
and
it
is
not
too
soon
we
will
both
be
done
with
college
and
be
doing
something
extra
getting
to
our
goals
little
by
little
❤
️
[sskarz]
yeah
,
i
just
wanna
know
how
we
will
be
in
3
years
like
what
'
s
the
situation
like
yk
i
wish
i
could
peer
into
the
future
[prabipyakurel]
the
same
love
dw
❤
️
[sskarz]
awwwww
oh
no
im
sure
of
that
[prabipyakurel]
meh
,
we
will

when
we
get
there
[sskarz]
mhmmm
i
love
u
for
years
to

[prabipyakurel]

little
more
freedom
,
less

MY
LOVE
FOR
YOU

BE
STILL
THE
SAME
,
I
LOVE
YOUUUUUUUUUUU

ADORABLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
❤
️
GIMME
U
RN
❤
️
i
think
we
will
have
more
freedom
,
and
at
that
point
i
think
our
families
will
be
aware
of
some
level
at
that
point
whether
we
tell
them
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
see
but
even
if
we
dont
tell
them
,
after
i
get
a
degree
,
I
can
tell
them
I
am
going
somewhere
and
they
will
be
fine
[sskarz]
hopefully
lol
hmmm
okay
question
for
u
if
it
was
just
up
to
u
,
what
'
s
the
perfect
time
u
think
for
u
,
to
tell
our
parents
and
let
that
embargo
lift
[prabipyakurel]
Last
year
of
law
school

like
6
years
or

ig
like
2nd
year
[sskarz]
i
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
are
you
fine
with
that
love
im
sorry
is
that
is
a
lot
of
time
to
wait
[sskarz]
no
no
don
'
t
be
sorry
,
it
'
s
okay
i
won
'
t
lie
,
it
'
s
a
really
long
time
and
i
'
m
not
too
sure
if
i
can
do
that
for
6
years
,
but
we
'
ll
see
i
understand
you
tho
and
don
'
t
be
sorry
okay
i
appreciate
your
answer
and
i
get
where
you
are
coming
from
i
'
m
just
...
unsure
i
'
ll
think
about
it
and
no
this
isn
'
t
a
deal
breaker
at
all
okay
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
no

️
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
thank
you
i

you

[sskarz]
i
love
you

and
for
sure
,
who
knows
maybe
I
will
be
able
to
tell
them
after
graduation
and
all
[sskarz]
The
only
reason
I
would
want
to
tell
them
is
because
it
would
give
peace
of
mind
,
and
also
give
us
a
lot
more
freedom
yk
?
Idk
if
I
can
do
6
straight
years
of
having
to
sneak
you
around
with
me
and
doing
that
,
in
6
years
that
’
s
going
wrong
somewhere
somehow
eventually
and
being
found
out
That
’
s
what
I
’
m
concerned
about
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
completely
understand
,
trust
me
I
dont
want
to
have
to
sneak
around
either
,
and
I
will
definitely
think
about
it
.
I
just
dont
want
them
to
be
like
,
you
are
too
young
for
this
you
know
even
if
they
like
the
idea
[sskarz]
No
yeah
I
understand
,
don
’
t
worry
I
’
ll
be
here
for
a
very
long
time
.
There
’
s
no
one
else
I
would
want
more
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
But
sanskar
,
I
will
change
in
3
years
and
maybe
I
will
tell
them
so
that
we
can
be
more
comfortable
you
know
Once
I
get
into
law
school
and
graduate
from
here
,
we
will
see
I
will
and
have
been
considering
it
[sskarz]
That
’
s
why
I
wish
I
could
see
into
the
future
,
things
like
this
And
I
don
’
t
mean
to
force
you
at
all
okay
If
you
don
’
t
feel
comfortable
,
I
am
not
at
all
trying
to
pressure
you
[prabipyakurel]
You
never
pressure
me
sanskar
,
we
are
in
this
together
love
,
never
think
that
way
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
But
hey
,
I
’
ll
be
here
all
the
time
any
time
okay
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
I
know
you
will
,
i
cant
live
without
you
❤
️
[sskarz]
Don
’
t
worry
,
whenever
we
have
to
tell
parents
doesn
’
t
change
the
fact
that
I
love
you
and
I
want
to
be
with
you
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
and
i
cant
ever
loose
you
in
anyway
[sskarz]
You
’
ll
never
lose
me
love
,
ever
❤
️
I
promise
you
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
so
much
,
but
I
will
think
about
it
okay
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
Thank
you
for
considering
love
,
it
really
does
mean
a
lot
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
will
,
Its
not
a
bad
idea
,
and
looking
at
the
circumstances
in
the
future
when
the
time
comes
,
who
knows
,
i
might
just
tell
them
.
[sskarz]
Things
will
probably
change
and
you
’
re
gonna
be
a
grown
up
too
,
so
I
don
’
t
think
they
’
d
reject
if
you
did
.
But
again
,
only
if
you
are
comfortable
Not
that
you
’
re
not
a
grown
up
,
but
yk
not
having
parents
watch
over
your
shoulder
every
day
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
be
,
I
am
comfortable
,
you
never
force
me
to
do
anything
okay
love
.
Yep
things
will
change
and
it
will
get
easier
trust
me
❤
️
if
we
do
tell
them
after
graduation
,
are
you
planning
on
telling
each
of
our
parents
on
our
own
,
or
like
together
just
curious
[sskarz]
That
’
s
…
a
good
question
I
haven
’
t
thought
that
far
What
would
you
prefer
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
me
neither
uh
i
need
you
there
with
me
[sskarz]
Then
together
it
is
:)
I
’
ll
stand
by
you
as
we
tell
them
okay
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
freeze
or
they
will
think
i
am
joking
[sskarz]
I
will
defend
us
❤
️
Not
that
they
are
gonna
be
super
abrasive
,
at
least
I
hope
not
,
but
I
will
stand
by
you
confidently
[prabipyakurel]
They
wont
,
i
just
dont
know
how
to
say
it
to
their
face
alone
😭
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
,
a
future
problem
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
we
will
see
yea
[sskarz]
We
will
handle
it
together
I
’
ll
hold
your
hand
and
make
sure
you
’
re
okay
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
see
when
time
comes
[sskarz]
Yeah
but
for
now
,
we
both
need
to
focus
on
our
goals
First
that
,
then
us
[prabipyakurel]
yea
for
sure
we
got
places
to
be
and
goals
to
reach
❤
️
we
do
that
and
then
we
worry
about
the
rest
I
mean
i
feel
like
eventually
things
will
just
start
coming
together
after
we
complete
our
education
anyway
.
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
have
a
good
feeling
about
that
as
well
❤
️
Things
will
fall
into
place
naturally
[prabipyakurel]

I

How

?
[prabipyakurel]
So
for
sociology
,
he
assigned
a
5
-
7
page
paper
,
which
is
a
later
problem
.
For
Philosophy
,
it
went
well
,
we
had
2
definitions
of
100
or
more
words
and
then
2
essays
from
300
-
500
words
.
I
am
telling
you
it
was
not
enough
time
,
but
I
wrote
what
i
needed
and
it
was
good
.
Um
then
after
that
class
ended
i
took
15
min
to
eat
lunch
and
then
ran
across
campus
to
the
math
office
hours
from
1
-
3
,
then
forgot
I
had
math
discussions
at
3
:
30
,
so
I
went
there
.
After
that
was
done
,
I
went
to
history
,
which
was
a
movie
,
but
it
was
dark
in
there
and
I
only
got
a
little
bit
of
math
done
in
there
.
After
that
I
had
dinner
and
came
back
and
did
the
sociology
quiz
.
Roommates
are
gone
,
and
I
am
alone
.
Probably
gonna
start
studying
again
[sskarz]
Oh
okay
Go
study
love
,
we
’
ll
talk
later
[prabipyakurel]
no
not
rn
i
am
gonna
wait
till
like
a
little
later
like
30
minutes
i
need
to
think
for
a
min
[sskarz]
Okay
that
sounds
good
But
hey
,
I
’
m
glad
everything
went
well
for
you
!
[prabipyakurel]
It
did
,
got
more
math
concepts
down
as
well
.
👍
[sskarz]
I
was
worried
all
day
today
wondering
what
would
’
ve
happened
[prabipyakurel]
nah
it
was
fine
,
my
legs
are
killing
me
,
but
im
sitting
rn
so

getting
better
[sskarz]
But

ve
got
nothing
to
be
worried
about
it
seems
❤
️
Yeah

a
breather
okay

[prabipyakurel]
No

math
rn

everything
opened
and
I
was
like

My
day
was
good
,
didn
’
t
do
much
till
my
one
class
,

that
and
then
I
found
a
group
of
guys
just
playing
chess
out
on
campus
so
I
joined
them
and
played
so
that
was
good
.
Then
came
back
home
,

on
an
essay
that
’
s
due

the
school
and
mine

spaced

[prabipyakurel]
What

[sskarz]
For
breakfast

go
to
the
dining
halls
?
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
don
’
t
feel
too
hungry
,
probably
gonna
have
coffee
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
but
like
I
am
not
a
big
breakfast
person
And
during
weekends
they
mix
breakfast
and
lunch
so
it
all
opens
at
11
:
00
[sskarz]
Ohhh
I
gotcha
Yeah
idk
I
’
m
not
really
a
breakfast
person
either
Coffee
is
my
go
to
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
remember
when
I
had
orientation
they
have
breakfast
and
I
used
to
be
like
okay
let
’
s
try
it
Didn
’
t
feel
too
good
eating
that
much
in
the
morning
So
I
was
like
,
I
will
stock
up
a
few
breakfast
snacks
and
coffee
[sskarz]
From
the
dining
halls
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[sskarz]
Oh
that
’
s
pretty
smart
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
during
orientation
it
was
in
paper
plates
,
so
I
used
to
get
breakfast
and
bring
it
up
and
eat
it
here
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
nice
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
I
felt
sick
with
literally
everything
,
the
food
,
the
weather
and
Covid
speeding
the
first
week
so
I
just
stopped
the
breakfast
thing
[sskarz]
No
yeah
I
remember
that
week
,
it
was
a
pretty
rough
start
But
you
’
re
okay
now
Glad
that
you
’
re
not
sick
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
no
I
am
good
now
dw
It
was
just
everything
at
once
that
week
I
was
also
missing
family
a
lot
Yea
first
and
second
week
was
rough
But
I
am
okay
now
❤
️
[sskarz]
I
’
m
really
happy
that
you
’
re
getting
a
little
more
comfortable
[prabipyakurel]
Starting
to
fit
in
.
It
’
s
okay
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
’
s
good
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
still
gonna
order
pepper
spray
[sskarz]
You
definitely
should
[prabipyakurel]
But
other
then
that
we
are
good
No
people
are
really
weird
here
There
are
so
many
police
cars
around
like
building
and
school
sometimes
[sskarz]
Jeez
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
hear
them
using
the
microphone
And
ambulance
and
fire
trucks
all
of
them
[sskarz]
Maybe
you
’
re
just
in
the
more
sketchy
area
of
Berkeley
?
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
this
is
near
downtown
Berkeley
It
is
sketchy
!
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
Like
after
sun
sets
,
I
freak
out
if
I
am
not
back
here
[sskarz]
All
the
more
important
for
the
pepper
spray
I
don
’
t
want
you
getting
hurt
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
I
won
’
t
love
,
don
’
t
worry
,
if
it
comes
to
the
point
where
someone
is
chasing
me
or
something
I
will
just
run
or
avoid
them
in
the
first
place
I
will
watch
myself
love
,
dw
❤
️
[sskarz]
Okay
I

you
,
but

get
that
pepper
spray
okay
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

but
like
when
I

it
again
and
it
was
another
one
[sskarz]
omg
💀

is
true
😂
how
did
you
find
my
story
THAT
fast
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
eating
and
looking
through
insta
then
refreshed
the
page
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
and
opened
it
[sskarz]
that
'
s
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
my
like
would
not
send
[sskarz]
i
changed
it
because
i
wanted
to
put
some
code
on
the
screen
and
make
it
actually
look
like
a
workflow
but
i
closed
everything
before
the
picture
,
so
i
opened
everything
back
up
[prabipyakurel]
so
i
thought
it
was
on
my
end
,
and
then
came
upstairs
and
it
was
different
I
thought
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
rn
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
'
s
crazy
no
no
you
'
re
okay
you

haha
i
was
actually
using
that
workflow
in
that
pic
,
but
i
closed
everything
once
i
finished
and
then
i
was
like
damn
i
should
'
ve
taken
a
picture
of
that
[prabipyakurel]

s

laptop
alot
because
its
lasts
so
long
and
it
performs
beautifully
,
and
no
sound
at
all
coming
from
the
machine

worth
it
lasted
8
hours
,
then
i
charged
it
in
an
hour
back
to
80
%
[prabipyakurel]
No

Wbu

[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okie
well
my
day
was
boring
pretty
much
,
got
a
sense
of
the
outline
I
want
for
my
history
and
sociology
paper
,
almost
done
summarizing
all
of
my
documents
.
I
studied
some
LSAT
question
because
I
ran
out
of
things
to
do
.
And
I
eventually
got
so
bored
that
I
went
to
go
check
out
the
frozen
yogurt
place
and
it
was
awesome
.
I
am
currently
still
continuing
some
more
work
and
eating
this
packaged
butter
chicken
rice
thing
that
takstes
like
tomato
sauce
and
rice
.
Pretty
much
it
.
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
nice
,
see
i
told
u
that
frozen
yogurt
place
got
some
merit
to
it
if
everyone
wants
to
go
there
haha
that
'
s
good
tho
love
,
i
'
m
glad
you
had
a
boring
day
and
not
a
stressful
one
[prabipyakurel]
Was

my
way
up
here
[sskarz]

😘
How
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
um
,
quite
productive
actually
even
on
just
4
hours
of
sleep
which
is
wild
.
started
the
day
off
in
the
study
room
and
finished
my
lab
which
wasn
'
t
that
bad
.
And
then
i
played
with
my
buddies
for
about
2
hours
then
i
got
back
to
working
on
my
laptop
and
organizing
my
workflow
for
classes
tomorrow
.
After
that
,
I
went
to
the
gym
and
had
a
good
workout
despite
me
absolutely
not
wanting
to
go
😂,
gotta
do
what
you
gotta
do
!
Finally
,
I
went
by
Marshalls
to
see
if
I
could
get
another
water
bottle
since
I
lost
the
other
one
last
week
,
and
there
was
no
small
thermoflask
type
bottle
so
I
'
m
just
gonna
get
one
tomorrow
at
the
book
store
.
Came
home
,
took
a
shower
,
and
then
I
started
organizing
my
entire
room
because
I
realized
that
EVERYTHING
was
out
of
order
,
so
just
been
trying
to
organize
stuff
and
not
have
a
giant
hidden
mess
😅
that
'
s
about
it
tho
i
got
some
baked
hot
cheetos
that
i
got
from
sams
club
since
they
'
re
lower
in
calories
,
and
just
been
munching
on
that
as
a
late
night
snack
i
said
nah
,
not
doing
fasting
tonight
right
after
i
said
to
u
i
was
gonna
fast
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
wow
yea
you
gotta
sleep
well
tonight
love
.
But
your
room
is
probably
not
that
big
of
a
mess
lol
.
baked
ones
are
meh
,
but
they
are
fine
It
happens
lol
,
its
okay
,
I
do
that
too
[sskarz]
i
actually
don
'
t
mind
it
,
its
like
less
spice
on
each
chip
and
each
chip
feels
a
little
more
hollow
,
but
its
better
than
nothing
lol
oh
no
its
**
bad
**
let
me
show
you
a
picture
of
one
of
the
drawers
im
dreading
to
clean
out
[prabipyakurel]
did
you
just
say
because
its
less
spicy
,
THEN
WHY
YOU
EATING
THE
GOD
DAMN
THING
?
[sskarz]
It
’
s
my
tech
drawer

there
are
so
many
cords
and
cables
because

just
want
chips

😭
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

the
wires
together

dividers

just
all
over
preparing
for
tomorrow
since
I
'
ve
never
tried
going
to
school
with
so
much
different
hardware
,
need
to
make
sure
I
account
for
everything
all
my
classes
rely
on
some
software
to
work
on
my
PC
,
and
on
a
Mac
I
needed
to
make
sure
everything
works
as
intended
and
like
how
it
works
on
my
old
laptop
but
I
'
m
good
on
that
now
,
just
organizing
my
backpack
and
my
iPad
80
%
done
just
like
you
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh

nice
,
yea
get
everything
ready
make
sure
you
dont
forget
the
charger
[sskarz]
but

'
re
not
disturbing
me
either
[prabipyakurel]
and

it
all
figured
out
[prabipyakurel]
okie
[sskarz]
everything
rn
is
90
%
and
above
minus
my
watch
,
but
its
just
the
watch
and
it
'
ll
last
all
day
tomorrow
anyway
so
we
'
re
good
👍
[prabipyakurel]
meh
,
watch
is
fine
just
make
sure
you
have
everything
needed
to
study
[sskarz]
yup
also
deciding
to
keep
a
notebook
and
pencil
just
in
case
[prabipyakurel]
yea
you
should
always
keep
it
just
in
case
[sskarz]
i
thought
i
could
just
get
rid
of
it
,
but
last
time
i
had
to
use
one
in
one
of
my
classes
,
and
idk
if
he
'
s
gonna
repeat
that
yeah
definitely
would
reduce
the
weight
of
my
backpack
,
but
oh
well
its
not
that
heavy
,
but
i
like
having
it
light
lol
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
try
doing
that
too
,
but
days
when
i
have
math
,
I
carry
like
2
notebooks
,
laptop
and
mathbook
and
it
gets
pretty
heavy
[sskarz]
omg
i
was
just
cleaning
out
my
backpack
,
and
i
found
a
lens
wiper
for
glasses
😂
[prabipyakurel]
but
yea
manage
it
so
its
easier
damn
,
you
still
have
your
glasses
or
you
threw
it
out
?
[sskarz]
you
know
,
sometimes
I
look
at
old
pictures
of
myself
and
I
think
about
how
I
used
to
wear
glasses
,
I
'
m
so
used
to
not
having
any
glasses
anymore
I
forgot
I
used
them
all
my
life
my
dad
took
them
the
day
I
had
my
surgery
and
threw
them
away
,
which
I
was
kinda
mad
about
but
it
is
what
it
is
I
still
have
my
other
glasses
,
including
my
first
ever
pair
he
'
s
not
getting
rid
of
any
of
those
it
'
s
a
reminder
of
who
I
was
and
how
I
became
who
I
am
today
yk
?
I
like
to
keep
things
like
that
always
remind
yourself
of
how
you
'
ve
progressed
in
your
life
and
see
how
far
you
'
ve
come
,
helps
whenever
you
'
re
feeling
down
about
something
in
the
present
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
no
yea
keep
those
I
still
have
my
first
second
and
third
pair
lol
its
just
everywhere
[sskarz]
that
'
s
great
love
,
keep
them
they
'
re
precious
[prabipyakurel]
You

cute
before
,

are
cute
today

forever
remain
cute
with
or
without
glasses
love
❤
️
[sskarz]
awwwwww
I
love
you
my
cutie
patootieeeee
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
i
used
to
wear
my
first
pair
when
I
needed
to
sleep
and
watch
something
so
in
case
it
breaks
its
not
my
actual
one
with
better
perscription
I
only
started
in
8th
grade
but
it
feels
nice
to
keep
it
[sskarz]
hey
just
letting
you
know
,
if
you
wear
the
wrong
prescription
for
an
extended
period
of
time
,
it
can
mess
up
your
eyes
even
more
[prabipyakurel]
yea
thats
why
i
dont
anymore
the
first
pair
,
its
hard
to
see
out
of
[sskarz]
that
is
wild
,
i
used
to
wear
glasses
since
i
was
conscious
of
life
😂
[prabipyakurel]
damn
no
its
okay
i
knew
my
eye
sight
was
getting
worse
and
worse
if
they
didnt
do
that
random
eye
exam
in
7th
grade
and
the
report
wasnt
send
to
my
parents
I
would
have
probably
not
gotten
them
till
later
It
was
getting
a
little
blurry
near
the
end
of
7th
grade
but
i
never
told
them
,
yea
even
the
doctor
was
surprised
when
she
told
me
to
read
and
I
went
,
sorry
,
cant
imma
need
to
see
some
little
sanskar
pics
later
in
life
they
are
probably
the
cutest
thing
[sskarz]

the
transition

❤
️
😂
i
love
you
sooooooo
much
so
I
'
m
trying
out
this
new
planner
right
I
'
m
literally
trying
to
organize
my
entire
life
rn
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
[sskarz]
and
since
I
'
m
fully
into
the
apple
ecosystem
,
I
thought
it
'
d
be
easier
to
just
sync
everything
across
devices
and
make
my
life
easier
👍
[prabipyakurel]
planner
is
fun
,
as
long
as
you
keep
up
with
it
[sskarz]
so
I
got
this
planner
called
Structure
[prabipyakurel]
ohh
nice
nice
[sskarz]
I
think
it
looks
so
aesthetically
pleasing
just
super
minimalist
I
do
keep
up
with
one
,
but
it
was
a
little
outdated
so
I
'
m
switching
my
systems
to
some
more
modern
solutions
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
no
that
looks
nice
the
black
background
and
not
too
many
words
[sskarz]
I
just
realized
I
marked
the
wrong
times
for
my
events
💀
let
me
fix
this
up
hold
on
[prabipyakurel]
ah
loser
😂
sorry
lol
[sskarz]
yeah
I
'
m
a
sucker
for
minimalist
setups
your
loser
:)
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
go
fix
it
now
make
sure
you
mark
all
the
times
correctly
[sskarz]
I
will
love
and
u
can
also
focus
on
ur
work
while
i
fix
this
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
in
classic
sanskar
fashion
,
in
30
minutes
😂
I
'
ve
done
nothing
for
my
planner
😂
Instead
,
I
cleaned
out
my
email
of
all
the
junk
and
got
rid
of
all
the
unneccessary
email
subscriptions
now
I
'
ll
actually
get
to
the
task
planner
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
damn
You
go
dude
You
don
’
t
check
emails
everyday
[sskarz]
yes
ma
'
am
🫡
👍
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
have
more
than
like
2
unread
emails
[sskarz]
i
do
,
but
for
the
past
like
couple
months
,
maybe
year
,
i
'
ve
gotten
so
much
email
that
is
just
super
unneccessary
and
i
realized
it
made
me
check
my
email
for
anything
important
way
less
often
so
i
had
to
clean
it
out
its
good
now
look
at
you
go
girl
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
make
sure
to
just
mark
all
as
read
when
unnecessary
I
just
can
’
t
handle
seeing
unread
emails
Some
psychopaths
be
having
like
200
+
unread
And
I
am
like
why
[sskarz]
😂
yeah
,
only
psychopaths
would
have
more
than
200
...
ahem
anyways
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nooo
[sskarz]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Sanskar
It
’
s
okay
love
[sskarz]

know
how
i
managed
that
literally
half
of
them
were
chess
email
notifications
saying
i
can
make
a
move
💀
biggest
email
spammer
i
swear
[prabipyakurel]
Bruh
[sskarz]
i
was
like
,
i
don
'
t
need
an
email
for
every
single
move
made
[prabipyakurel]
Select
and
mark
it
read
right
away
[sskarz]
no
i
straight
disabled
notifications
from
the
website
and
deleted
all
the
emails
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

works
too
[sskarz]
so

’
t

t

'
t

[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
For

[sskarz]
ah

,

chillin
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
ik
But
still
[sskarz]
i
know
love
i
appreciate
your
concern
:)
❤
️
i
love
u
!
[prabipyakurel]
Love
you
!!!
Do
you
usually
use
a
digital
planner
?
[sskarz]
yeah
i
'
m
a
compsci
student
and
tech
lover
,
so
im
pushing
for
all
my
workflow
to
be
digitalized
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
I
’
m
here
writing
everything
down
on
a
dry
erase
board
[sskarz]
especially
being
in
this
apple
ecosystem
,
i
'
m
trying
to
transfer
my
old
android
workflow
to
an
apple
workflow
so
that
'
s
why
it
'
s
taking
me
a
while
to
do
all
this
whatever
works
for
you
love
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
[sskarz]
i
know
people
that
rather
just
do
everything
with
physical
notebooks
and
white
boards
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
do
the
white
board
and
the
reminder
app
[sskarz]
personally
,
i
much
prefer
having
my
stuff
sync
across
multiple
devices
so
i
can
bring
my
workflow
with
me
anywhere
[prabipyakurel]
Like
this
one
[sskarz]
that
'
s
good
!
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
you
are
a
busy
person
,
you
need
it
like
that
,
that
’
s
good
.
Gracias
,
the
only
thing
that
I
won
’
t
forget
about
Ngl
I
have
downloaded
digital
planners
and
eventually
I
’
m
just
like
Nah
it
’
s
not
for
me
[sskarz]
yeah
its
not
for
everyone
but
it
helps
me
because
my
phone
is
the
first
thing
i
use
when
i
wake
up
,
and
my
planner
would
let
me
know
what
part
of
the
day
im
at
and
what
i
need
to
take
care
of
so
that
'
s
how
i
get
stuff
done
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
that
’
s
pretty
smart
!
Proud
of
you
love
.
Get
back
to
work
Finish
this
so
you
can
rest
love
[sskarz]
proud
of
me
for
what
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Everything
You
are
busy
and
you
handle
things
well
Just
proud
of
you
[sskarz]
i
'
m
most
proud
of
you
love
,
you
'
re
my
inspiration
to
keep
going
and
being
positive
:)
you
remind
me
of
the
best
parts
of
life
,
love
and
how
powerful
it

[sskarz]
For
the
week
,
I
go
on
Tuesdays
,
Thursdays
,
Fridays
,
Saturdays
,
Sundays
That
'
s
why
lol
cuz
on
monday
wednesday
,
class
starting
at
11
means
i
need
to
wake
up
around
6
and
go
at
that
time
and
people
that
have
work
at
8
are
usually
there
,
which
means
its
packed
and
i
can
'
t
wake
up
that
early
consistently
usually
😂
so
I
don
'
t
even
try
,
5
days
a
week
is
more
than
enough
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
dw
just

cool
tho
Perfectly
made
a
schedule

I
just
need
to
do
that
a
couple
more
times
[prabipyakurel]
You
got
it
How
much
longer
do
you
think
this
will
take
?
[sskarz]
um
,
maybe
10
mins
?
adding
it
will
be
easy
,
just
fine
tuning
some
of
the
events
and
stuff
👍

[prabipyakurel]
Just
wondering
Making

Now

my
room
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

How
was
dinner
?
[sskarz]
It
was
good
,
just
had
some
green
pasta
Everyone
was
already
in
the
rooms
so
I
just
sat
down
for
a
bit
and
decompressed
Have
you
had
dinner
?
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
nice
,
yea
I
did
,
they
only
had
beef
so
I
made
a
little
turkey
sandwich
that
was
kinda
gross
ngl
But
I
ate
what
I
could
[sskarz]
Ah
okay
,
tomorrow
it
’
ll
be
better
I
’
m
sure
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
hopefully
Have
you
figured
out
anything
else
about
the
situation
?
[sskarz]
Honestly
I
don
’
t
really
wanna
think
about
it
,
been
thinking
about
it
since
6
am
and
it
’
s
kinda
hurting
my
brain
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
that
’
s
okay
It
’
s
okay
love
,
don
’
t
think
about
it
.
How
was
your
class
today
?
[sskarz]
Trust
me
,
I
’
m
tapped
out
for
tonight
Uh
it
was
pretty
good
,
my
workflow
turned
out
to
be
worth
the
effort
last
night
as
I
breezed
through
with
notes
and
had
everything
connected
so
well
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
sorry
that
that
had
been
happening
lol
,
I
can
’
t
really
help
form
here
but
stay
safe

anything
about
it
,

me

me
anytime
I

someone
with
me
at
all
times
and

[prabipyakurel]
Literally

[sskarz]
They

gonna
do
anything
more
anyway

Haha

[prabipyakurel]
I

I
know
but
someone
that
can
go
that
far

you
don
’
t
know
what
else
they
can
be
planning
They
have
your
info
and

what
you
look
like
So
just
be
extra
cautious
[sskarz]
I
know
,
but
trust

ll

😘
Also
I
found
the
greatest
thing
ever
I
found
out
that
this
new
Notes
app
I
'
m
using
is
actually
amazing
!
As
I
write
down
my
notes
,
I
can
record
the
entire
lecture
and
that
recording
sticks
to
my
notes
for
that
day
specifically
,
and
it
'
s
like
my
notes
start
writing
themselves
as
the
recording
is
playing
some
incredible
stuff
,
never
seen
this
before
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
That
’
s
pretty
cool
And
useful
too
[sskarz]
yeah
,
so
I
recorded
my
last
lecture
for
today
and
it
wasn
'
t
even
a
big
file
size
,
it
'
s
stored
right
into
iCloud
and
it
'
s
only
attached
to
that
note
page
specifically
and
I
can
hear
the
lecture
guy
so
clearly
using
that
everyday
from
now
on
lol
👍
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
,
yea
that
seems
helpful
.
Technology
just
keeps
getting
better
and
better
lol
[sskarz]
that
'
s
why
i
love
tech
lol
anyways
,
hope
i
wasn
'
t
disturbing
u
from
hw
or
anything
like
that
whatcha
doin
?
[prabipyakurel]
You
really
weren
’
t
love
,
I
was
looking
for
things
to
do
😂
😂
I
just
changed
and
all
,
just
staring
at
the
ceiling
in
the
dark
Talking
to
you
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Nah

probably
exhausted
[sskarz]
mentally

out
that
'
s
good
,
i
love
boring
days
[prabipyakurel]
You
sleepy
?
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
But
the
problem
hits
when
you
can
’
t
find
anything
to
do
😭
Other
than
studying
something
But
eventually
that
is
finished
too
[sskarz]
omg
u
can
'
t
just
sit
still
and
be
bored
can
u
u
just
gotta
be
productive
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
gonna
be
honest
,
I
feel
so
god
damn
useless
if
I
don
’
t
get
anything
done
I
want
to
rest
something
and
just
sit
and
then
later
I
go
,

I
could
have
gotten
something
done
You

,
I
am
not
keeping
you

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I

while
And

And

for
my
classes
But

stare
at
YouTube

How
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
love
,
my
day
has
been
okay
.
I
got
up
and
check
my
midterm
grade
and
surprisingly
I
didn
’
t
fail
,
got
83
/
00
.
I
also
got
full
score
for
my
sociology
quiz
.
Then
I
attended
my
2
classes
and
found
out
that
for
my
philosophy
midterm
,
he
will
take
the
strongest
one
and
grade
it
so
I
am
praying
.
Then
I
ended
the
day
by
going
to
history
and
finishing
half
the
move
from
last
Thursday
.
I
also
went
to
go
eat
dinner
,
but
I
didn
’
t
like
anything
and
didn
’
t
really
feel
like
eating
it
so
I
had
a
few
onion
rings
and
pumpkin
pie
.
Now
I
am
sitting
and
not
doing
anything
,
and
looking
for
what
needs
to
be
done
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
oh
hey
that
'
s
good
,
you
will
be
okay
with
philosophy
I
know
.
Is
that
math
midterm
grade
the
raw
score
or
the
rounded
up
one
?
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
raw
is
83
/
100
[sskarz]

major
Mac
update
came
out
tonight
so
I
’
m
updating
that
rn
[prabipyakurel]
ah

[sskarz]
But
I
’
m
in
bed
waiting
for
a
call
that
I
’
ll
probably
never
get
😂
Wbu
love
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
wanted
to
calm
down
after
dinner
,
and
now
I
am
looking
for
something
to
do
I
got
2
papers
i
can
start
on
,
but
i
know
i
need
a
good
few
hours
once
i
start
working
on
it
so
cant
do
that
um
got
through
the
math
i
can
do
on
my
own
,
and
saving
the
rest
for
office
hours
tomorrow
um
i
would
finalize
my
schedule
but
i
still
need
to
work
on
the
time
stuff
I
dont
know
what
to
do
😭
[sskarz]
Hmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]
im
bored
,
but
i
can
do
something
rn
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
late
to
start
anything
rn
Are
u
that
type
where
if
u
start
something
new
u
try
and
finish
it
in
that
session
[prabipyakurel]
yea
as
much
as
i
can
'
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
makes
sense
[prabipyakurel]
once
i
go
,
i
will
keep
going
[sskarz]
So
rn
if
u
started
on
one
of
the
papers
,
you
would
probably
stay
up
all
night
to
get
it
done
tonight
[prabipyakurel]
i
would
stay
up
and
go
until
i
run
out
of
information
[sskarz]
I
see
,
yeah
honestly
u
have
tomorrow
morning
U
can
start
then
since
u
have
time
leeway
that
’
s
not
cutting
into
your
sleeping
time
[prabipyakurel]
for
sociology
i
need
books
and
can
only
use
what
i
have
gathered
from
the
previous
morning
,
and
for
history
,
I
need
to
review
the
files
and
find
out
where
each
document
is
I
mean
,
I
can
stay
up
,
i
dont
have
anything
early
tomorrow
[sskarz]
I
know
but
yk
you
should
at
least
try
and
get
some
good
sleep
Goes
a
long
way
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
love
I
know
[sskarz]
I
know
u
know
,
just
reminding
u
:)
But
if
you
think
you
can
and
if
it
’
s
worth
it
,
then
go
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
awww
you
are
so
sweet
[sskarz]
Who
am
I
to
stop
you
lol
[prabipyakurel]
my
boyfriend
,
my
everything
❤
️
[sskarz]
AWWWWW
you
’
re
so
AMAZING
I
LOVE
YOUUUUUU
❤
️
you
’
re
my
whole
world
🥰
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
dont
you
ever
question
"
who
am
I
"
to
me
okie
you
are
my
entire
world
sanskar
❤
️
keep
that
in
mind
[sskarz]
But
hey
,
in
the
face
of
determination
,
I
’
d
rather
you
do
it
than
not
and
feel
bad
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
thinking
about
it
at
most
I
will
create
an
outline
perhaps
because
the
essay
for
history
is
due
on
the
9th
and
sociology
on
16th
so
.
[sskarz]
Ok
wtf
u
have
so
much
time
hahaha
But
u
should
start
tho
,
don
’
t
wanna
do
things
last
minute
,
so
an
outline
would
be
perfect
[prabipyakurel]
exactly
and
when
I
am
bored
I
do
thing
ahead
of
time
instead
of
thinking
and
resting
lol
Mhm
[sskarz]
You
’
re
just
my
hard
working
girlfriend
and
I
love
you
so
much
for
that
;)
But
do
learn
to
take
breaks
once
in
a
while
okie
[prabipyakurel]
I
do
take
breaks
love
dw
thats
when
I
am
scrolling
to
see
what
i
have
to
do
those
are
my
breaks
[sskarz]
Ok
so
you
don
’
t
know
what
breaks
are
💀
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
hardworking
love
,
I
love
you

for
that
!
[sskarz]
I

one
day
if
we

re

a
date
and
we
’
re
not
doing
something
productive
,
i
better
not
see
u
pull
out
canvas
to
check
for
assignments
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
do
,
I
sometimes
go
on
youtube
and
insta
,
but
then
think
about
something
academic
and
then
I
will
close
the
youtube
and
everything
and
start
checking
on
assignments
or
emails
[sskarz]
Aaaaaaand

goes
haha
[prabipyakurel]

on
anyting
rn
?
[sskarz]
Okay

’
s

Try
not
to
buy
plane
ticket
to
San
Francisco
challenge
-
IMPOSSIBLE
!!
jk
jk
haha
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
thinking
about
writing
it
on
either
the
independence
or
the
communist
take
over
[sskarz]
This
for
history
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
this
is
for
sociology
[sskarz]
What
[prabipyakurel]
i
created
a
timeline
for
indonesia
[sskarz]
I
mean
I
guess
[prabipyakurel]
the
one
that
was
due
like
last
week
and
now
i
got
to
focus
on
one
event
[sskarz]
I
seeeee
Whatcha
leaning
towards
?
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhhh
what
do
you
seeeee
?
[sskarz]
U
,
I
’
m
staring
at
ur
pic
rn
and
smiling
:)
[prabipyakurel]
Probably
the
first
president
and
his
presidency
,
because
if
i
do
that
I
can
write
about
multiple
events
that
happened
under
his
rule
[sskarz]
Ohhhhh
smart
decision
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[sskarz]
How
long
does
the
paper
have
to
be
?
And
also
,
do
they
not
allow
u
to
use
online
resources
like
the
entire
web
,
just
books
?
[prabipyakurel]
5
-
7
double
spaced
,
preferred
books
and
not
random
websites
they
have
to
be
like
i
think
he
said
no
biases
and
focusing
on
a
specific
arguments
[sskarz]
Ah
so
an
objective
overview
of
events
basically
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[sskarz]
So
like
I
’
m
assuming
ur
gonna
use
books
to
cite
as
sources
[prabipyakurel]
basically
have
to
mention
the
event
,
what
happened
,
and
how
it
contributes
to
development
using
lecture
and
books
yep
gonna
sit
on
the
library
floor
between
the
shelves
again
[sskarz]
But
how
do
u
know
what
book
to
look
for
?
Like
is
there
a
section
on
George
Washington
biographies
?
[prabipyakurel]
I
search
it
up
on
the
university
library
website
,
it
tells
me
which
floor
and
what
section
number
its
located
in
and
i
go
find
it
I
am
pretty
sure
[sskarz]
Like
a
title
of
a
book
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
or
just
like
the
general
idea
of
it
so
i
type
on
indonesia
or
indonesian
history
and
it
shows
me
options
and
i
pick
some
record
the
number
and
which
library
it
is
in
and
then
go
[sskarz]
WAIT
HOLD
ON
THE
ROOMBA
CAME
IN
MY
ROOM
[prabipyakurel]
um
ok
[sskarz]
Sorry
about
that
,
I
freaked
out
That
thing
eats
my
wires
Anyways
Oh
okay
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
fr
?
[sskarz]
The
library
system
does
make
things
easier
No
yeah
,
I
’
m
deathly
scared
of
that
thing
coming
in
my
room
It
’
s
destroyed
3
of
my
wires
so
far
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
[sskarz]
And
one
time
it
got
stuck
under
my
bed
and
it
just
died
there
,
so
throughout
one
of
my
days
I
would
just
hear
it
say
ERROR
and
it
would
scare
the
shit
out
of
me
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Sorry
sorry
that
came
out
randomly
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
you
hear
that
like
midnight
yikes
[sskarz]
U
must
’
ve
read
that
like
wtf
is
this
man
on
😂
I
WOKE
UP
TO
IT
LIKE
THAT
💀
[prabipyakurel]
lol
dont
apologize
silly
You
on
nothing
dw
,
i
know
what
a
roomba
is
lol
it
was
really
random
though
[sskarz]
sorry
😅
I
typed
it
so
fast
I
forgot
to
actually
go
get
the
damn
roomba
and
put
it
back
outside
my
room
[prabipyakurel]
stop
apologizing
well
where
is
it
now
?
[sskarz]
I
put
it
back
in
it
’
s
charging
station
It
’
s
terror
has
stopped
temporarily
[prabipyakurel]
lol
it
cleans
for
you
leave
it
alone
let
the
thing
do
its
job
its
your
responsibility
to
move
stuff
when
its
cleaning
[sskarz]
But
the
problem
is
,
is
that
it
comes
into
my
room
when
I
’
m
asleep
and
just
slurps
all
my
wires
up
[prabipyakurel]
who
turns
the
thing
on
when
you
alseep
?
make
sure
its
off
before
you
sleep
then
[sskarz]
No
it
turns
on
automatically
at
a
specific
time
at
night
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
not
creepy
at
all
[sskarz]
yeah
i
'
d
rather
just
vacuum
my
room
myself
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
that
seems
easier
[sskarz]
that
way
im
aware
im
not
destroying
all
my
charging
cables
😂
[prabipyakurel]
when
we
clean
the
rooms
,
we
do
it
all
on
the
same
day
no
yea
but
make
sure
it
doesnt
mess
up
anyting
that
you
need
[sskarz]
no
yeah
same
oh
definitely
i
have
a
fight
with
that
thing
everyday
it
tries
to
come
in
my
room
i
swat
it
away
with
my
door
😂

[prabipyakurel]
No
there
is
something
about
him
He
is
friends
with
the
one
that
stares
at
me
So
his
math
lecture
is
after
mines
right
but
since
the
first
time
I
met
him
at
office
hours
he
came
to
the
lecture
that
I
attend
with
my
friend
and
I
.
And
him
and
that
one
that
stares
,
they
sit
in
the
bottom
row
and
me
and
my
friend
sit
right
above
them
.
And
Monday
,
we
went
sat
down
,
and
then
he
turned
to
the
back
,
smiled
until
I
smiled
back
and
said
“
hi
…
prabi
.
And
I
was
like
hi
.
I
also
ran
into
him
after
dinner
and
didn
’
t
recognize
him
without
glasses
,
and
then
he
said
“
oh
hey
”
and
then
I
was
like
oh

s

.
😂
[sskarz]
"

Also

after

I
came
to
the
dorm
and
my
roommates
were
here
and
I
kneeled
down
to
put
my
shoes
away
and
got
up
and
my
legs
just
gave
up
and
I
just
tripped
over
myself
💀
It
was
hilarious
My
roommate
was
like

over

[sskarz]

😂
[prabipyakurel]
No

the
whole
time
[prabipyakurel]
No

I
was
laughing
at
myself
Literally
the
clumsiest
person
to
be
around
Lol

this
morning

[sskarz]
im
gonna
have
to
get
my
reaction
speed
to
be

[prabipyakurel]
You

Imma

[sskarz]
is
this
a
challenge
?
imma
hold
ur
hand
all
the
time
so
u
can
'
t
fall
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
still
manage
to
fall
And
take
you
down
with
me
[sskarz]
eh
it
could
be
worse
,
if
im
on
the
ground
then
at
least
im
there
with
you
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
nooooo
But
like
if
there
is
a
bump
on
the
road
and
I
am
talking
and
looking
up
,
I
will
trip
on
it
and
either
fall
or
fly
forward
and
look
like
a
fool
[sskarz]
at
this
point
i
'
m
just
gonna
carry
you
on
my
shoulders
so
u
can
'
t
actually
trip
anywhere
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwwww
lol
if
you
can
that
is
Imagine
you
trip
lol
[sskarz]
oh

broad
shoulders
so
u
can
rest
easy
[prabipyakurel]
Okay

[sskarz]

near
as
clumsy
as
you
😂
[prabipyakurel]
We
shall
see
Sometimes
is
on
me
because
I
be
walking
without
looking
But
sometimes
it
’
s
just
the
way
the
road
is
built
that
I
just
stumble
[sskarz]
There
’
s
no
way
ur
blaming
the
road
😂
😂
Love
all
u
need
to
do
is
have
peripheral
vision
of
the
walking
area
in
front
of
you
[prabipyakurel]
That
yea
I
need
to
do
[sskarz]
U

staring
at
the
sky
while
u
walk
?
💀
[prabipyakurel]
But

car
situation
that
is
on
them
I
be
looking
everywhere
but
the
way
I
am
walking

Oh
no
yeah

s

reckless

They

close
sometimes
I
am
like
,
I
’
m
sorry
,
do
you
not
see
a
crosswalk
here
It
’
s
because
it
’
s
a
crosswalk
with
no
blinking
lights
or
nothing
so
they
have
to
see
you
to
stop
[sskarz]
Omg
is
it
so
much
harder
to
see
a
real
human
than
blinking
lights
,
these
drivers
are
some
idiots
[prabipyakurel]
They
fr
are
[sskarz]

sky
It

s
just

I
am
on
campus
or
on
sidewalks
I
don
’
t
look
ahead
of
me
[sskarz]

able
to

been
working
on
some
stuff
how
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
my
day
was
good
,
I
started
off
this
morning
got
a
little
bit
of
everything
done
.
Then
after
lunch
I
went
to
math
office
hours
and
cleared
up
my
confusion
about
certain
topics
.
But
like
today
idk
after
like
30
mins
in
there
I
felt
really
drowsy
and
needed
to
put
my
head
down
for
a
little
,
and
i
usually
stay
the
full
office
hours
and
go
straight
to
math
from
there
,
but
I
couldnt
today
and
came
down
to
the
library
for
a
short
15
min
nap
before
my
math
lecture
.
Then
after
I
got
back
,
i
still
felt
like
so
sleepy
and
all
,
it
has
never
happened
before
and
i
slept
from
like
5
-
6
and
went
for
dinner
,
which
was
decent
.
And
I
have
been
working
on
the
preparation
for
my
history
essay
and
am
taking
notes
on
the
document
that
I
need
to
write
about
.
How
about
you
?
No
need
to
ever
apologize
love
.
[sskarz]
oh
okay
,
you
still
feeling
sleepy
?
my
day
has
been
going
pretty
well
,
english
was
boring
as
usual
,
lunch
was
great
but
made
me
sleepy
too
,
lots
of
math
today
and
then
a
boring
class
to
end
off
on
.
Found
out
there
was
like
this
studyathon
at
a
room
so
my
friends
and
I
went
there
and
chilled
out
,
they
had
free
food
and
coffee
which
i
so
desperately
needed
.
Didn
'
t
do
much
studying
tho
,
just
talked
about
classes
and
stuff
with
my
friends
i
haven
'
t
seen
in
a
while
.
It
was
pretty
good
,
then
afterwards
i
walked
to
where
i
usually
parked
,
except
i
didn
'
t
park
there
for
that
time
,
so
i
walked
across
campus
like
twice
because
im
dumb
.
Came
home
then
got
some
work
from
my
dad
to
do
,
then
now
I
'
m

[sskarz]

I
did
sleep
well
for
the
most
part
I
just
had
a
really
wacky
dream
wbu
love
?
[prabipyakurel]
dw
I
slept
well
,
i
had
no
dream
,
woke
straight
in
the
morning
what
was
it
?
[sskarz]
This
dream
was
like
super
vivid
idk
why
.
So
it
was
like
I
was
part
of
this
horror
maze
with
some
friends
,
and
I
was
in
the
lead
of
everyone
.
And
so
everyone
was
having
trouble
navigating
but
I
just
went
ahead
and
I
lost
them
by
going
too
far
,
and
I
found
this
door
that
had
a
label
called
"
Secret
"
with
like
that
classic
blood
horror
type
lettering
.
I
went
inside
and
it
was
just
like
a
room
that
looked
like
a
regular
old
apartment
,
with
like
a
kitchen
and
dinner
table
and
everything
.
It
looked
super
normal
,
till
I
kept
going
in
the
room
where
I
noticed
things
started
repeating
itself
like
the
dining
room
would
repeat
itself
as
I
kept
moving
into
the
room
,
and
the
kitchen
would
start
duplicating
itself
as
I
kept
moving
.
So
much
so
that
there
were
5
identical
fridges
,
and
I
checked
in
each
of
them
and
they
were
all
the
same
.
I
know
,
but
it
gets
weirder
.
As
I
checked
the
last
fridge
,
I
heard
a
random
ass
noise
.
Now
I
hadn
'
t
heard
anything
till
then
,
and
so
I
looked
at
the
fridge
with
a
closer
eye
and
noticed
there
was
like
a
small
dog
in
a
cage
at
the
bottom
of
the
freezer
in
the
fridge
.
So
I
picked
up
the
dog
in
the
cage
and
I
was
like
wtf
,
so
I
went
to
go
back
to
where
I
came
from
,
and
for
some
reason
there
'
s
just
a
bunch
of
the
same
dogs
,
but
not
in
cages
,
all
in
a
pile
.
And
they
all
just
stared
at
me
,
and
the
one
I
had
started
growling
at
me
,
so
I
threw
it
at
the
other
dogs
and
ran
for
my
life
to
the
door
where
I
came
from
.
And
then
a
dog
got
on
my
leg
and
started
biting
me
and
wouldn
'
t
let
go
,
but
I
punted
it
and
then
I
shut
the
door
behind
me
.
I
just
kept
running
and
then
I
woke
up
You
know
,
people
say
there
are
meanings
behind
every
dream
,
idk
about
that
one
😂
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
certainly
weird
,
and
dog
biting
is
kinda
scary
but
you
will
be
fine
[sskarz]
no
yeah
,
i
know
what
the
dog
looks
like
i
just
don
'
t
know
the
breed
name
but
its
like
a
small
white
dog
[prabipyakurel]
ohhh
[sskarz]
IT
WAS
THIS
EXCEPT
NOT
CUTE
AT
ALL
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
[sskarz]
AND
THEY
ALL
BARED
THEIR
TEETH
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
ugh
[sskarz]
yeah
just
imagine
like
a
thousand
of
these
little
shits
and
they
all
started
chasing
me
[prabipyakurel]
what
the
hell
were
you
thinking
picking
up
one
of
them
i
would
have
ran
the
instant
[sskarz]
well
why
is
there
a
dog
in
a
cage
at
the
bottom
of
a
freezer
like
what
💀
[prabipyakurel]
a
trap
love
dont
fall
for
it
[sskarz]
mhmmm
but
yeah
,
thats
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
next
time
dont
leave
your
friends
behind
,
even
in
a
dream
,
and
go
into
a
door
that
says
secret
😂
[sskarz]
it
explains
why
my
rem
sleep
was
longer
than
usual
lol
well
damn
im
like
those
dumb
horror
characters
that
go
towards
the
danger
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
dumb
dreams
just
happen
sometimes
[sskarz]
ive
had
weirder
so
its
fine
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhhh
no
i
have
done
the
weirdest
things
because
of
a
dream
i
thought
was
real
[sskarz]
really
?
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
this
one
time
i
thought
we
were
doing
laundry
,
so
i
took
off
all
my
sheets
and
my
dirty
clothes
put
them
into
the
pile
and
was
ready
to
do
laundry
AT
LIKE
2
IN
THE
MORNING
😂
then
i
realized
it
was
a
dream
and
i
was
like
oh
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
is
hilarious
i
can
definitely
imagine
u
doing
that
even
not
in
a
dream
😂
😂
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
and
then
i
put
the
sheets
on
in
the
dark
because
i
didnt
want
to
wake
anyone
up
,
and
i
realized
that
i
put
it
on
backwards
,
so
in
the
morning
my
dad
was
like
,
why
is
the
sheet
put
on
that
way
and
then
i
explained
and
omg
they
were
like
laughing
and
i
was
like
bruh
[sskarz]

dummy
hahaha
[prabipyakurel]
yea
now
i
dont
sleep
walk
as
much
but
i
still
wake
up
like
shocked
sometimes
because
my
body
does
that
fake
fall
things
and
i
am
just

?
that
is
wild
[prabipyakurel]

this
is
some
of
the
stuff
I
'
m
learning
in
my
class
rn
its
a
high
level
class
talking
about
functional
programming
and
one
of
the
languages
that
follows
that
is
ML
we
don
'
t
learn
ML
over
here
,
we
learn
something
called
Haskell
interesting
tho
anywhoooo
u
don
'
t
need
to
know
what

of
that
means
😂
[prabipyakurel]

Tuesday
[prabipyakurel]
oh

[sskarz]
helping
my
dad
mount
a
TV
,
and
then
it
fell
,
and
then
realized
the
mounting
stuff
was
super
bad
,
and
then
we
fixed
it
took
a
LOT
longer
than
expected
[prabipyakurel]
it
fell
?
[sskarz]
then
got
caught
up
in
a
business
meeting
that
lasted
forever
[prabipyakurel]
oh
i
see
[sskarz]
yeah
,
my
dad
pulled
on
it
and
it
literally
unhooked
and
fell
in
his
hands
💀
gave
me
a
heart
attack
[prabipyakurel]
love
,
were
you
the
one
that
attached
the
thing
on
the
wall
?
[sskarz]
...

trying
to

😂
[prabipyakurel]

...
[sskarz]
uhh
huhhhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
but
i
am
glad
its
up
and
glad
no
one
got
hurt
[sskarz]
guilty
as
charged
😂
hahaha
ur
so
adorable
no
it
was
my
dad
it
runs
in
the
family
😂
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
okie
okie
[sskarz]
but
yeah
got
that
sorted
[prabipyakurel]
you
just
resting
rn
?
[sskarz]
yeah
,
just
in
a
call
with
some
friends
for
background
noise
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
nice
nice
[sskarz]
sorting
out
my
financials
as
this
new
laptop
costs
even
more
😭
[prabipyakurel]
oh
no
,
you
will
be
fine
love
dw
[sskarz]
i
mean
yeah
its
just
i
hate
seeing
the
number
go
down
😂
literally
like
i
was
trying
to
put
up
a
workload
that
i
'
m
doing
for
a
project
,
and
it
almost
ran
out
of
RAM
at
16
gigs
its
just
not
enough
anymore
so
I
went
with
a
higher
end
model
with
32
gigs
of
RAM
now
that
i
'
m
saying
this
,
i
forgot
to
ask
,
do
u
know
what
RAM
is
?
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
an
idea
its
like
just
how
much
the
computer
can
hold
and
stuff
right
i
might
be
wrong
like
how
much
storage
perhaps
[sskarz]
you
'
re
kinda
right
ish
so
think
of
it
like
this
your
RAM
is
your
short
term
memory
stuff
like

Are

[sskarz]
Nah
,
but
wanna
see
something
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[sskarz]
Dang
it
,
I
missed
my
chance
Bear
was
barking
at
me
because
his
ball
went
under
the
sofa
and
he
wanted
me
to
get
it
for
him
😂
[prabipyakurel]
quick
throw
it
back
under
there
😂
lol
no
no
dont
[sskarz]
Okay
just
cleaned
up
his
throw
up
He
just
doesn
’
t
learn
[prabipyakurel]
oh
no
,
is
he
okay
?
[sskarz]
He
’
s
been
eating
bees
all
day
today
,
not
surprising
He
’
s
okay
just
a
bit
dumb
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
and
those
bees
keep
coming
back
too
[sskarz]
Yeah
[prabipyakurel]
eventually
dude
will
learn
his
lesson
[sskarz]
You
would
think
so
😂
Oh
love
I
do
wish
he
would
learn
too
This
is
his
3rd
time
,
maybe
4th
time
is
the
charm
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
you
can
pretend
to
go
eat
a
bee
and
pretend
to
drop
dead
and
he
will
think
that
they
arent
edible
💀
idk
if
that
would
work
lol
[sskarz]
Love
,
I
enjoy
your
enthusiastic
solution
❤
️
But

😂
[prabipyakurel]

eating
me
😂

the
ball
on
the
side
of
the
food
bowl
,
takes
one
bite
then

get
the
ball
😂
Then

LONG

time

I
had
such
a
weird
dream
I
was
dreaming
that
I
worked
for
this
one
tech
YouTuber
and
I
was
like
some
kind
of
techy
person
on
the
team
,
and
I
talked
to
the
YouTuber
and
he
was
like
telling
me
all
these
things
and
then
it
liked
zoomed
all
out
and
then
I
saw
that
entire
conversation
in
a
YouTube
video
Having
some
weird
inception
levels
of
dreams
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
That
’
s
pretty
interesting
You

upload
videos
on
YouTube
?
[sskarz]
Nope
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
why
not
[sskarz]
Uh
Yk
that
’
s
a
good
question
I
liked
the
idea
of
being
a
YouTuber
,
just
I
don
’
t
have
the
consistency
Also
idk
if
I
’
d
have
time
for
all
that
lol
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

I

’
t
put
too
much
stress
in
yourself
,

it
when

[prabipyakurel]
My
day
has
been
normal
,
I
got
some
more
of
both
essays
done
in
the
morning
,
went
to
math
office
hours
and
reviewed
some
math
concepts
,
and
attended
my
math
lecture
where
he
moved
way
to
fast
.
Then
got
back
and
ate
some
chow
mein
that
I
had
saved
from
yesterday
.
I
got
started
and
finished
half
my
math
hw
,
and
then
went
to
eat
dinner
.
After
dinner
,
I
got
another
paragraph
of
the
history
essay
done
,
and
now
I
am
thinking
if
I
should
just
call
it
a
day
or
get
more
done
for
the
sociology
one
(
i
have
like
2
weeks
till
its
due
).
currently
just
listening
to
music
and
thinking
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
Sounds
like
a
good
day
,
you
’
ve
got
time
on
the
sociology
paper
and
it
’
s
already
kind
of
late
👍
Knowing
u
tho
,
u
might
get
too
bored
and
start
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
been
quite
the
day
,
a
long
one
really
.
I
started
off
by
waking
up
late
at
like
8
and
then
went
to
UPS
to
get
a
box
to
return
my
laptop
.
Then
got
my
sister
some
Starbucks
for
the
morning
since
she
didn
’
t
have
work
,
and
then
went
to
class
.
Boring
as
usual
,
but
then
I
got
a
text
saying
that
my
laptop
came
early
and
that
I
could
go
pick
it
up
so
I
did
.
Got
it
,
then
got
some
really
good
lunch
,
then
headed
back
to
my
next
class
.
It
was
okay
,
content
was
heavy
and
the
lecture
was
recorded
so
I
’
m
gonna
go
back
and
watch
that
later
this
week
.
The
next
class
after
was
boring
,
got
a
midterm
in
2
weeks
for
that
class
so
yippeee
.
Then
my
final
class
,
got
a
big
assignment
due
this
coming
Sunday
,
and
another
mention
of
a
midterm
coming
soon
.
Then
I
talked
with
some
of
my
friends
and
then
headed
home
.
And
now
I
’
m
here
,
family
went
out
to
Cheesecake
Factory
and
they
said
they
’
re
bringing
some
food
back
so
I
’
m
waiting
for
that
.
That
’
s
all
!
👍
Oh
and
a
friend
from
**
7
years
ago
**
randomly
contacted
me
today
,
which
was
weird
but
eh
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
okay
long
day
there
.
I
know
you
will
do
great
on
those
midterms
love
,
you
got
this
!
❤
️
Its
always
exciting
waiting
for
food
tho
lol
👍
Is
it
like
a
good
friend
of
yours
?
[sskarz]
Awww
thank
you
love
,
I
’
ve
got
loads
of
studying
to
do
so
I
’
m
gonna
turn
into
a
hermit
for
the
next
2
weeks
and
just
study
👍
Uh
,
more
like
I
knew
them
,
we
’
re
friends
for
8th
grade
,
then
completely
dropped
when
we
went
to
highschool
.
They
went
to
SG
so
yeah
[prabipyakurel]
You
will
do
awesome
,
remember
to
take
breaks
in
between
as
always
and
rest
.
Their
name
?
[sskarz]
Idk
if
u
know
her
,
but
she
goes
by
Audrey
Yu
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
name
is
too
common
dont
know
her
[sskarz]
Yeah
makes
sense
She
was
friends
with
a
group
of
people
I
didn
’
t
really
hangout
with
,
so
we
didn
’
t
keep
in
contact
in
high
school
And
then
I
just
got
a
random
follow
,
then
a
message
on
my
story
about
my
new
laptop
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
thats
good
tho
,
they
probably
wanted
to
catch
up
with
you
[sskarz]
I
guess
..?
I
’
m
gonna
be
straight
honest
with
you
,
I
don
’
t
really
like
to
continue
friendships
after
years
of
not
talking
at
all
,
especially
if
I
had
no
desire
to
stay
friends
even
after
drifting
apart
yk
?
it
all
seems
so
sudden
,
and
i
don
'
t
like
it
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
get
that
feeling
,
it
happens
.
Yea
if
you
dont
feel
confortable
love
,
its
okay
.
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
so
I
left
her
on
read
😋
[prabipyakurel]
damn
aw
no
[sskarz]
trust
me
[prabipyakurel]
were
you
like
close
friends
with
her
?
[sskarz]
this
has
happened
a
couple
times
now
[prabipyakurel]
oh
[sskarz]
not
really
usually
when
people
do
this
to
me
,
they
'
re
looking
for
something
from
me
so
its
like
,
eh
shoo
away
as
harsh
as
that
sounds
[prabipyakurel]
oh
,
yea
then
you
are
okay
no
it
makes
sense
[sskarz]
i
can
be
a
very
cold
hearted
person
lol
its
just
things
like
that
i
don
'
t
really
like
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
its
normal
love
,
i
mean
8
years
is
a
LOT
[sskarz]
yeah
no
fr
literally
0
contact
from
then
to
now
and
just
out
of
the
blue
like
cmon
now
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
that
after
8th
grade
some
of
my
closest
friends
I
had
no
connection
with
because
i
had
no
form
of
social
media
,
and
after
getting
discord
,
I
got
each
of
their
requests
little
by
little
,
but
yea
if
its
really
random
after
8
years
,
idk
about
that
either
[sskarz]
i
mean
she
knew
my
discord
,
if
she
ever
wanted
to
reach
out
in
that
time
frame
she
could
have
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
[sskarz]
brb
,
family
home
[prabipyakurel]
yea

little
sus

[sskarz]
yup
i
just
deleted
the

i
'
ll
go
after

,
when
i
don
'
t
want

i
'
ll
leave
it
there
and
never
pick
it
back
up
again
yk
?
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

dance
team
here

her
[sskarz]
ohhh

[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
love
,
that
’
s
completely
normal
,
there
was
a
big
gap
and
it
’
s
not
easy
to
just
pick
it
up
like
that
.
And
she
could
have
contacted
you
earlier
so
.
[sskarz]
exactly
also
she
has
ties
to
some
people
i
absolutely
detest
and
i
'
d
like
to
keep
that
connection
severed
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
yea
then
maybe

[prabipyakurel]
Swaer
😂
😂
[sskarz]
I
could
'
ve
bought
a
lottery
ticket
that
day
and
probably
won
the
lotto
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
adorableeeeeeeeeee
,
maybe
Try
it
next
year
on
the
same
day
😂
[sskarz]
hahaha
for
sure
omg
is
it
just
my
parents
,
or
like
once
a
year
,
my
parents
will
get
super
excited
and
will
just
buy
a
single
lotto
ticket
,
and
then
inevitably
either
get
nothing
or
scream
that
they
got
$
5
back
and
then
it
repeats
the
next
year
😂
[prabipyakurel]
My
god
,
I
thought
that
was
only
my
parents
😂
They
get
overly
excited
for
like
a
week
in
the
entire
year
And
after
that
they
just
don
’
t
care
[sskarz]
hahaha
omg
nepali
parents
are
all
just
the
same
😂
omg
yeah
😂
its
like
nothing
happened
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
the
most
is
like
oh
wow
“
2
dollars
”
And
when
they
don
’
t
win
anything
they
always
go
,
just
so
close
,
I
was
so
close
to
those
numbers
😂
[sskarz]
OMG
YEAH
💀
😂
my
mom
got
so
sad
one
day
,
she
actually
got
somewhat
close
to
the
jackpot
by
a
couple
numbers
and
then
she
got
like
nothing
😂
[prabipyakurel]
It
happens
and
I
am
there
just
like
Yes
I
think
everyone
gets
close
to
the
numbers
but
doesn
’
t
get
the
exact
number
I
be
like
“
it
’
s
why
it
’
s
a
lottery
”
[sskarz]
yup
i
don
'
t
really
like
those
things
,
so
i
like
watching
other
people
do
it
haha
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
no
yea
my
mom
does
the
same
thing
she
makes
a
sad
face
and
just
moves
on
Yea
never
gave
those
things
a
thought
I
feel
like
if
something
good
has
to
happen
,
don
’
t
force
it
,
it
should
naturally
just
happen
.
[sskarz]
yeah

[sskarz]
i
'
m
always
setting
up
love
hahaha
jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
😂
Okay
[sskarz]
no
i
know
it
feels
like
i
'
ve
been
doing
it
for
hours
now
and
truthfully
,
on
a
brand
new
machine
and
my
developer
needs
with
how
much
i
have
to
download
and
literally
setup
,
it
takes
a
while
are
u
sleepy
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
Just
laying
down
and
resting
[sskarz]
u
should
try
and
sleep
it
'
ll
help
your
headache
go
away
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
Omg
I
found
out
that
in
the
math
building
in
the
classroom
the
chairs
have
wheels
Idk
if
you
have
seen
those
chairs
[sskarz]
choirs
?
yeah
i
'
ve
seen
those
haha
nah
im
jk
i
have
seen
chairs
with
wheels
mhmmm
what
about
them
?
[prabipyakurel]
Shut
the
hell
up
Like
these
They
looks
so
cool
,
now
I
wanna
a
class
with
these
[sskarz]
oh
i
have
these
in
like
every
classroom
[prabipyakurel]
Bruh
[sskarz]
they
are
pretty
nice
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
have
any
classroom
classes
😭
[sskarz]
imagineeee
,
that
'
s
all
i
have
😂
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhh
I
always
walk
past
classrooms
and
go
,
damn
,
I
wanna
sit
and
swivel
around
But
no
I
get
a
lecture
hall
where
I
barely
have
enough
space
to
stretch
my
arms
properly
without
knowing
someone
in
the
face
with
my
elbow
[sskarz]
wow
its
that
packed
always
?
[prabipyakurel]
Well
for
math
,
the
place
I
sit
yes
because
I
sit
in
the
front
,
and
for
my
other
lectures
yes
the
seats
are
pretty
close
Occasionally
there
are
empty
seats
next
to
me
but
only
on
one
side
[sskarz]
oh
damn
i
guess
that
makes
sense
,
you
guys
have
so
many
students
and
for
a
single
class
it
has
to
be
a
huge
lecture
hall
just
to
fit
everyone
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
350
students
for
math
I
was
dying
when
he
said
that
[sskarz]
holy
shit
u
gotta
send
me
a
pic
of
that
lecture
hall
that
'
s
insane
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
one
day
So
my
lecture
has
350
and
the
next
math
lecture
,
same
subject
different
group
,
also
has
about
300
[sskarz]
that
'
s
crazy
and
im
out
here
with
max
class
size
of
50
💀
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
will
take
a
pic
of
all
my
lecture
halls
Some
are
spaced
out
better
then
others
tho
Some
have
a
better
writing
surface
while
some
are
worse
[sskarz]
yeah
that
makes
sense
do
you
prefer
classrooms
like
high
school
or
lecture
halls
?
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
my
math
discussion
probably
Personally
high
school
style
but
this
is
fine
too
it
works
I
don
’
t
completely
hate
it
[sskarz]
yeah
you
probably
have
to
just
get
used
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
Hey
love
,
I
feel
a
little
sleepy
and
I
think
I
just
need
to
put
my
head

am
going
to
go
to
sleep
.
I
love
you

much
,

Did

[prabipyakurel]
Hey

,
I

,
dream
wasn
’
t
the
best
but
I
slept
well
.
How

[sskarz]
Hey
what
was
your
dream
about
?
I
slept
well
,
no
dreams
at
all
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
got
really
scared
around
like
4
-
5
So
basically
I
was
walking
to
the
dorm
apparently
past
like
7
,
and
these
group
of
boys
noticed
me
and
they
would
not
stop
chasing
me
,
there
was
no
one
else
on
the
streets
and
when
I
got
to
my
building
they
caught
up
to
me
and
then
I
woke
up
[sskarz]
Oh
my
god
that
’
s
terrifying
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
up
really
scared
and
like
for
a
second
wanted
to
just
cry
But
I
calmed
myself
down
,
listened
to
one
of
your
voice
messages
and
then
just
slept
again
❤
️
[sskarz]
No
no
don
’
t
cry
okay
,
you
’
re
okay
it
’
s
just
a
dream
love
,
you
are
gonna
be
fine
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
know
,
it
just
felt
so
real
for
a
little
[sskarz]
I
know
,
that
must
’
ve
felt
terrible
,
I
’
m
sorry
that
you
had
to
experience
that
you
’
ll
be
okay
love
,
no
one
is
coming
after
you
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
don
’
t
say
sorry
love
it
’
s
okay
Yea
and
at
that
time
I
realized
I
have
classes
until
6
:
30
and
by
the
time
I
get
to
my
dorm
it
’
s
almost
7
so
it
scared
me
even
more
[sskarz]
Hey
,
it
was
just
a
dream
okay
.
Dreams
mean
nothing
,
you
’
ll
be
safe

[prabipyakurel]
How
was
your
day
love
?
[sskarz]
eh
its
been
okay
went
to
the
gym
early
in
the
morning
for
an
hour
,
but
i
had
to
stop
because
my
body
just
felt
so
weak
for
no
reason
,
and
then
when
i
walked
out
of
the
gym
,
everything
was
extraordinarily
bright
like
the
sun
had
crashed
on
me
,
and
then
i
drove
home
and
i
felt
way
too
weak
to
do
anything
for
some
reason
,
so
i
had
lunch
and
had
a
mid
day
nap
for
like
2
hours
.
Afterwards
,
I
felt
a
lot
better
.
Then
I
went
to
class
and
then
worked
on
some
homework
and
studying
.
Came
home
,
fed
bear
,
and
I
'
m

No

to
,
so
i
took
off
my
glasses
for
a
bit
and
worked
and
now
its
gone
my
day
was
kind
of
busy
,
so
started
off
with
sociology
,
then
went
to
philosophy
(
it
was
so
boring
i
was
dying
in
there
),
after
that
I
went
to
office
hours
which
was
at
like
1
:
15
,
then
came
to
eat
lunch
real
fast
,
came
back
to
the
room
and
checked
for
assignments
and
revised
the
essay
.
After
that
I
had
a
zoom
math
session
from
3
:
30
-
5
:
00
,
but
I
left
the
meeting
10
mins
early
to
get
to
my
history
lecture
which
was
useful
.
I
got
more
info
for
my
essay
.
Pretty
much
after
that
I
had
dinner
,
and
have
been
working
on
editing
and
finding
essay
information
.

day
But

?
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
we
can
watch
them
together
some
day
[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
amazing
:
)
❤
️
[sskarz]
So
my
first
dream
was
weird
,
well
the
other
one
was
weirder
but
here
we
go
.
I
was
wearing
a
suit
and
it
started
off
me
being
in
an
elevator
and
reaching
a
floor
,
and
it
was
this
fancy
room
with
gold
and
diamonds
and
stuff
,
and
a
table
where
there
was
a
guy
sitting
there
.
So
i
go
over
to
this
guy
and
apparently
i
also
had
body
guards
and
some
other
guys
with
me
,
and
when
I
approached
the
guy
near
the
table
,
he
sets
this
like
tech
device
and
tells
me
i
have
10
minutes
to
fiddle
with
it
,
and
then
i
have
to
tell
him
about
the
product
.
And
it
’
s
a
familiar
looking
product
,
but
also
not
at
all
.
It
looked
like
a
Nintendo
switch
but
it
was
like
of
the
future
?
So
the
guy
leaves
and
then
i
start
inspecting
the
thing
and
i
make
note
about
what
was
good
and
bad
about
it
for
literally
like
10
mins
.
It
felt
super
long
till
he
came
back
,
and
he
said
give
me
a
percent
score
,
i
said
60
%
and
everyone
was
shocked
and
the
guy
was
like
,
why
?
So
then
I
start
speaking
out
of
my
ass
like
I
know
any
of
this
weird
holographic
tech
stuff
and
he
nods
and
says
,
so
for
20
million
would
you
want
the
patent
?
I
say
yes
for
some
reason
,
then
we
shook
hands
and
then
the
dream
ended
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
look
at
you
in
a
suit
with
bodyguards
and
all
😂
That
sounds
cool
tho
[sskarz]
It
was
so
vivid
but
weird
idk
[prabipyakurel]
Random
,
but
hey
maybe
that
will
be
you
in
the
future
[sskarz]
And
then
i
woke
up
at
like
3
:
40
am
😂
lol
idk
about
20
million
dollar
deals
but
we
will
see
Also
Sleep
graph
checks
out
,
i
had
3
REM
cycles
,
2
of
those
i
remember
weird
dreams
for
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
this
next
dream
was
just
like
…
what
So
it
starts
in
this
car
and
I
’
m
driving
with
some
of
my
friends
and
we
park
at
this
like
old
abandoned
house
.
We
were
gonna
setup
and
spend
the
night
here
for
some
reason
I
’
ve
got
no
clue
.
We
start
getting
setup
and
then
some
time
passes
.
Then
gunshots
start
happening
and
we
all
rush
down
and
start
shooting
them
back
?
I
was
confused
but
i
grabbed
the
nearest
gun
and
I
start
shooting
them
,
but
then
my
friend
gets
shot
and
then
he
literally
almost
dies
.
So
then
,
as
best
as
I
could
explain
it
,
time
reverses
and
the
dream
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
when
we
were
parking
,
but
i
remember
what
happened
last
time
.
So
I
decided
to
warn
them
this
time
that
we
were
gonna
be
ambushed
and
that
my
friend
would
die
,
so
then
we
prepare
for
it
and
the
thing
happens
again
like
Deja
vu
.
This
time
tho
,
no
one
gets
hurt
,
and
then
we
all
celebrate
.
But
somehow
someway
i
got
shot
and
it
shocked
me
and
then
i
woke
up
and
i
actually
had
a
sharp
pain
in
my
stomach
for
a
very
brief
moment
Anyways
,
that
was
it
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
your
stomach
doesn
’
t
hurt
rn
though
right
?
You
okay
?
[sskarz]
No
no
it
was
just
when
i
woke
up
For
like
3
seconds
And
then
it
faded
completely
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
so
weird
Dream
was
a
little
odd
[sskarz]
Yeah
idk
it
always
ends
with
me
being
shot
😂
Both
of
those
were
insanely
vivid
in
memory
[prabipyakurel]
Where
did
you
get
shot
?
[sskarz]
Guessing
the
stomach
?
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[sskarz]
But
I
’
m
okay
dw
love
Dreams
are
wacky
U
up
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
know
who
shot
you
?
[sskarz]
Nope
My
friend
said
I
got
shot
,
i
look
down
,
i
woke
up
and
pain
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
But

are
okay

That
’
s
scary
[sskarz]
Yeah

’
m

happen
?
[prabipyakurel]
No

just
I
don
’
t
have
the
energy
in
me
to
do
much
this

my
headaches
start
at
random
times
and
like
I
feel
so
drowsy
often

Idk
it
’
s
only
Wednesday
and
usually
I
don
’
t
feel
this
way
[sskarz]
Hey
are
you
eating
enough
?
And
drinking
enough
water
?
Usually
a
deficiency
in
one
of
those
leads
to
that
kind
of
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
Eating
is
fine
love
I
eat
a
lot
trust
me
Water
might
be
it
,

I
have
been
drinking

drink
a
little
more
consciously

Some
weeks

yourself
in
check

7
-

[sskarz]
Well
I

to
my
English

,
then
from
there
had
lunch
and
worked
on
some
homework
,
then
went
to
my
next
2
classes
and
then
came
home
.
I
got
super
motivated
so
I
decided
to
basically
redo
everything
and
get
everything
in
life
in
order
,
so
I
redid
my
entire
resume
and
worked
on
fleshing
out
my
LinkedIn
(
since
I
got
hacked
and
someone
deleted
all
of
my
history
stuff
),
then
worked
on
more
homework
,
then
had
to
pick
up
a
dai
(
same
one
from
the
day
I
was
gonna
ask
u
to
be
mine
at
your
house
)
and
then
came
home
,
refined
my
essay
,
and
worked
on
my
new
project
But
I
can
’
t
do
anymore
or
I
’
m
gonna
lose
too
much
energy
for
