Yea
like
2
days
ago
we
had
our
first
4th
of
july
in
South
El
Monte
,
and
it
was
pretty
good
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
watch
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
I
didn
’
t
get
to
see
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
passed
out
that
day
😵
‍
💫
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
happens
,
and
you
are
in
college
,
I
can
'
t
blame
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
is
everything
else
going
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
going
pretty
well
!
Started
teaching
another
class
and
it
’
s
been
pretty
smooth
so
that
’
s
where
all
my
attention
has
gone
to
for
the
summer
.
How
about
you
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
,
you
are
a
brilliant
person
so
I
am
sure
you
are
the
best
teacher
out
there
.
I
am
doing
alright
,
it
has
been
a
mixture
of
stress
and
happiness
as
sometimes
I
feel
like
everything
is
going
to
be
okay
while
other
times
I
just
think
about
all
the
things
that
can
go
wrong
.
But
overall
,
yea
it
has
been
kind
of
weird
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Brilliant
is
more
you
haha
,
but
I
appreciate
the
compliment
.
I
’
m
guessing
you
’
re
stressed
from
the
move
to
Berkeley
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aw
,
thank
you
.
Oh
my
god
,
yes
this
is
the
first
time
I
will
be
away
from
home
,
like
7
hours
type
of
away
and
when
I
think
about
it
it
makes
me
really
sad
.
I
am
going
to
miss
like
everyone
.
We
have
just
been
buying
stuff
to
take
over
there
and
figuring
out
how
I
am
going
to
manage
over
there
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
it
can
be
scary
to
be
out
so
far
away
for
a
while
.
To
be
honest
I
haven
’
t
experienced
that
myself
so
I
can
’
t
speak
so
much
.
But
hey
it
’
s
going
to
be
a
fun
experience
!
If
you
ever
need
help
with
preparing
mindset
and
actual
stuff
to
move
,
no
one
knows
better
than
my
sister
so
try
contacting
her
if
you
ever
feel
a
little
lost
.
Knowing
you
though
,
I
know
you
’
ll
be
more
than
fine
!
💯
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You

any
plans
to
celebrate

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

at
ease
after
a
few
months
there

but
I
will

a
while

Your

movie
later

then
go
to

,
that
is
if
the
fireworks
stop
and
I
can
actually
get
some
sleep
.

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

or
the

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

😴
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hello
again
,
sorry
if
you
were
busy
,
um
do
you
know
this
person
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
just
wondering
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
why
do
you
ask
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
on
mutual
friends
it
shows
that
person
too
,
so
i
was
just
curious
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
uh
let
me
search
them
up
,
maybe
i
have
history
but
i
don
'
t
remember
this
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
apparently
i
did
invite
this
person
to
some
server
back
in
2020
,
but
to
be
honest
i
can
'
t
remember
who
this
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
are
also
mutual
friends
with
a
professor
I
know
in
Mark
Keppel
,
so
my
guess
is
maybe
I
shared
a
class
with
this
person
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
i
see
,
yea
he
is
a
keppel
student
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
would
make
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
yea
thanks
I
was
just
looking
around
and
saw
that
in
common
so
I
asked
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
no
worries
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
How
'
d
you
sleep
last
night
btw
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
after
most
of
the
big
ones
were
done
,
the
person
down
my
street
started
again
,
so
it
was
another
hour
after
that
.
I
honestly
don
'
t
know
when
I
fell
asleep
yesterday
to
be
honest
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
kept
waking
up
to
the
sound
of
**
BANG
**
in
the
distance
like
6
times
over
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
that
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
just
gonna
pray
that
they
all
finished
their
fireworks
last
night
and
no
more
from
now
on
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yes
,
I
need
sleep
and
i
didnt
quite
get
that
yesterday
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
the
sky
is
so
foggy
and
smells
toxic
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
be
careful
,
the
air
quality
is
really
really
bad
right
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
got
a
warning
on
my
phone
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
its
crazy
.
Apparently
around
SoCal
there
were
a
lot
of
illegal
fireworks
happening
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
happens
every
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
people
usually
buy
the
fireworks
through
"
gray
market
"
means
and
its
cheaper
that
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
trying
to
sleep
yesterday
and
was
wondering
how
much
these
people
must
have
spent
on
fireworks
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
you
try
and
get
it
legally
its
crazy
crazy
expensive
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
50
dollars
for
a
sizeable
boom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
pretty
fun
yesterday
until
we
were
tired
and
wanted
to
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
we
usually
have
our
windows
open
because
of
the
heat
,
and
yesterday
I
was
like
"
um
no
"
and
closed
those
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
your
room
was
probably
heating
like
an
oven
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
so
hot
around
the
house
plus
the
smoke
and
noise
outside
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
ozone
layer
taking
a
major
hit
every
year
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
we
are
going
to
die

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
talking
with
my
parents
about
roller
coasters
and
on
the
news
was
this
one
story
about
roller
coaster
malfunction
and
I
got
lectured
on
how
unsafe
it
is
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OH
!
was
it
that
headline
where
like
a
big
screw
was
missing
on
a
ride
and
it
had
to
be
put
taken
down
temporarily
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
saw
that
somewhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeahhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
like
that
happens
rarely
and
i
think
i
am
fine
taking
that
chance
,
its
worth
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
a
super
rare
case
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
like
saying
,
"

'
t
get
on
airplanes
cuz
its
a
lethal
crash
",
like
if

not
a
Nepal
domestic
airplane

completely
fine

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

seems
pretty
safe
aside
from
nepal
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
I
counted
the
hot

hot
wheel
orange
tracks
that
you

customize
to
put
in
loops
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

you
are
still
missing
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
advisor
everytime
I
visit
her
:
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
keeping
track
of
these
units
gets
so
unnecessarily
complicated
for
no
reason
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
and
going
into
high
school
with
no
middle
school
experience
,
jeez
I
thought
that
was
hard
and
then
college
classes
hit
and
I
was
like
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
know
,
personally
I
love
college
way
more
than
I
ever
did
with
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
people
keep
telling
me
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
are
like
on
more
time
,
freedom
and
fun
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
love
the
fact
that
I
get
to
choose
my
own
schedule
and
I
'
m
not
in
a
box
for
8
hours
continuously
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
some
very
specific
people
are
like
,
"
no
you
are
going
to
die
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
think
thats
cool
tho
,
like
more
choices
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
think
it
may
be
because
if
you
don
'
t
have
good
time
management
skills
,
then
its
really
hard
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
can
see
it
from
that
perspective
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
thats
what
I
was
thinking
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
as
long
as
you
'
re
on
top
of
your
assignments
and
study
relatively
well

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm

how

the
theory
of
relativity

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

took
a
massive
hit

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🤔
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
I
saw
on
the
news
yesterday
that
they
found
cocaine
in
the
white
house
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

happening
these
days
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
that
submarine
incident
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
was
a
crazy
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🤯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
right
,
I
dont
know
personally
why
I
would
spend
so
much
money
to
look
at
a
wrecked
ship
,
but
people
got
goals
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
like
social
media
was
full
of
like
trolls
explaining
what
incident
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
people
got
money
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
are
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
I
think
I
'
d
understand
more
if
you
got
to
see
the
titanic
with
your
own
eyes
,
but
then
again
they
were
going
to
look
through
a
tiny
glass
hole
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
also
that
ship
was
just
extremely
poorly
built
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
they
took
that
thing
for
another
trip
knowing
there
was
a
malfunction
and
a
defect
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
took
the
lives
of
like
6
people
for
no
reason
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
especially
bad
for
that
19
year
old
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
wish
he
wasn
'
t
on
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
he
was
just
starting
life
,
was
your
age
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
makes
me
sad
:
sadge
:
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
no
you
can
go
first
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
would
you
ever
go
shark
cage
diving
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
HELL
NO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ok
listen
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
like
the
one
thing
that
I
would
back
out
from
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
all
for
dangerous
things
trust
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
the
ocean
,
and
then
sharks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
both
those
things
are
like
things
I
'
m
not
too
much
a
fan
of
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
cant
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
cant
swim
so
if
by
any
cance
the
cage
breaks
and
I
have
to
swim
up
by
myself
I
might
as
well
just
stop
trying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
yeah
that
'
s
just
certain
death
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
I
would
just
die
from
shock
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
a
shark
was
just
attacking
my
cage
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
could
swim
out
but
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
you
are
lucky
you
might
be
able
to
escape
I
guess
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
I
would
rather
jump
without
a
bungee
rope
from
a
cliff
than
doing
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
can
survive
technically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
hit
the
trees
and
branches
to
break
your
fall
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yes
exactly
,
but
the
shark
thing
,
no
chance
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
also
all
of
your
bones
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
mean
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
well
there
is
that
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ok
to
really
break
it
down
:
[sskarz]
100
%
chance
of
death
from
a
hungry
hungry
shark
[sskarz]
or
90
%
chance
of
death
from
a
tall
fall
or
10
%
to
survive
but
be
paralyzed
like
everywhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
think
at
that
point
im
taking
the
shark
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
second
choice
thank
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
there
was
a
story
of
how
a
guy
survived
a
fall
from
an
airplane
thousands
of
feet
in
the
air
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
also
comething
about
lage
bodies
of
water
that
doesnt
sit
well
with
me
'
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
people
get
real
lucky
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
you
know
the
person
I
was
asking
about
a
while
back
,
wheater
you
knew
that
person
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
so
funny
story
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
barely
getting
used
to
discord
and
i
had
taken
a
cloud
computing
class
from
ELAC
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
this
persons
name
is
Kaiden
Hong
and
it
was
a
boy
but
the
entire
time
we
spent
4
months
sharing
answers
and
all
,
I
thought
it
was
a
girl
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
the
name
was
gender
neutral
and
during
final
exam
we
were
comparing
answers
and
it
was
taking
too
long
and
he
was
like
can
i
just
call
and
we
can
screen
share
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
now
I
still
think
this
is
a
girl
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
he
called
and
then
I
picked
up
and
said
hi
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
the
deep
voice
was
like
"
hi
"
and
I
was
dead
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
actually
hilarious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
I
know
that
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
laughing
so
much
I
had
to
mute
and
close
video
and
text
him
that
I
was
gonna
get
water
real
quick
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hold
on
I
have
to
check
my
instagram
,
I
think
I
have
him
followed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
like
I
felt
so
dumb
for
just
assuming
he
was
a
girl
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
the
profile
picture
was
like
an
anime
girl
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
that
'
s
how
they
get
ya
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
KNOW
HOW
I
KNOW
THIS
PERSONNNNNNN
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
basically
back
in
my
keppel
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
used
to
run
a
"
Gaming
Club
"
and
we
had
like
250
+
members
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
I
was
the
VP
and
I
used
to
run
stuff
like
events
and
meetings
and
what
not
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
I
think
this
person
was
a
class
below
me
,
like
probably
sophomore
or
freshman
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
that
was
most
of
our
roster
for
the
club
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OHHHHH
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
I
think
that
was
one
of
the
people
that
signed
up
and
wanted
to
be
in
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
my
chat
history
is
referring
to
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
just
a
dumb
experience
that
I
thought
would
be
funny
to
share
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
pretty
funny
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ever
since
then
when
I
get
someones
discord
and
dont
know
their
gender
I
dont
assume
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
good
rule
of
thumb
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
have
a
friend
that
is
a
guy
,
but
he
has
like
a
thin
figure
and
long
hair
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
this
one
time
,
we
were
walking
out
of
the
AMC
theaters
from
watching
the
new
spiderman
movie
and
so
we
both
go
to
the
mens
restroom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
as
I
was
washing
my
hands
,
and
my
friend
is
walking
out
,
these
2
kids
stare
at
him
and
say
,
"
you
know
this
is
the
mens
restroom
right
?"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
right
then
,
I
just
had
to
pause
and
look
at
them
for
a
second
,
but
then
I
finally
realized
and
I
just
started
laughing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
friend
didn
'
t
take
any
offense
but
it
was
hilarious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
yea
sometimes
I
look
at
people
with
long
hair
and
go
,
so
..
are
you
a
dude
or
a
gal
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
do
like
to
ask
for
clarity
these
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mistook
a
girl
for
a
dude
before
and
had
to
wait
for
the
teacher
to
say
her
for
me
to
find
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
the
feeling
when
you
'
re
talking
to
a
new
person
and
they
say
their
name
but
you
don
'
t
catch
it
then
,
so
you
have
to
wait
till
someone
else
says
their
name
to
figure
it
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
if
that
'
s
just
me
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
this
happens
a
lot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
no
its
not
just
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
thought
it
was
just
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
definitely
not
,
I
feel
like
my
hearing
is
just
terrible
so
it
happens
sometimes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
gonna
go
eat
some
lunch
,
I
'
m
starving

good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
some
uncultured
people
out
there
think
fruit
doesnt
belong
on
pizza
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
fr
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
some
of
them
are
actually
pretty
good
on
pizza
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
but
like
olives
and
mushrooms
are
gross
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
everything
else
is
fine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
I
have
finally
found
someone
that
shares
the
same
views
as
me
about
mushrooms
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
everyone
in
my
family
loves
mushrooms
except
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
same
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
cant
even
like
put
it
in
my
mouth
,
it
makes
me
sick
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
maybe
its
because
as
a
child
i
thought
all
mushrooms
were
toxic
but
like
even
after
trying
to
so
many
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
texture
is
just
nasty
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
ikr
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
sameeee
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
what
are
your
thoughts
on
eggplants
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
’
re
aight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
I
won
’
t
go
out
of
my
way
for
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
if
its
on
there
then
I
’
m
just
“
eh
”
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
cant
handle
eating
those
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
definitely
see
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
think
mushrooms
,
olives
,
and
eggplants
are
the
most
disgusting
things
on
the
planet
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
definitely
isn
’
t
anywhere
near
my
favorite
or
I
would
even
choose
it
out
of
any
other
option
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
’
s
fair
tbh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
olives
to
me
just
have
no
taste
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
meh
yea
,
if
they
are
chopped
up
real
good
and
put
in
something
they
dont
matter
to
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
if
the
are
like
those
whole
ones
or
sliced
,
i
just
cant
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
to
remove
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ok
but
how
about
the
opposite
spectrum
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
favorite
foods
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Nepali
food
or
any
kind
of
food

any
culture

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

100
percent
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

home
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
if
I
told
u
this
but
when
I
was
on
my
trip
with
my
sister
,

got
sick
of
French
food

a
Nepali
restaurant
and
got
thakali
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
comfort
food
tbh

my
family

on
our
way
to
china
town
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

there
if
you
ever
get
a
chance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
small
*
obviously
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
for
sure
,
yea
sushi
is
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
lots
of
really
good
food
and
they
got
an
arcade
there
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
do
you
like
dried
seaweed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
mom
loves
those
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
tastes
alright
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
imo
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
everyone
likes
those
,
but
I
dont
like
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
if
it
is
with
something
I
like
it
,
but
just
that
dry
thing
alone
tastes
wierd
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
some
people
swear
by
it
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
I
have
a
friend
,
she
will
literally
prefer
dried
seaweed
over
any
kind
of
chips
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yes
there
are
those
people
who
sit
with
just
that
for
lunch
and
are
like
its
my
lunch
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
how
they
do
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
its
because
we
arent
used
to
it
eating
something
like
that
for
lunch
all
the
time
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
tru
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
like
my
parents
are
like
rice
rice
rice
that
is
the
only
thing
to
fill
you
and
not
make
you
sick
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
i
mean
they
aren
'
t
wrong
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
rice
has
a
lot
of
carbs
so
it
makes
you
full
pretty
quick
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea

there

no
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

the
kind
of
person
where
like
if
i
order
something
a
few
days
before
,
that
'
s
the
only
thing
that
i
think
of
till
i
get
that
delivery
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
have
no
idea
why
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
its
alright
,
if
there
is
my
money
involved
in
something
I
would
stress
over
it
as
well
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
I
'
m
building
a
new
computer
from

just
grinding
my
teeth
hoping
my
parts
don
'
t
come
damaged
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
sounds
cool
,
i
love
putting
things
together
and
working
with
like
wires
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
😮
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

m
finally
getting
the
chance
to
customize
my
own
workstation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
been
waiting
to
do
this
for
like
7
years
now
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
there
was
this
time
in
physics
where
we
had
wires
and
batteries
to
make
the
bulb
light
up
and
i
kept
doing
things
that
I
wasnt
supposed
to
and
the
bulb
just
stopped
working
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
honeslty

it
looks
once
its
done
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
YESSSSSSS
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

so
cool
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
you
should
be
,
that
is
something
to
loook
forward
to
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
the
whole
reason
I
got
into
where
I
am
today
is
because
I
asked
my
dad
if
I
could
build
one
when
I
was
12
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
like
7
years
later
I
can
finally
do
it
since
I
saved
up
enough
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
you
have
been
so
brilliant
since
you
were
a
kid
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
u
at
5
years
old
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
no
I
'
m
just
a
very
curious
person
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
always
have
been
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
curiosity
is
like
the
drive
of
my
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
awesome
,
you
must
be
like
ahead
all
your
peers
in
college
too
huh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
you
had
that
background
knowledge
of
comp
sci
before
starting
your
major
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
only
in
career
wise
I
would
say
but
even
then
,
there
'
s
a
lot
of
people
in
my
classes
that
are
BRILLIANT
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
'
m
just
in
awe
every
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
what
happens
when
passion
turns
into
career
I
guess
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
yea

just
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
want
to
become
a
lawyer
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yes
sir
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
what
made
you
wanna
become
a
lawyer
out
of
curiosity
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
um
when
I
was
like
in
5th
grade
or
sixth
grade
we
had
to
make
presentations
about
careers
and
I
think
I
chose
lawyer
/
attoney
because
I
knew
what
it
was
but
was
curious
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
the
more
I
researched
the
more
I
learned
and
since
there
is
research
and
writing
involved
and
communications
,
i
was
like
okay
this
is
what
I
am
good
at
and
will
love
to
do
everyday
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
I
kind
of
want
to
help
people
with
the
problems
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Your
honor
,
my
lawyer
is
ballin
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
really
awesome
though
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
love
arguing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
that
is
also
something
😂

DEBATE
CLASSSSSSSSSSSS
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
one
of
my
favorite
classes
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
i
realized
instead
of
acadec
i
should
have
joined
speecha
nd
debate
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
made
a
mistake
of
now
switching
early
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
hopefully
I
can
take
a
similar
class
at
berkeley
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
acadec
gave
you
good
work
ethic
tho
I
imagine
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
being
in
that
club
made
me
realize
just
how
much
more
work
you
had
to
manage
back
in
keppel
😵
‍
💫
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
taught
me
how
to
condense
large
amounts
of
info
into
parts
that
i
can
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
keppel
was
just
keppel
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
that
school
made
me
feel
dumb
everytime
I
walked
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
were
in
acadec
too
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
just
for
a
year
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
...
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
had
more
work
from
acadec
than
any
of
my
6
classes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
thats
how
I
felt
freshmen
year
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
for
the
1st
week
or
so
I
was
like
"
why
did
I
do
this
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
the
teacher
was
nice
and
got
used
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
because
of
acadec
I
know
2
people
at
berkeley
so
there
is
that
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ayy
nice
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
you
got
some
familiar
faces
already
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hopefully
that
makes
the
transition
easier
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
does
,
its
crazy
,
they
are
both
majoring
in
astro
-
physics
which
sounds
painful
just
by
the
names
of
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
my
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
salute

🫡
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

enough
brainpower
to
do
anything
physics
related
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
took
physics
1
and
absolutely
hated
every
second
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
damn
I
love
the

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
took
regular
physics
and
loved
the
experiments
but
hated
the
math
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
math
is
deadly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the

kitchen
devouring
them
.
My
day
was
pretty
chill
I
had
a
talk
with
my
advisor
in
the
morning
and
basically
just
followed
up
on
emails
and
things
throughout
the
day
.
I
cleaned
my
room
and
just
watched
TV
.
Not
too
boring

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
context
,
bear
was
just
being
really
sad
tonight
and
my
sister
and
I
had
to
basically
give
therapy
and
treats
to
convince
him
to
go
outside
to
go
pee
and
poop
and
what
not
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
he
is
very
emotional
so
it
took
a
VERY
long
time
to
convince
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hey
that
'
s
pretty
good
speed
,
do
you
know
how
to
type
qwerty
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Again
nothing
against
you
,
sorry
I
didn
'
t
get
to
you
,
hopefully
you
didn
'
t
think
anything
otherwise
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Your
dog

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

up
after
a
couple
treats
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

What
is
QWERTY
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
'
s
like
a
typing
style
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
’
s
alright
,
I
thought
you
just
stopped
responding
and
I
was
like
oh
shoot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
’
s
fine
Kay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
some
people
call
it
"
proper
typing
"
but
tbh
whatever
is
comfortable
to
a
person
is
their
own
typing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
dw
I
don
'
t
like
leaving
people
on
read
,
I
find
it
weird
personally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
usually
respond
within
a
20
minute
time
unless
I
am
doing
something
that
takes
more
attention
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
if
that
helps
you
in
any
way
but
yeah
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yea
I
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
’
s
alright
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
assuming
you
typing
speed
is
higher
than
average
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
btw
I
found
the
movie
you
were
talking
about
earlier
on
youtube
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
but
its
slowed
down
over
the
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
trained
me
in
middle
school
for
2
years
to
type
in
QWERTY
and
my
highest
ever
was
146
Words
Per
Minute
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

trailer

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanna
experience
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
When
I
become
an
attorney
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

recent
news

something
like
this

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

DRAMAAAAAA
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
search
up
the
court
cases
with
the
most
tea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
like
a
kid
in
a
candy
store
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
time
do

11
:
30pm
if
I
want
to
stay
up
,
if
not
then
like
around
10
:
00pm
if
I
want
to
wake
up
super
early
to

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
hope
I

m
not
keeping
you
awake
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

no
,
this
whole
summer
thing

me
awake
until

1
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Dw
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
gotcha
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
just
tossing
and
turning
in
bed
,
because
my
brain
is
telling
me
to
go
to
sleep
but
I
literally
can
’
t
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
should
just
slowly
close
your
eyes
,
take
a
deep
breath
,
and
then
😴
💤
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
do

go
to
sleep
easily
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Usually
when
I
have
a
long
day
and
am
tired
yes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
haven
’
t
done
much
,
I
like
to
watch
something
or
do
something
to
get
me
tired
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
okay
so
pretty
normal
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
say
that
because
a
lot
of
my
friends
suffer
from
insomnia
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
not
suffering
from
insomnia

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
guess
that
'
s
not
a
bad
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
as
long
as
you
don
'
t
build
a
tolerance
to
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
can
be
a
bad
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
pretty
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Don

t

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh

I
never
take
sleeping
pills
ever
unless
I
get
sick
or
some
extraordinary
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
me
neither
,
usually
when
I
am
sick
I
fall
asleep
easier
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
know
if
that
is
only
me
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
sleep
with
a
stuffy
nose
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ooo

suck
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
hate
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
would
suffocate
if
I
tried
to
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
with
that
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I
need
to
clear
my
nose
before
bed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
like
not
being
able
to
breathe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Then
I
have
to
like
get
up
midway
and
breathe
properly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhm
mhm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yep
exactly
why
I
use
sleeping
pills
for
that
occassion
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Do

nightmares
when
u

?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hmmmmm

often
than
not
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
don
'
t
usually
get
nightmares
,
but
if
I
do
,
then
I
wake
up
in
a
cold
sweat
and
its
like
lucid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
sometimes
I
like
just
freak
out
and
wake
up
thinking
someone
is
watching
me
but
there
is
like
nothing
there
.
And
other
times
I
wake
up
because
my
body
does
that
fake
fall
thing
in
bed
.
Don
’
t
know
if
that
has
ever
happened
to
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
I
know
that
feeling
far
too
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
fake
fall
thingy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
’
s
weird
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
random
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
can
only
lucid
dream
nightmares
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
swear
those
feel
way
too
real
compared
to
every
other
dream
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
can
you
lucid
dream
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lucid
dreams
is
kind
of
rare
for
me
,
I
have
experienced
it
like
once
or
twice
where
I
am
like
I
know
I
am
in
a
dream
but
won
’
t
wake
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Kinda
creepy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
happens
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
wait
are
you
maybe
talking
about
sleep
paralysis
👀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wait
no
sleep
paralysis
happens
when
you
wake
up
...
i
think
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Sleep
paralysis
is
when
you
can
’
t
move
knowing
that
you
are
in
a
dream
and
need
to
wake
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Something

I
can
clearly
visualize
that
their
bathroom
had
blue
and
white
tiles
and
I
said
that
last
time
they
called
and
they
were
like
“
oh

”.

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

it
sometimes
auto
corrects
into
a
whole
another
word
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

autocorrect
can
be
a
nightmare

I
need

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

my
mom
whenever
she
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
used
to
back
when
I
was
a
kid
but

not
near
that
frequency
nowadays
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol

long
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
all
i
do
when
I
am
too
lazy
to
indulge
myself
in
anything
new
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
no
it
happens
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
SO

rn
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

came
back
home
from
the
gym
like
20
mins
ago
and
took
a
shower
so

I
’
m
about
to
figure
that

now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
everything
is
kind
of
in
the
air
rn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
days
I
have
to
really
think
about
what
I
can
do
for
the
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
some
days
I
am
like
"
how
am
i
gonna
get
everything
done
today
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
especially
during
summer
time
,
gotten
so
used
to
just
doing
assignments
and
studying
hard
for
the
past
couple
months
and
now
I
’
m
like
,
hmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
RIGHT
,
I
feel
like
I
did
nothing
productive
and
feel
useless
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
i
swear
like
everyday
in
the
summer
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeahhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Actually
I
was
feeling
like
that
a
lot
a
week
ago
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
so
I
’
m
trying
something
new
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
teach
little
kids
too
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yup
,
and
I
’
m
secretary
for
the
biggest
club
in
CSULA
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
hey
congrats
!!!!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
usually
I
would
be
swarmed
with
work
but
they
went
easy
on
me
this
week
😅
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Thanks
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
it
’
s
just
a
slow
week
,
im
sure
they
will
give
me
like
20
million
tasks
and
meetings
next
week
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
prepare
yourself
over
the
weekend
I
guess
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ughhhhhhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
which
club
is
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
called
ACM
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Associates
for
Computing
Machinery
I
believe
is
what
it
stands
for
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
help
students
land
internships
and
we
host
lots
and
lots
of
events
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
went
snooping
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
wanted
to
have
some
leadership
on
the
resume
so
I
decided
to
run
for
secretary
and
won
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Haha
yup
there
we
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
found
it
,
thats
pretty
cool
,
i
had
a
guess
it
would
be
something
technical
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
I
saw
this
that
one
time
I
visited
Cal
State
LA
for
on
the
spot
admissions
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yup
you
know
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
yeah
it
’
s
a
pretty
good
chance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
a
national
club
but
we
host
just
one
part
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
might
have
an
ACM
at
Berkeley
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
my
first
time
,
they
invited
me
and
told
me
they
would
tell
me
if
I
got
in
there
and
my
dad
dropped
me
off
and
went
to
work
thinking
it
was
going
to
take
a
while
and
it
took
me
30
min
to
go
around
to
find
where
they
were
doing
the
thing
.
Then
I
called
him
and
he
was
kinda
mad
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
will
check
on
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ahhh
your
dad
definitely
wasn
’
t
expecting
it
to
be
done
so
soon
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Are
you
thinking
of
joining
any
clubs
first
year
at
Berkeley
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
he
was
okay
imma
drop
you
off
at
the
parking
lot
,
just
done
get
kidnapped
and
tell
me
when
you
are
done
,
he
had
just
got
to
work
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
havent
found
any
yet
,
but
maybe
campus
ambassaors
(
the
ones
the
give
school
tours
)
or
residential
hall
assistants
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Other
than
that
I
will
probably
see
what
clubs
they
have
at
orientation
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
definitely
should
!
It
’
s
really
easy
to
meet
new
people
and
make
some
friends
in
your
major
circle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

One
of
the
best
things
about
college
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Is
having
that
fresh
start
mentality
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Maybe
that
’
s
why
I
like
college
more
tbh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
ever
have
those
peers
in
highschool
you
really
didn
’
t
like
being
around
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
was
forced
to
since
it
’
s
a
high
school
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
✅
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
that
never
exists
in
college
and
it
’
s
amazing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
some
very
specific
ones
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Same
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
there
was
this
one
girl
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
in
english
we
would
have
like
seminar
about
a
book
,
and
we
would
sit
in
a
big
circle
and
talk
and
ask
questions
,
but
our
teacher
always
told
us
if
we
shared
like
twice
to
step
out
and
give
others
a
chance
.
But
this
one
girl
would
like
answer
the
question
and
would
take
30
minutes
.
Dude
and
she
was
in
my
AP
lit
and
AP
lang
class
,
I
would
like
hate
her
,
I
got
an
F
because
I
didn
'
t
get
a
chance
to
speak
.
I
was
like
donw
with
her
,
I
wanted
to
seriously
go
up
to
her
and
be
like
"
shut
up
dammit
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
fr
wanted
to
to
do
this
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Wtf
that
’
s
insane
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
As
a
teacher
how
do
you
not
stop
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
basically
talking
for
more
than
twice
length
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😭
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
the
teacher
did
,
thats
the
wierd
part
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
she
would
go
on
and
on
,
and
it
doesnt
even
become
relevant
,
its
like
she
is
giving
a
summary
of
the
book
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
yea
I
understand
when
you
say
we
were
forced
to
be
around
people
in
high
school
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
way
I
would
’
ve
started
coughing
increasingly
louder
as
she
would
continue
on
the
seminar
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
to
piss
her
off
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
mean
how
is
that
fair
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
people
were
doing
that
,
there
were
peolpe
making
like
eye
contacts
to
each
other
and
rolling
their
eyes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
dude
my
friend
donny
was
sitting
next
to
me
and
he
just
would
not
stop
laughing
,
he
was
like
"
well
at
least
we
dont
have
to
speak
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
wanted
to
give
up
on
life
at
that
moment
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
brother
in
Christ
my
grade
depends
on
this
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ik
omg
i
was
explaining
how
this
will
negatively
impact
out
grades
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
our
god
damn
finals
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
speak
twice
to
get
full
points
and
ask
a
question
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
WTF
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
OH
NAH
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
would
NEVER
let
her
speak
for
that
long
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😤
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
after
she
was
done
someone
immediately
jumped
in
and
started
talking
so
me
and
my
friend
decided
to
ask
an
easy
question
and
answered
each
other
'
s
questions
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
She
had
the
audacity
to
leave
class
and
tell
me
the
seminar
was
so
good
at
the
lunch
line
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Like
from
a
scale
of
1

[sskarz]
the
thing
was
,
the
build
itself
wasn
'
t
that
difficult
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
the
fact
that
i

made
one
crucial
hindsight
that
caused
the
entire
thing
to
take
way
longer
than
it
should
'
ve
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

relatable
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
forgetting
my
screwdriving
kit
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
took
us
an
extra
5
HOURS
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
did
you
not
have
it
at
home
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
just
to
do
that

because
I
was
chasing
wild
geese
to
put
it
short
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
in
the
end
,
we
went
to
best
buy
and
bought
a
kit
,
only
for
my
dad
to
call
me
later
that
night
to
tell
me
where
it
actually
was
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
the
thing
was
,
you
might
be
thinking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
actually
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
"
oh

stupid
why
didn
'
t
you
call
him
sooner
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Let
me
guess
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
U
forgot
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

Greece
for
them
,
so
I
didn
'
t
want
to
call
them
during
the
middle
of
the
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
honestly
not
too
far
off
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
It
was
quite
messy
tho
[prabipyakurel]

funny
to
keep
in
mind
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
do
you
not
feel
well
or
is
it
because
you
have
too
much
energy
and
don
’
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
like
at
this
time
normally
i
would
usually
be
woozy
and
be
in
bed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
rn
,
i
could
legitamtely
go
workout
for
a
good
3
hours
type
of
energy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
a

idea

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Until

downstairs
and
he
was
sleeping
peacefully
so
i
don
'
t
want
to
disturb
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
might
have

just
do
some
pushups
or
something
,
cuz
its
looking
like
i
might
need

nyquill
or

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww

Why

t

something
warm
like

[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
that
will
make
you
fall
asleep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
day

…
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
In
like
the
5th
grade
,
we
had
brought
snacks
since
it
was
the
last
week
of
school
and
back
then
I
didn
’
t
now
like
dc
or
marvel
other
than
Superman
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
my
teacher
had
put
on
the
justice
league
,
and
I
was
sitting
with
3
boys
(
all
nerds
that
were
into
that
thing
)
and
there
was
this
thing
about
aqua
man
and
he
came
out
of
the
the
water
,
and
I
turned
around
to
my
table
and
asked
“
is
that
thanos
?”.
Food
was
thrown
and
words
were
said
.
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
AINT

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
:
O
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

my
friend
Donny

the
table
and
said
,
“

,
thanks

bald
and
purple
,
aqua
man
had
long
hair
and
tattoos
”
and
I
was
still
confused
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
brother
put
those
on
and
I
was
supposed
to
watch
it
and
I
fell
asleep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
can
’
t
believe
that
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
I
watched
when
they
ran
together
and
I
was
out
the
next
second
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
when
they
came
out
of
the
portals
to
fight
together
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
was
probably
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Life

scene
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ahhh
I
see
I
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Speaking
of
horror
movies
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
saw
that
a
new
paranormal
activity
is
coming
out
soon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
👀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
have
you
watched
those
movies
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
so
the
general
premise
is
basically
haunted
structures
,
but
you
view
the
story
through
like
video
cameras
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oooo
video
cameras
are
sooo
fun
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
pretty
cool
and
it
scared
me
hard
when
I
was
a
little
kid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
sooo
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
mean
when
we
were
little
ghosts
were
the
things
our
parents
told
us
to
scare
us
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
There
are
scenes
in
those
movies
where
it
’
ll
just
be
a
still
shot
of
a
hallway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Taken
by
a
video
camera
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
like
30
seconds
straight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
something
very
very
*
subtle
*
happens
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
the
build
up
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
creepy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Relatable
and
you
have
to
like
squint
to
find
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeahhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Have

Netflix

Cecil
hotel

[sskarz]
hold
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

taking
a
while
because
i
have
to
sign
into
netflix
and
i
forgot
the
password
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so

me
a
moment
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It

s
ok
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

this
one
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
yes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ok
imma
put
this
on
my
watchlist
,
actually
sounds
really
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
based
on
true
story
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
best
kind
of
stories
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
i
just
love
documentaries
in
general
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
there
are
crazy
thing
happening
around
the
world
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
documentaries
are
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ok
so
this
might
be
a
dumb
question
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
do
you
believe
in
ghosts
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
no
,
well
I
feel
like
people
that
have
gone
away
show
signs
but
not
in
like
a
👻
way
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
I
choose
not
to
believe
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
the
way
it
shows
on
horror
movies
at
least
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
have
had
my
handful
of
cases
of
"
ghost
"
like
encounters
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
does
it
ever
scare
you
to
walk
downstairs
after
everyone
is
asleep
or
be
able
in
the
house
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
I
just
gaslight
myself
into
thinking
it
was
by
some
physical
causae
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
nah
not
really
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
really
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
super
weird
cases
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
recently
or
like
a
while
back
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
actually
funny
story
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
not
so
funny
for
me
because
it
was
really
really
weird
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
kind
of
creepy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yesterday
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
it
’
s
okay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
back
when
my
friends
and
i
were
working
on
the
computer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
brought
the
computer
back
upstairs
to
work
on
it
,
and
thats
when
it
all
booted
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
imagine
this
,
it
was
like
around
2
am
and
we
were
so
tired
,
they
were
going
to
go
drive
back
home
and
i
had
to
clean
downstairs
.
When
we
all
started
creeping
downstairs
silently
(
because
we
didn
'
t
want
to
disturb
my
sister
or
make
any
noise
),
we
heard
a
noise
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
we
all
stopped
dead
in
our
tracks
on
the
stairs
down
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
feeling
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
it
came
from
the
kitchen
,
so
i
thought
someone
had
come
into
our
house
or
break
in
or
something
crazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Probably
pulled
out
your
dog
huh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
i
had
to
go
tip
toe
my
way
to
the
living
room
which
connected
to
the
kitchen
in
the
same
room
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
all
of
a
sudden
,
i
hear
a
bhajan
playing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
out
of
nowhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
starts
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
turn
back
and
i
see
my
friends
behind
me
like
super
confused
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
mind
you
its
completely
dark
down
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
apparently
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
for
literally
0
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
Alexa
got
started
by
something
,
and
started
playing
a
bhajan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
now
you
might
be
thinking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
"
that
'
s
probably
a
scheduled
event
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lmao
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
on
the
alexa
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
which
NO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
who
the
hell
is
going
to
do
puja
in
the
middle
of
the
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
ghosts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Jk
jk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
checked
in
the
app
,
no
where
there
did
it
say
to
start
playing
a
bhajan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
…
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
friends
just
started
saying
like
,
"
oh
nah
god
playing
with
us
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
so
they
quickly
left
,
i
turned
on
the
lights
,
and
nothing
had
changed
in
the
room
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
super
super
weird
and
creepy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
started
creeped
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
didn
’
t
you
turn
on
the
lights
on
your
way
down
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
then
we
all
started
laughing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
we
thought
someone
broke
in
and
needed
to
check
*
stealthily
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
just
made
scary
noises
and
scared
people
even
more
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

are
my
worst
nightmare
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
way
i
would
'
ve
just
fell
down
the
stairs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
i
heard
like
a
*
whisper
*
in
my
ear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

that
to

,
when
we
go
downstairs
alone
I
just
tap
him
or
like
stare
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have

a
long
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
sometimes
I
forget
to
read
the
manual
and
then
it
comes
out
all
wrong
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
the
satisfaction
of
building
it
correctly
without
the
manual
is
too
great
so
I
like
to
try
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
*
and
eventually
fail

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

s
a
thriller
murder
mystery
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So

every
episode
there
’
s
a
new
case
for
murder
,
and
these
lawyers
have
to
basically
try
and
deduct
who
was
the
murderer
in
that
episode
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
cousin
introduced
me
to
it
,
and
it
sounded
like
something
you
may
be
interested
in
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
I
will
start
when
I

with
the
pakistani
show
I

yesterday
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nice
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
um
random
question
:
what
are
your
thoughts
on
spiders
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
like
to
put
them
down
the
sink
drain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😅
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
are
you
like
scared
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Not
really
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
freak
out
,
like
even
a
picture
is
enough
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
squish
them
if
they
’
re
in
my
house
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
arghhhhh
i
run
and
find
someone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
A
pretty
good
method
of
killing
them
is
also
just
grabbing
the
vaccuum
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
just
suck
them
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Works
like
a
charm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
no
,
if
there
is
a
spider
in
my
house
,
I
am
not
getting
anything
,
I
will
simply
just
move
out
of
the
house
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Have
you
seen
the
adorable
spider
?

it
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

was
just
too
good
to
pass
up
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
any
other
bug

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
am
pretty
sure
i
have
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
that
experiment
clearly
failed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
now
that
you
’
ve
seen
it
I
’
m
guessing
it
doesn
’
t
work
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Ok

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
not
scared
of
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
those
are
like
weird
you
just
use
a
broom
and
lead
them
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
they
make
me
jump
if
they
try
to
jump
away
from
me
when
I
try
to
kill
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
annoying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
that
feeling
is
pretty
annoying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
other
than
that
…
I
can
’
t
really
think
of
any
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
squishable
,
then
it
’
s
all
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
i
wish
i
could
squish
a
bug
or
kill
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
dont
even
have
that
in
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
takes
some
courage
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
what
are
you
doing
at
the
moment
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
still
at
my
cousins
house
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
cousin
just
made
me
have
this
dish
where
it
’
s
like
mango
drenched
in
something
spicy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
stomach
is
burning
so
hard
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
was
so
spicy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
this
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
=
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
no
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Lemme
take
a
picture
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
This
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
what
it
’
s
called
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
my
god
my
mouth
was
burning
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
that
is
just
aachar
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
looks
so
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
think
its
meant
to
be
spicy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
way
more
spicy
than
typical
aachar
trust
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
know
but
like
this
was
a
different
beast
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
have
a
pretty
decent
spice
tolerance
and
this
almost
killed
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
i
love
trying
deadly
spicy
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
think
they
may
have
screwed
up
the
ratio
with
sweet
and
spicy
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
maybe
maybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
couldn
’
t
be
me
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
congrats
!
you
'
re
not
dead
yet
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
tried
the
ghost
pepper
chip
challenge
thing
and
that
scarred
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
was
so
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
I
would
not
do
,
I
need
spice
with
flavour
,
not
just
spice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
tasted
terrible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
,
and
why
did
you
do
that
,
was
it
with
friends
or
you
just
woke
up
and
was
like
,
let
me
do
this
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
with
friends
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
lost
a
bet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Back
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
didn
’
t
have
milk
either
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
I
literally
felt
like
I
was
burning
from
inside
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
for
the
entire
day
and
the
next
day
I
felt
like
garbage
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
would
not
recommend
unless
you
have
milk
or
ice
cream
on
standby
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
cant
even
imagine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
wont
do
those
things
,
there
ia
a
difference
between
enjoying
spicy
food
and
doing
a
challenge
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
it
’
s
best
to
stay
away
from
those
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Now
something
really
spicy
I
enjoy
is
a
good
howlin
rays
sandwich
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
that
aachar
seriously
looked
bomb
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
deadly
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
What
is
your
favorite
kind
of
chips
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Either
Funyuns
or
hot
Cheetos
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
go
back
and
forth
depending
on
the
mood
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wbu
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
those
are
amazing
,
i
personally
love
Cheetos
fries
but
second
is
hot
Cheetos
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hot
Cheetos
fries
are
so
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
they
are
like
so
awesome
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
can
finish
an
entire
bag
in
one
sitting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Saaaaaame
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Put
a
good
show
on
and
that
thing
is
gone
by
the
first
episode
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
spicy
chips
are
way
better
than
normal
chips
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
,
before
it
even
starts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yes
except
for
Funyuns
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
the
base
Funyuns
taste
better
than
the
spicy
variant
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
if
we
are
watching
a
movie
and
that
thing
is
in
front
of
me
,
it
will
be
done
by
the
time
we
choose
something
to
watch
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
🤣
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
debatable
based
on
the
mood
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

you
ever
tried
street
elote
?
[prabipyakurel]

a
few
people

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

always
be

[sskarz]
The
pizza

was
really
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
standing
in
that
line
for
close
to
an
hour
was
not
ideal
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
was
raining
that
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

,
that
part
sucks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
rain
is
fun
,
its
fun
to
go
out
in
the
rain
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
got
scolded
by
my
teacher
back
in
may
for
opening
her
door
and
going
into
the
rain
when
there
was
lightning
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
ever
try
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yes
if
and
only
if
I
literally
have
no
responsibilities
or
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
actually
reminds
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
i
guess
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Back
in
Rome
,
my
sister
and
I
were
eating
at
a
restaurant
,
and
soon
after
we
finished
,
a
thunderstorm
started
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oof
,
did
you
go
out
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
there
were
no
taxis
available
or
in
sight
,
they
all
wanted
to
avoid
the
storm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
bruh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
we
had
to
run
and
walk
like
3
miles
back
in
the
heavy
rain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
was
so
so
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
when
they
would
make
the
most
money
,
dumb
taxi
drivers
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
it
was
during
a
time
that
my
eyes
were
still
extremely
sensitive
to
water
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Since
I
had
my
surgery
a
week
prior
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
my
eyes
were
burning
the
entire
run
back
to
the
hotel
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
One
of
the
worst
travel
memories
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
in
those
cases
,
oh
I
can
’
t
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
that
would
suck
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
if
it
was
back
home
and
I
was
feeling
it
,
then
yeah
why
not
it
’
s
fun
to
get
wet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
must
have
been
scary
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

hurt
a
lot
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
I

a

writing

minds

more
creative
,
and
you
as
a
kid
,
I
am
certain
that
the
piece

was
brilliant

[prabipyakurel]

nothing
like
that
incredible
haha
,
you

This
is
from
what
I
remember
from
some
years
ago
[sskarz]
The
setting
was
a
mystical
place
where
people
could
harness
the
powers
of
the
planets
,
as
the
universe
revolved
around
their
world
,
their
lives
were
destined
to
revolve
space
and
the
universe
around
them
.
There
were
colonies
of
different
planets
like
Mercury
,
Earth
,
Saturn
,
etc
.
that
all
had
different
ideologies
about
how
the
world
functions
.
Many
of
the
conflicts
in
that
society
occurred
because
of
conflicting
ideas
between
colonies
,
and
would
result
in
turmoil
for
both
sides
.
So
,
an
order
was
formed
,
The
Planetary
Order
,
which
harnessed
the
power
of
the
Sun
,
and
there
were
only
5
individuals
that
could
wield
this
power
.
They
were
exceptional
,
right
from
birth
,
seen
as
gods
and
as
the
absolute
right
.
Anyone
that
dared
to
oppose
them
were
considered
outcasts
,
never
to
be
taken
seriously
,
and
always
viewed
as
a
threat
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
story
revolved
around
a
man
that
was
falsely
accused
(
this
was
not
known
yet
in
the
beginning
)
of
violating
the
Planetary
Order
(
basically
the
government
),
of
supposedly
murdering
a
family
from
the
Mars
Colony
.
This
man
was
completely
innocent
,
but
was
framed
by
someone
else
seeing
him
at
the
crime
scene
.
He
was
brought
upon
the
Planetary
Order
'
s
Court
,
and
deemed
sentence
to
death
to
eternity
.
It
seemed
that
this
man
'
s
fate
was
sealed
,
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
possibly
do
to
escape
from
the
chains
that
binded
him
to
the
Court
'
s
ground
.
As
the
guillotine
came
down
,
an
explosion
happened
,
the
court
was
attacked
by
a
mysterious
group
of
people
.
See
,
there
weren
'
t
just
the
planets
in
the
solar
system
that
could
give
powers
,
and
it
wasn
'
t
a
star
either
,
rather
the
space
that
fills
the
rest
of
the
distance
between
planets
and
stars
and
galaxies
.
The
Void
itself
,
which
was
infamous
for
denying
government
power
and
always
seeked
righteousness
in
the
free
will
.
The
man
is
then
taken
by
The
Void
,
and
together
with
that
group
of
people
,
he
seeks
to
take
revenge
upon
the
Planetory
Order
,
and
seek
the
man
that
framed
him
.

Dude

was
soooooo

from
the
beginnning

I

It
is
amazing
that
you
wrote
about
things
like
this
when
you
were
little
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
awwww
thank
you
!!!
I
wish
I
still
had
the
story
files
,
I
was
super
passionate
about
that
for
like
a
year
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
don
'
t
you
continue
the
story
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
...
I
'
d
have
to
find
where
I
stored
all
that
writing
somewhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
start
from
scratch
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
continue
from
how
you
remember
and
just
write
,
lets
the
words
flow
with
your
imagination
and
wisdom
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
definitely
could
,
but
I
remember
hitting
a
lot
of
writing
blocks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
always
suffered
with
that
inconsistency
of
creativity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
but
the
fact
that
you
explained
the
summary
so
well
in
a
couple
of
minutes
was
amazing
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
read
that
book
if

I
remember
having
a
lot
of
fun

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wanted
it
to
be
hundreds
of
pages
long
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

its
somewhere
in

kind
of
concept
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
had
the
story
set
for
the
protaganist
to
be
filled
with
rage
during
the
beginning
of
the
story
,
but
slowly
change
his
mentality
as
he
gets
closer
and
closer
to
getting
revenge
against
his
framer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
you
had
this
planned
out
huh
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
from
being
petty
and
vengeful
,
to
being
the
bigger
person
and
not
continuing
the
cycle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
had
writing
notes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wanted
to
flesh
out
his
character
to
be
interesting
and
to
prove
that
people
can
change

Cleaning

and
figuring

what
I
need
to

and
what
I
can
leave
here
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

Berkely
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
August
15th
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
wow
so
you
only
have
a
month
and
some
days
left
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
must
be
so
nervewracking
to
get
closer
to
that
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
It
makes
me
sad
when
I
think
about
it
,
I
wan
'
t
to
leave
and
like
study
but
at
the
same
time
,
I
am
sad
to
leave
everything
behind
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
just
the
thought
of
going
into
the
dorm
and
staying
with
roommates
and
not
seeing
family
everyday
is
really
depressing
,
and
I
just
try
not
to
think
about
it
yet
because
then
I
start
crying
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
awwww
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
sure
for
what
I
can
say
,
that
just
sounds
really
hard
to
deal
with
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
I
think
that
this
is
gods
plan
and
I
will
just
go
along
with
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Life
happens
for
its
reasons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
I
will
be
back
for
the
summer
,
so
I
think
that
is
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
comes
around
real
fast
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
like
highschool
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
those
days
went
by
really
really
quick
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
,
honestly
you
are
right
,
time
flies
by
fast
and
people
keep
telling
me
that
these
4
years
(
or
3
)
are
going
to
fly
by
really
fast
,
but
I
don
'
t
know
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
once
I
start
getting
used
to
it
,
It
won
'
t
feel
as
sad
anymore
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
new
adventure
,
new
friends
,
new
hobbies
,
it
all
comes
in
at
once
so
once
you
start
to
learn
how
to
juggle
all
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
kind
of
just
goes
by
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
at
least
that
'
s
how
it
feels
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
for
sure
,
it
will
be
a
new
experience
for
sure
.

[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
looking
back
at
high
school
when
I
used
to
think
about
how
great
it
would
be
to
go
to
Berkeley
and
study
there
,
and
the
closer
it
gets
,
the
more
reality
hits
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
is
what
it
is

bored
,
but
also
idk
what
to
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

are
on
a
voice
call
,
i
hope
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
pretty
boring
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
trying
to
customize
my
desktop
screen
and
i
got
pretty
far
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
it
took
so
much
out
of
me
mentally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
don
'
t
like
coding
when
im
not
in
the
mood
:/
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
in
the
bright
side
,
you
did
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
alright
,
sometimes
just
resting
and
thinking
about
nothing
helps
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
actually
read
something
about
how
boredom
is
good
for
the
mind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
like
a
whole
scientific
article
,
forgot
where
i
read
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
boredom
is
good
for
mind
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
time
to
be
more
bored
than
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
essentially
,
its
cleanses
your
mind
from
constantly
needing
to
satisfy
your
dopamine
receptors
in
your
head
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Very
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
with
the
coming
generation
and
times
,
attention
span
and
that
constant
feeding
of
dopamine
to
the
brain
is
causing
a
lot
of
issues
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
,
yea
the
upcoming
generation
is
going
to
be
a
lot
to
deal
with
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
i
meant
our
generation
but
ya
essentially
that
too
💀*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OH
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
with
like
tiktok
and
shorter
form
content
being
fed
constantly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
kind
of
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
true
thats
true
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
social
media
has
changed
a
lot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
,
i
'
m
getting
pretty
exhausted
from
the
amount
of
social
media
outlets
and
just
general
necessity
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
on
iphone
there
is
this
like
screen
time
tracker
that
checks
how
long
you
use
your
phone
on
average
across
a
week
and
then
sends
a
report
,
so
I
'
ve
been
using
that
to
slowly
reduce
that
as
much
as
I
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
,
like
looking
back
at
when
we
were
little
and
how
we
werent
too
into
all
this
social
media
,
life
was
wayyy
more
peaceful
too
.

its
tempting
to
just
open
it
and
have
a
short
look
at
it
.

t
say
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

right

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
there
were
some
informational
ones
i
used
to
listen
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
one
of
them
was
like
this
psychological
podcast
that
explained
different
behaviors
and
disorders
every
episode
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
that
one
was
pretty
interesting
,
but
at
some
point
it
was
a
bit
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
seems

interesting

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
was
genuinely
interested
in
that
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
that
podcast
kinda
seemed
naturally
interesting
,
but
it
went
into
so
much
detail
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
had
planned
on
taking
that
in
high
school
but
I
had
7th
period
and
the
only
space
available
was
0
period
and
my
counselor
looked
at
me
and
went
,
"

want
8
classes
senior
year
",
and

let
it

way
back
because
more
than
half
my
height
is
from
my
legs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
whenever
my
parents
try
to
drive
my
car
,
they
have
to
move
it
back
up
and
its
always
just
a
constant
battle
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
thats
not
bad
,
If
i
move
up
the
accelerator
is
too
close
to
my
feet
and
if
I
move
back
I
can
'
t
reach
the
breaks
.

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

a
room
with
your
brother
right

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

your
old
house
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
way
smaller
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
everything
was
smaller
,
now
when
we
go
there
it
still
feels
like
home
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
after
he
came
back
,
did
you
2
share
again
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

the
house
I

in
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
we

a
guest
room

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
why
,
did
you
feel
someone
was
there
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
had
a
lot
of
weird
interactions
with
like
random
door
openings
,
creaks
from
stairs
or
downstairs
when
no
one
is
home
,
ghost
steps
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
had
a
bunch
of
weird
dreams
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
nah
it
scared
the
crap
out
of
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
dreams
it
might
have
been
because
you
watched
or
thought
too
deeply
about
those
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
understand
you
were
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
when
I
was
young
,
I
would
shut
off
the
lights
so
fast
and
run
to
sleep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
confirmation
bias
was
probably
a
huge
contributor
to
those
experiences
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
were
afraid
of
the
dark
?
[sskarz]

of
paper
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
on
paper
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
it
answered
a
lot
of
questions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
think
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
this
was
a
long
time
ago
,
it
could
'
ve
been
something
else
but
I
'
m
pretty
sure
it
was
on
paper
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
listen
listen
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
couldn
'
t
sleep
that
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
so
scared
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
was
it
recent
,
or
a
while
back
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
understand
if
you
were
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
a
couple
years
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
when
I
was
15
or
16
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
did
you
have
like
nightmares
after
or
were
you
like
just
scared
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
I
was
just
scared
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
ever
tell
your
parents
you
were
scared
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
when
you
feel
scared
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
me
neither
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
mean
my
parents
are
the
type
to
listen
to
that
,
and
then
just
start
laughing
which
I
totally
understand
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
as
a
kid
,
my
god
that
wouldn
'
t
have
made
anything
better
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
all
parents
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
be
like
"
there
is
nothing
there
,
oh
its
gonna
eat
you
,
its
gonna
take
you
away
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Never
made
me
feel
more
assured
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
would
totally
do
that
as
a
parent
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
be
like
,
"
stop
being
a
kid
,
deal
with
it
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
makes
sense
the
more
you
grow
up
about
the
things
our
parents
told
us
when
we
were
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
used
to
think
so
differently
back
then
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
maturity
actually
does
is
wild
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
we
need
to
play
the
ouija

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We

dangerous
things
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
give
me
the
time
and
the
place
,
I
'
m
down
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
there
aren

t
many
people
that
are
willing
to
do
such
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
as
soon
as
i
get
some
time
a
peace
in

,
definitely
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

[prabipyakurel]

why
I

so
glad

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
of

!
been
waiting
for
a
person
to
be
willing
to
try
these
things
out
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
just
let
me
know
when
you
'
re
ready
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
seriously
people
be
scared
when
you
mention
these
things
and
they
havent
even
tried
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frrrrrrrrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
have
a
friend
that
is
scared
of
Knotts
Berry
'
s
Farm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
'
m
like
bruh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
not
been
there
,
but
the
rides
dont
even
seem
scary
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
'
re
a
total
push
over
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
they
look
like
the
beginner
version
of
six
flags
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
are
fun
,
but
they
'
re
like
the
elementary
to
middle
school
levels
of
rides
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
then
you
promote
to
six
flags
,
where
its
like
high
school
and
college
level
rides
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
voila
,
you
'
ve
graduated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
how
you
explain
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
quite
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
then
I
guess
masters
and
PHD
come
in
the
forms
of
bungee
jumping
and
sky
diving
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ok
i
have
a
question
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
when
you
'
re
like
studying
50
terms
of
something
,
like
lets
say
political
terms
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
do
you
try
and
remember
those
50
terms
and
their
definition
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
method
do
you
use
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
take
a
line
sheet
of
paper
that
I
split
in
half
and
write
the
rod
on
one
side
and
definition
on
the
other
,
say
them
line
by
line
at
least
10
times
each
,
and
soon
start
covering
one
side
of
the
paper
and
see
if
I
can
say
definition
just
looking
at
the
word
and
vice
versa
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
HBU
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhh
so
you
take
it
a
very
literal
way
of
memorization
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
cool
because
I
do
it
totally
differrent
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
Don
'
t
Even
Know
-
Saturday
Night
Live
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
how
do
you
think
i
passed
spanish
buddy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
???
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
DO
you
use
flashcards
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
cuz
u
just
a
genius
buddy
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
try
and
associate
certain
terms
to
a
term
or
something
physical
I
'
m
very
familiar
with
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
ahhh
yes
i
have
been
told
to
try
that
,
never
tried
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
like
lets
say
the
word
is
government
,
and
the
definition
is
blah
blah
blah
,
I
try
and
remember
government
and
relate
it
to
something
like
Planetary
Order
which
I
created
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
helps
a
lot
to
remember
these
things
by
association
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
creative
mind
,
I
could
never
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
used
to
do
quizlet
setups
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
just
lock
myself
in
a
room
and
need
to
be
able
reading
it
over
and
over
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
do
that
anymore
,
it
would
drive
my
brain
to
boredom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
quizlet
is
fun
,
thats
how
i
memorized
most
of
the
27
amendments
and
50
states
and
capital
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
this
one
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
back
in
my
middle
school
,
I
had
a
chemistry
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
he
never
gave
us
extra
credit
for
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
on
the
final
week
,
he
said
if
you
can
memorize
the
entirety
of
the
periodic
table
in
order
and
give
me
the
symbols
in
2
days
,
he
would
give
just
a
few
points
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
on
our
final
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
for
the
next
2
days
,
i
sat
down
and
did
association
on
every
single
element
,
and
memorized
the
periodic
table
song
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
dont
tell
me
you
memorized
the
table
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
the
only
person
in
the
class
to
do
that
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
the
one
asian
that
didnt
look
asian
but
was
called
smart
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
felt
like
the
dumbest
person
,
all
i
did
was
my
work
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
"

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

'
s
inside
yeah
,
usually
he
wakes
up
around
that
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
need
to
let
him
do
his
potty

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
neighbors
on
the

hand
leave
their
dogs
outside
even
thought
the
winter
and
they

bark
and
whine
all
night
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
'
s
my
little
brother
so
ofc
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
awwwww
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
so
sweet
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
sometimes
bear
does
bark
saying
he
wants
to
be
inside
,
but
I
only
bring
him
in
if
its
too
hot
/
cold
out
or
fireworks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
otherwise
he
gets
spoiled
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
,
that
makes
sense
,
dogs
scare
me
but
it
makes
me
sad
when
i
see
people
mistreat
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
have
you
ever
wanted
a
pet
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
when
I
was
younger
I
wanted
a
dog
because
I
was
fine
around
them
but
now
that
I
freak
out
near
them
.
If
i
were
to
get
a
pet
I
would
get
a
pomeranian
because
they
are
like
the
fluffiest
dogs
or
like
bunnies
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
In
nepal
,
my
dad
had
brought
me
like
5
bunnies
,
and
all
of
them
had
a
tragic
death
and
we
lost
them
quickly
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
awwww
I
'
m
sorry
to
hear
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
was
like
4
,
but
i
remember
one
ran
away
,
the
other
fell
off
a
roof
,
and
the
rest
,
god
knows
where
they
went
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
wow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
guess
they
'
re
relatively
hard
to
maintain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
for
me
at
least
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
think
i
let
them
free
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
probably
my
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
were
pretty
young
so
it
must
be
hard
to

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
life

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
did
you
always
have
a
dog
or
did
you
have
a
different
pet
before
bear
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
did
have
another
dog
before
bear
,
his
name
was
Mickey
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
he
was
a
pure
GSD
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
aww
how
you
pick
these
names
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
are
so
adorable
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
my
dad
had
another
dog
before
my
Mickey
,
and
his
first
dog
was
named
Mickey
but
that
passed
away
when
my
dad
was
in
his
early
20s
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
then
he
got
another
dog
when
I
was
around
6
years
old
and
we
had
Mickey
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
sorry
to
hear
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
then
he
passed
away
when
I
was
around
14
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
its
okay
,
its
only
good
memories
with
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
just
remember
the
good
moments
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
14
or
15
when
he
passed
,
I
remember
I
was
in
sophomore
year
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
I
came
back
home
one
day
after
a
week
being
worried
about
what
happened
to
Mickey
since
he
went
to
the
hospital
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
I
saw
a
new
small
dog
,
but
I
never
saw
Mickey
afterwards
so
it
kind
of
clicked
with
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Bear
is
now
around
5
years
old
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Or

was
older

force
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

the
point
that
he
recognizes
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

a
lot
friendlier
especially
if
you
speak
Nepali
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
understands
it
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

'
s
your
best
friend
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
anyway
,
you
were
explaining
your
bullying
incident
yesterday
,
and
I
totally
forgot
to
get
back
to
you
on
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
i
don
'
t
really
have
like
a
full
on
story
from
my
history
with
being
a
victim
of
bullying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
never
affected
me
personally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
really
,
yea
you
were
strong
then
,
I
have
been
like
called
names
,
and
been
hated
on
for
no
reason
by
very
specific
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
someone
ever
tried
to
call
me
names
or
even
physically
push
me
or
something
,
i
'
d
either
ignore
them
or
respond
with
a
remark
of
some
sort
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
a
pretty
good
strategy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
sorry
to
hear
that
,
i
know
im
not
like
the
average
person
dealing
with
bullying
and
it
does
affect
people
a
lot
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
hope
it
doesn
'
t
affect
you
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
but
there
was
one
story
which
i
found
pretty
cool
back
when
i
was
in
elementary
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lets
hear
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
this
one
time
i
had
a
friend
named
Pablo
and
he
was
a
pretty
short
kid
and
he
used
to
get
bullied
by
these
group
of
dudes
that
were
bigger
and
taller
than
him
,
like
the
upperclassmen
.
anywho
one
day
I
was
just
walking
with
him
and
these
dudes
tried
to
instigate
something
with
Pablo
by
pushing
him
slightly
and
calling
him
some
dirty
stuff
and
we
were
on
the
playground
during
recess
.
at
some
point
,
for
some
reason
,
i
just
walked
up
to
one
of
the
guys
that
kept
harassing
him
and
straight
punched
him
in
the
face
,
and
then
i
took
pablo
and
left
.
apparently
,
shortly
after
I
found
out
that
I
actually
broke
a
part
of
his
nose
,
but
I
explained
the
situation
and
I
only
got
detention
for
about
2
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
you
are
a
really
good
friend
first
of
all
,
and
wow
you
were
quite
a
fighter
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
never
tried
with
pablo
,
instead
i
was
the
one
that
they
kept
going
at
but
again
it
never
bothered
me
and
i
stopped
physically
dealing
with
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
he
probably
deserved
to
have
his
nose
broken
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
me
fr
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
a
complete
douchebag
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
seemed
mean
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
honestly
I
have
been
in
your
friends
situation
and
it
went
on
for
a
while
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
like
back
in
6th
and
7th
grade
there
were
these
boys
who
would
call
me
indian
,
and
i
had
told
them
many
times
that
I
am
not
indian
.
THen
they
would
start
talking
about
how
I
dont
belong
here
and
should
go
back
to
my
county
.
Just
brutal
,
I
would
be
crying
and
they
would
just
be
laughing
.
It
got
to
the
point
where
like
I
didn
'
t
want
to
come
to
school
because
I
would
see
them
.
But
in
8th
grade
we
were
good
and
they
stopped
doing
those
tasks
,
probably
because
i
had
answers
to
homework
and
stuff
.
But
yea
they
even
like
threw
dirt
on
my
face
and
stuff
like
that
.
As
memorable
as
middle
school
was
there
were
so
many
other
things
that
happened
that
still
makes
me
wonder
,
why
I
didnt
have
it
in
me
to
tell
anyone
or
say
anything
back
to
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
wow
,
I
'
m
sorry
you
had
to
deal
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
people
like
that
just
don
'
t
make
sense
to
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
ever
experience
something
like
that
,
always
stand
up
for
yourself
,
if
not
then
have
someone
else
stand
up
for
you
,
otherwise
they
never
stop
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
from
my
experience
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
yea
we
went
to
different
high
school
and
after
I
got
insta
one
of
them
requested
to
follow
me
,
so
i
was
like
its
been
a
while
,
lets
forgive
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
nice
of
you
,
personally
if
i
had
experienced
what
you
went
through
,
no
way
in
hell
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
my
best
friend
did
that
,
she
had
instagram
in
like
6th
grade
and
I
told
her
,
I
actually
cried
to
her
,
and
then
she
searched
his
name
,
and
messaged
him
directly
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
good
,
but
physical
confrontation
will
always
triumph
over
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
I
see
them
again
,
no
matter
how
much
they
apologized
,
what
they
did
will
kind
of
stay
with
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
now
i
probably
got
lucky
,
since
i
used
to
taunt
alot
of
them
that
tried
to
harass
me
,
which
could
'
ve
ended
poorly
but
thank
god
they
weren
'
t
maniacs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
can
imagine
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
thats
good
,
it
was
good
of
you
to
be
able
to
talkback
to
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
thought
they
were
gonna
blame
something
on
me
and
I
would
get
in
trouble
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
never
have
the
balls
to
do
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
usually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
older
I
got
I
realized
it
was
a
them
problem
not
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
mean
if
u
think
about
it
,
you
'
re
gonna
be
way
more
successful
than
them
in
the
future
,
and
that
'
s
how
i
always
thought
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
eh
,
in
the
grand
scheme
of
things
they
are
just
some
pebble
in
the
road
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
are
right
,
I
always
had
that
thought
on
the
back
of
my
head
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
are
tiny
compared
to
our
real
ambitions

name
but
i
used
to
watch
it
alongside
spongebob
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
the
sheep
one
,
what
show
is
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
wait
is
that
a
sheep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
all
i
knew
it
by
was
the
show
right
after
spongebob
stopped
airing
for
the
day
on
nickleodeon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
a
sheep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
got
a
bit
confused
right
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
never
watched
spongebob
growing
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
my
go
to
was
tom
and
jerry
and
arthur
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
:
O
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
tom
and
jerry
is
a
banger
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
loved
that
show
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
d
say
80
%
of
the
shows
i
watched
as
a
kid
was
spongebob
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
to
the
point
there
was
a
time
in
my
life
where
i
had
memorized
every
single
episode
in
every
season
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
we
only
had
nickleodeon
on
cable
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
for
kids
shows
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
,
how
about
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
foggy
,
but
if
i
saw
the
title
and
maybe
the
first
minute
i
'
d
probably
remember
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
we
had
just
the
normal
cable
and
stuck
to
PBS
kids
shows
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
up
to
season
5
i
remember
the
clearest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ah
nice
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
im
managing
some
of
my
finances
and
doing
some
work
i
backlogged
some
weeks
ago
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
not
really
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
actually
quite
boring
and
too
much
math
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
math
is
painful
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
sometimes
its
good
math
but
mostly
its
bad
math
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
loved
it
until
they
started
introducing
the
alphabet
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
why
did
they
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
thought
math
was
just
numbers
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
the
greek
alphabet
got
involved
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
im
like
why
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
makes
no
sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
physics
changed
me
forever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
god
,
physics
was
scary
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
rotational
physics
had
me
stressing
like
nothing
before
back
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
a
really
hard
ass
teacher
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
like
half
the
class
failed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
looks
like
some
alien
language
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
ended
with
a
miracle
B
in
the
AP
Physics
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
never
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

1
person

an
A
and
like
6
people
got
a
B
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
teacher
wanted
people
to
fail

one
person

a
supercomputer
brain
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
hats

to
that
dude
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

same
,

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
in
high

80
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

there
was
this
English
assignment
that
dropped
my
grade
to
a
B
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
crazy
,
but
watch

drop
when
I
got
to
college
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hold
on
parents
calling
me
,
i

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
greek
yogurt
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i

wrong
from

,

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

things
in
a
week
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
3
days
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
unfortunately
im
an
introvert
so
its
probably
gonna
be
spent
at
home
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
with
the
AC
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
sometimes
the
breeze
hits
our
house
so
we
leave
the
backyard
gate
open
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
doesn
'
t
mean
someone
could
just
stroll
on
in
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
no
we
have
2
doors
,
one
is
a
metal
one
outside
and
the
second
is
glass
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
gotcha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
i
do
the
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
someone
strolled
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
hi
,
can
i
come
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
i
love
this
guy
'
s
jokes
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
hell
naw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
did
i
tell
you
about
the
incident
where
my
parents
thought
we
got
kidnapped
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
????????
but
am
interested
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
i
think
it
was
like
2
weeks
ago
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
around
2
pm
the
power
went
out
on
this
house
and
our
neighbors
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
with
no
internet
,
the
ring
camera
all
around
stopped
working
,
the
wifi
was
no
longer
here
,
and
data
decided
to
give
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
couldnt
call
anyone
or
text
or
message
anyone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
neither
could
we
receive
any
calls
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
my
dad
tried
several
times
from
work
to
chek
what
was
wrong
with
the
camera
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
THey
thought
someone
broke
in
and
broke
the
camera
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
mom
left
work
in
an
emergency
and
thought
someone
broke
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
thankfully
the
power
came
back
as
she
was
on
her
way
and
I
got
scolded
first
then
they
understood
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
kinda
hilarious
but
they
were
like
panicking
,
so
I
felt
bad
for
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
yea
that
pretty
much
sums
up
everything
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
that
'
s
scary
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
as
a
parent
i
would
'
ve
been
panicking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
we
were
kinda
assuming
one
of
them
were
gonna
come
home
to
check
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
is
pretty
terrifying
even
from
your
perspective
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
would
'
ve
grabbed
some
kind
of
weapon
just
in
case
i
was
about
to
get
robbed
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
and
our
neighborhood
is
quiet
,
no
one
is
out
on
sthe
streets
or
anyting
during
the
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
we
just
locked
our
doors
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
if
anything
we
were
going
to
take
a
walk
to
the
south
el
monte
city
hall
down
the
street
and
as
if
we
can
make
a
call
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
that
was
like
our
only
option
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
that
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
would
'
ve
gone
to
the
nearest
gas
station
or
something
to
ask
to
make
a
call
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
idk
with
the
power
gone
,
maybe
that
wouldn
'
t
have
worked
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
maybe
maybe
,
how
you
guys
charge
tesla
with
the
power
gone
?
I
don
'
t
know
if
this
is
a
dumb
question
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
we
have
a
backup
power
source
,
but
we
wouldn
'
t
charge
the
tesla
at
home
since
I
'
m
not
sure
it
can
support
charging
the
car
with
the
backup
generator
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
in
that
case
,
if
we
have
some
miles
left
,
then
we
would
just
drive
down
to
the
nearest
super
charger
and
charge
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
if
that
didn
'
t
work
,
then
we
also
have
gas
cars
to
use
just
in
case
they
are
all
dead
in
battery
,
which
the
chance
of
that
happening
is
basically
0
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
thats
sounds
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
we
haven
'
t
had
a
power
outage
in
a
while
tho
,
if
we
do
then
its
usually
my
room
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
sometimes
i
use
a
bit
too
much
power
than
intended
and
then
shuts
off
in
the
breaker
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
just
your
room
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
rip
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
a
computer
that
takes
around
850
Watts
on
its
own
,
then
an
entire
AC
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
my
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
doesn
'
t
include
the
house
AC
,
literally
just
an
AC
unit
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
if
i
keep
both
on
for
a
very
long
time
and
both
are
at
full
use
,
it
can
shut
down
the
entire
room
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
happened
like
twice
in
the
last
4
years
so
its
not
a
big
issue
but
its
there
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
crazy

level
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
the
best
thing
I

lego
sets
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
those
looked
pretty
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ironically
that
'
s
the
place
where
i
get
what
i

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
t
tempt
me
with
the
lego
death
star
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
mean

go
to
costco
,
and
start
from
the
first
isle
to
the
end
looking
for
things

possibly
get

[prabipyakurel]

as
a
little
kid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

2
small
ones
stuck
where
they
shouldn
'
t
be
and
you
got
no
nails
to
separate
them
[prabipyakurel]

Hello

,

how
has
the
rest
of
your
day
been
like
,
you
know
aside
from
your
dangerous
amazon
shopping
spree
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
do
you
want
the
long
answer
or
the
short
answer
,
or
a
list
of
pros
and
cons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lets
go
with
the
pros
and
cons
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
like
how
you
have
options
of
explaining
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
must
have
been
interesting
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
pros
:
[sskarz]
just
had
dinner
[sskarz]
my
dog
hugged
me
[sskarz]
had
a
meeting
where
i
didn
'
t
have
to
do
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
cons
:
[sskarz]
my
computer
literally
died
[sskarz]
i
had
to
troubleshoot
it
for
4
hours
straight
and
I
'
ve
finally
gotten
to
a
stable
position
[sskarz]
my
mental
health
is
dwindling
as
my
PC
dwindles
[sskarz]
i
had
a
meeting
during
all
of
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
little
doggy
hug
,
the
meeting
seems
pretty
easy
,
what
did
you
have
for
dinner
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
time
to
get
your
computer
a
friend
I
guess
,
you
know
so
when
one
died
its
friend
can
replace
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

mental
sanity
to

something
at

time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

Um

than

for
a
while
,
took
a
nap
,
and
watched
TV
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
too
special
,
and
took
care
of
some
essentials
for
class
enrollment
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nice

like
a
peaceful
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep

calm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
yearn
for
those
days

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Today

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
motto
in
life
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
,
sometimes
I
feel
like
I
don
'
t
like
even
know
what
I
am
doing
,
but
then
I
am
like
at
least
I
have
a
plan
and
an
aim
to
do
something
.
and
then
it
feels
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
gotta
remember
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
who
actually
knows
what
they
'
re
doing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
likely
,
not
a
lot
of
people
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
have
some
sense
of
direction
,
already
ahead
of
everyone
else
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
like
thinking
of
it
that
way
,
like
looking
at
how
people
now
always
like
wonder
around
no
knowing
what
it
right
for
them
is
kind
of
sad
,
but
makes
me
feel
assured
that
I
have
some
sense
of
direction
in
life
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
saw
that
from
some
motivational
video
i
saw
on
youtube
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
some
years
ago
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
had
real
statistics
behind
it
as
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
like
one
of
those
ted
talks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
do
you
watch
ted
talks
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
i
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
used
to
anyhow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
me
too
,
not
so
much
anymore
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
if
you
'
ve
watched
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
there
was
that
one
ted
talk
episode
where
a
guy
perfectly
describes
procrastination
and
how
it
works
in
the
brain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
used
like
a
monkey
steering
a
ship
as
an
example
or
something
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
one
of
the
more
popular
episodes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OH
wow
,
maybe
i
have
not
seen
that
but
I
will
check
it
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
pretty
insightful
for
how
it
works
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
explained
in
a
very
easy
to
understand
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
sometimes
like
you
need
to
hear
someone
explain
to
you
that
its
fine
to
be
behind
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
a
week
ago
I
was
talking
to
my
berkeley
academic
advisor
and
she
was
talking
to
like
a
group
of
people
including
me
and
was
like
"
its
okay
to
feel
lost
sometimes
and
feel
like
you
are
behind
,
but
you
have
to
look
back
at
how
much
you
have
progressed
"
and
that
hit
me
.
Now
I
take
my
time
instead
of
stressing
myself
out
,
somewhat
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
'
ve
got
a
really
smart
advisor
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
100
%
agreed
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
me
to
my
computer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
a
very
expensive
challenge
that
i
pray

'
t
accidentally
blow
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
probably
you
everytime
something
techy
goes
wrong
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
why
you
get
it
a
friend
so
if
one
friend
blows
up
,
the
other
is
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
be
careful
and
go
slow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
dont
start
like
a
fire
or
something
in
the
process
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

good
afternoon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
finally
been
able
to
text
without
running
around
everywhere
since
the
morning
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
did
your
class
picking
go
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
its
been
a
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
a
small
breakdown
for
the
past
few
hours
but
now
things
are
looking
a
little
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
why
'
s
that
if
I
could
ask
?
are
you
okay
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Shooting
your
head
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
I
am
okay
now
,
its
because
I
had
my
classes
chosen
and
my
enrollment
period
began
at
12
:
40
.
However
everyone
had
different
time
slots
and
those
that
had
the
time
from
9
:
00
to
11
:
00
,
they
picked
out
all
the
english
classes
and
social
science
classes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
hate
the
UC
berkeley
system
right
now
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
what
?!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
did
you
choose
for
your
classes
then
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
have
been
just
scrolling
to
find
a
physical
science
class
for
the
past
30
minutes
that
doesnt
mess
with
my
schedule
and
fits
the
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
far
I
got
Math
,
History
(
not
the
most
interesting
),
and
Sociology
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
okay
at
least
you
got
your
main
courses
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
its
okay
,
you
can
waitlist
and
wait
for
people
to
drop
,
but
also
at
least
this
isn
'
t
a
major
course
for
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
I
asked
and
the
english
can
be
taken
in
the
spring
semester
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
because
everyone
was
on
the
site
,
it
was
loading
so
much
,
I
wanted
to
throw
my
laptop
downstairs
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
even
sat
next
to
the
wifi
routers
for
it
to
load
faster
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
awesome
!
just
switch
it
out
for
another
course
you
'
ll
have
to
take
in
spring
and
you
should
be
golden
still
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
,
yea
hopefully
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
unfortunately
this
stuff
can
suck
,
maybe
next
semester
you
can
get
into
early
enrollment
programs
?
I
'
m
pretty
sure
every
uni
has
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
hoping
they
do
that
,
I
was
mad
like
I
was
going
crazy
,
this
was
certainly
not
fair
.
And
I
just
talked
to
my
friend
that
is
also
going
to
Berkeley
and
she
has
to
redo
her
class
pick
entirely
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😲
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
bad
for
her
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
made
something
as
simple
as
picking
classes
so
difficult
.
\
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
wtf
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
insane
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
they
just
lucked
out
because
they
had
an
earlier
time
than
you
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
just
bullshit
(
excuse
my
language
)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
dw
I
was
cussing
all
morning
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
would
throw
hands
too
wtf
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Evil
,
if
they
opened
it
at
once
for
everyone
and
I
didnt
get
it
,
thats
on
me
,
but
there
were
no
openings
to
begin
with
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
likewise
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
are
you
planning
on
sitting
in
waitlist
or
have
you
picked
out
your
last
class
yet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
going
to
rely
on
waitlist
,
I
am
trying
to
pick
one
more
class
that
will
fufill
the
philosophy
or
physical
science
requirement
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
have
you
got
a
class
in
mind
to
fulfill
that
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
I
find
one
and
think
its
good
,
the
seats
are
filled
.

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
English
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
computer

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
if
not
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
then
english
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
like
writing
essays
strangely
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
even
tho
my
grammar
is
terrible
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😅
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
we
writer
buddies
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
should
'
ve
seen
that
one
coming
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
we
should
create
a
story
together
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yooooooo
i
'
d
be
so
down
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
what
kind
of
story
would
it
be
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Horror
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
some
adventure
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
actually
never
dabbled
in
reading
or
writing
horror
books
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
except
like
the
goosebumps
series
back
in
elementary
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
sounds
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
,
but
writing
in
fiction
is
pretty
interesting
,
it
can
be
taken
different
ways
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
mean
it
doesn
'
t
have
to
be
supernatural
,
it
could
be
like
a
michael
myers
situation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
fiction
horror
does
open
more
doors
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
should
think
about
that

[sskarz]
do
you
have
experience
in
reading
or
writing
horror
books
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
tried
writing
but
I
lost
all
those
,
but
I
used
to
read
a
bunch
of
those
goosebump
series
and
short
horror
stories
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
used
to
pick
a
book
with
multiple
short
horror
stories
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
it
was
quick
and
short
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
feel
like
everyone
starts
with
the
goosebump
series
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
have
you
read
IT
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
half
of
it
,
but
like
clowns
arent
scary
to
me
,
so
I
lost
interest
in
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
really
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
absolutely
hate
clowns
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
couldn
'
t
finish
that
book
because
it
was
[sskarz]
1
.
spooky
[sskarz]
2
.
1000
pages
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
...
what
are
you
scared
of
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Spiders
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
if
i
put
a
clown
pic
,
will
you
get
scared
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
not
really
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
but
like
if
u
see
one
,
you
will
get
scared
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
unless
it
is
built
up
,
not
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
would
be
creeped
out
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
if
i
was
walking
a
road
just
barely
lit
up
with
broken
street
lights
and
i
saw
a
silhouette
of
a
clown
,
im
running
the
other
direction
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
see
how
its
built
up
with
the
settings
beforehand
,
that
scares
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
well
if
I
am
walking
with
you
I
will
save
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
if
i
was
just
shown
a
picture
of
a
clown
its
like
eh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
literally
talking
about
bringing
a
foam
spider
last
time
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
was
a
joke
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
...
is
it
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
jk
jk
jk
jk
jk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
LOL
i
was
kidding
too
,
foam
spider
wont
be
too
much
of
an
issue
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
2
foam
spiders
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
now
it
sounds
like
a
good
idea
lmao
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
*
now
before
i
get
my
head
twisted
,
in
legal
terms
this
is
a
joke
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ok
but
other
than
spiders
,
like
a
horror
element
that
scares
you
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
ghosts
,
dead
people
,
etc
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry
went
to
the
bathroom
real
quick
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
other
than
that
,
like
if
someone
is
choking
on
food
,
idk
why
,
I
will
freeze
and
like
freak
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Occasionally
large
bodies
of
water
,
and
being
alone
in
the
middle
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
the
ocean
,
and
being
alone
in
the
middle
......
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
this
sounds
all
too
familiar
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
*
cough
*
submarine
*
cough
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
exactly
,
being
stuck
too
deep
into
water
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
also
because
if
I
get
stuck
in
water
deeper
than
4
feet
,
I
wont
make
it
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
still
got
11
inches
of
head
room
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
enough
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
swim
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
how
about
like
a
stranded
ocean
story
where
the
characters
go
through
the
horrors
of
living
in
the
ocean
alone
without
anything
,
maybe
encounter
an
island
or
something
and
something
scary
lurks
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yep
,
i
used
to
train
back
in
middle
school
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
that
,
it
is
eerie
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
swimming
is
bad
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
never
too
late
to
learn
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
only
be
in
the
water
if
I
can
at
least
tiptoe
on
the
pool
floor
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
easy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
sometime
in
the
future
,
I
will
learn
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
funny
because
my
dad
used
to
train
both
me
and
my
brother
,
but
then
I
was
just
always
scared
and
needed
someone
next
to
me
.
And
I
am
sure
I
would
still
freak
out
if
I
tried
now
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
you
won
'
t
drown
,
just
gotta
paddle
it
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
your
dad
ever
just
launch
you
into
like
an
8
ft
pool
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OH
NAH
,
He
knew
I
couldn
'
t
get
past
5
feet
before
panicking
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
that
how
you
learned
omg
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
gonna
try
if
I
am
ever
in
the
situation
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
dad
literally
threw
me
in
repeatedly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
got
gaslight
every
single
time
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
hope
he
came
after
you
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
after
i
struggled
for
a
bit
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
motto
of
my
life
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
accurate
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
WOW
thats
a
way
to
learn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
cool
though
,
probably
the
first
time
I
have
heard
someone
learn
swimming
straight
from
8
feet
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
my
dad
did
the
same
thing
with
paragliding
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
have
i
told
you
the
story
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
I
am
interested
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Go
on
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
basically
,
this
was
when
the
new
movie
Transformers
3
came
out
,
and
as
you
know
,
i
love
seeing
big
robots
fighting
each
other
,
[sskarz]
and
at
the
time
,
i
was
at
Nepal
,
and
the
movie
had
just
reached
the
theaters
in
Nepal
.
[sskarz]
that
day
,
I
wanted
to
watch
the
movie
,
but
we
ended
up
scaling
a
large
mountain
for
paragliding
,
but
I
really
didn
'
t
want
to
do
it
and
everyone
else
wanted
to
.
[sskarz]
so
at
the
peak
of
the
mountain
,
my
dad
told
me
that
i
could
watch
the
movie
right
after
paragliding
with
everyone
else
,
and
i
took
the
bet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
needless
to
say
it
,
there
was
a
lot
of
screaming
and
i
was
scared
to
death
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
did
get
to
watch
the
movie
the
same
day
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry
that
was
a
very
funny
story
,
how
old
were
you
at
the
time
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
glad
it
was
funny
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
let
me
search
up
when
that
movie
came
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
2011
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
12
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
12
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
probably
12
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
am
assuming
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mathematically
yes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
you
werent
a
baby
baby
,
but
I
can
understand
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
feet
in
the
air
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
go
alone
,
or
with
someone
else
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
was
scared
of
heights
at
the
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
attached
to
the
guy
that
flew
the
paraglider
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
he
steered
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
I
had
that
phase
too
,
I
used
be
scared
when
dad
would
drive
uphill
and
stuff
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
well
at
least
you
didn
'
t
go
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
would
be
fine
doing
that
now
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
d
be
happy
to
go
paragliding
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
why
i
wanna
sky
dive
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
not
scared
of
heights
anymore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
dw
we
all
had
that
phase
,
paragliding
and
skydiving
look
so
fun
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
right
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
lots
of
my
fears
are
gone
because
my
dad
just
threw
me
into
the
danger
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
was
like
,
well
then
it
ain
'
t
that
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
applies
to
like
everything
i
do
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
are
your
biggest
fears
?
apart
from
spiders
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
um
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
always
been
scared
to
be
in
an
elevator
alone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
how
come
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
its
because
I
have
read
and
heard
many
stories
of
death
on
elevators
or
when
it
malfunctions
and
you
are
stuck
in
there
for
good
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
I
am
being
overdramatic
,
but
I
would
rather
walk
up
a
bunch
of
stairs
than
take
it
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
done
it
before
,
it
just
makes
my
heart
beat
faster
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
i
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
scared
more
of
that
little
gap
between
the
floor
and
the
elevator
,
always
thinking
im
gonna
drop
my
phone
in
that
small
gap
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
intrusive
thoughts
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
that
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
ever
been
somewhere
for
the
first
time
and
you
automatically
think
about
what
can
go
wrong
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
easily
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
tho
i
try
not
to
think
too
much
on
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
for
me
its
like
thinking
of
where
the
exits
are
in
every
room
in
case
of
a
shooter
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
usually
look
for
exits
too
or
what
I
have
with
me
that
can
come
in
handy
in
case
something
happens
in
a
situation
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
other
than
spiders
,
drowning
,
someone
choking
,
elevators
,
and
large
bodies
of
water
,
I
dont
think
I
am
too
scared
of
anything
else
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
those
are
somewhat
rare
so
that
'
s
good
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
,
i
'
m
going
to
head
to

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Get

Hey

I
was
looking
through
gmail
and
for
some
reason
couldn
’
t
access
some
accounts
for
books
and
stuff
.
Then
I
was
called
to
eat
and
completely
forgot
to
get
back
to
you
.
But

obviously
going
to

[sskarz]
Hey

re

dw
about
it
,

got
stuff
to
do
and
prepare
for
👍.
Yeah
getting
a
good
overview
for
the
foundation
of
all
the
books
would
be
a
pretty
smart
move
,
considering
you
’
re
probably
going
to
be
writing
a
lot
about
themes
and
motifs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
and
yea
I
appreciate
your
understanding
,
sometimes
I
have
a
bad
habit
of
starting
many
things
at
once
and
like
getting
everything
mixed
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
,
I
know
what
that
feels
like
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
completely
understand
no
need
to
apologize
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
after
dinner
I
was
like

hanging
in
a
chat

not
gonna
reply

.
😅
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

re
on
the
study
grind
tho
,
are
you
feeling
confident
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
,
I
felt
pretty
confident
in
the
beginning
but
now
looking
at
everything
I
am
not
going
to
lie
,
I
feel
a
lot
more
scared
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
think
that
if
I
put
all
those
little
worries
behind
me
,
I
can
probably
pull
through
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Try
not
to
overwhelm
yourself
,

step

by
class
and
I
assure
you

you
’
re
going
to
be
more

fine
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

t

a
lot
of
time
ahead
of
you
so

’
t
try
to
cram
every
bit
of
syllabus
knowledge

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you

Yes

I
will
be
taking
it
little
by
little
so
I
don
'
t
mess
up
anywhere
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
just
that
feeling
that
hits
me
at
the
most
random
time
of
a
day
and
my
brain
goes
"
what
if
this
happens
?"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
get
you
,
it
’
s
hard
to
not
be
thinking
of
those
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
this
is
where
that
positive
mentality
stuff
comes
into
play
big
time
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
gonna
keep
that
in
mind
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
really
goes
a
long
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
at
least
i
think
it
does
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
helped
me
a
lot
during
my
early
college
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
I
am
sure
it
does
,
my
teachers
mention
it
all
the
time
and
I
always
refused
to
believe
that
thinking
positive
will
fix
it
,
but
sometimes
that
helps
a
lot
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
listen
to
your
teachers
,
they
are
right
💯
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
about
like
literally
everything
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
pessimism
gets
you
nowhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
positive
thinking
at
least
gets
you
a
bit
more
confident
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
to
do
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
again
im
no
psychologist
but
im
just
trying
to
say
something
that
worked
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
with
that
kind
of
overwhelming
pressure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
no
psychologist
,
but
you
are
a
teacher
and
I
appreciate
your
positive
and
uplifting
words
and
advice

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

brother
was
like
9
and
my
other
cousin
was
also
9
,
and
after
we
all
had
dinner
,
they
put
my
cousisns
grandparents
,
me
and
my
cousins
in
the
hotel
room
and
went
,
"

will
be

"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We

woke
up
next
morning
,
there
was
literally
no
point
in
taking
us
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
Also

told
to
get
out

'
d
always
get
kicked
out
of
all
the
casinos
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
its
better
to
wait
a
few
years
before
going
there
,
honestly
I
dont
see
a
point
to
go
anytime
soon
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
there
'
s
no
real
point
to
go
to
vegas
unless
you
got
like
a
show
to
watch
or
you
'
re
over
21
[sskarz]

of
a
fan
of
that
kind
of
social
space
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
True
true
,
they
all
stare
at
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
d
rather
stay
home
and
enjoy
a
show
alone
than
going
to
vegas
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Too
social
right

[prabipyakurel]
Yea

an
introvert
I

if
I
am

I
can
be
an
extrovert
,
idk

you
have
ever
felt
that
way
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

social
battery
where

my
friends
or
family
that
i
'
m
familiar
with
i
can
be
very
social
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

zipline
and

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
zipline
has
always

time
I

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So

👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

take
care
of
him

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh

that
dog
sounds
nice
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

a
hotel
while
everyone
else
goes
to
a
casino
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
only
time

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
who
wants
to
be
super
mature
in
life
,

boring
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
being
mature
is
good
for

serious
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
some
people

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
too
many
times
than

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like

inch
in
front
of
the
TV
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
not
having
to

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
physics

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
made
me
a
different
man
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
saw

I
was
like
nah
something
related
to
computers
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Physics
was
never
my
thing
,
I
hated
it
,
all
the
math
included
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
can
relate
so
hard
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
only
enjoyed
playing
with
wires
and
joining
wires
I
wasnt
supposed
to
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
electrical
engineer
hmmmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
could
never
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
d
probably
electrocute
myself
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
knowing
my
brain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
about
that
too
,
but
If
I
get
electrocuted
oh
well
,
Learned
something
new
before
I
died
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
talked
to
u
about
that
being
electrocuted
by
lightning
or
jumping
off
a
cliff
thing
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
cliff
one
yes
,
but
lightning
one
no
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
I
hope
you
were
alright
,
but
tell
me
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
no
it
was
like
a
would
you
rather
kind
of
situation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
you
know
what
,
this
is
perfect
timing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
friend
just
gave
me
a
situation
and
i
'
m
curious
to
what
your
reaction
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
lets
say
you
'
re
transported
3
million
years
into
the
past
.
You
can
only
bring
1
object
and
1
person
with
you
,
and
whatever
is
on
your
body
/
clothes
.
What
are
you
bringing
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
to
survive
obviously
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
object
must
be
from
this
time
(
2023
),
and
the
person
must
be
alive
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
give
me
a
min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
fs
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
a
hard
question
imo
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wait
I
am
just
living
in
the
past
but
can
bring
one
thing
fom
this
era
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
a
cell
phone
,
a
flame
thrower
,
etc
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Object
=
Phone
,
person
=
Elon
musk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
what
'
s
your
reasoning
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
phone
is
like
a
necessity
,
you
can
search
for
stuff
and
I
guess
be
able
to
get
more
resources
out
of
it
.
Elon
musk
because
dude
is
Big
brain
and
will
probably
be
easy
to
work
with
to
help
survive
or
improve
and
advance
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
sure
you
'
re
going
to
have
service
3
million
years
in
the
past
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Object
water
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
was
probably
hard
to
find
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Object
:
Lighter
[sskarz]
Person
:
My
dad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
either
my
dad
or
bear
grylls
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lighter
is
pretty
clever
,
and
your
dad
is
smart
,
great
choices
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
chose
my
dad
so
i
wouldn
'
t
get
lonely
or
go
insane
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
plus
he
'
s
pretty
resourceful
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
I
see
,
yea
a
familiar
face
might
be
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
the
lighter
because
fire
is
enough
to
scare
away
most
predators
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
good
survival
instincts
,
I
would
have
died
with
the
dumb
cellphone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
you
just
didn
'
t
think
about
it
for
too
long
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
sat
and
talked
to
my
friend
about
it
for
like
30
minutes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
can
be
that
too
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
30
min
,
what
an
intellectual
conversation
that
must
have
been
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
god
no
we
started
derailing
quickly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
started
deconstructing
the
definition
of
an
object
to
squeeze
out
the
most
insane
things
to
bring
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ultimately
,
my
friend
chose
a
planet
the
size
of
mars
to
implode
and
he
worked
his
way
to
define
it
as
an
"
object
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
most
certaintly
not
an
intellectual
conversation
,
more
so
how
much
can
you
get
away
with
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
him
he
will
be
the
next
Elon
musk
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
elon
musk
is
a
smart
business
man
,
idk
how
he
would
do
in
a
scenario
being
in
the
past
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
yea
there
is
that
but
he
is
like
always
coming
up
with
crazy
inventions
and
ways
to
advance
the
world
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
i
'
m
on
the
fence
with
that
guy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
appreciate
his
efforts
towards
a
better
future
for
the
human
race
,
at
the
same
time
he
has
some
nasty
practices

from
mines
worked
by

and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
which
isn
'
t
like
directly
his
fault
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
supporting
that
kind
of
stuff
idk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
just
some
questionable
decisions
on
the
business
side
of
things
,
and
his
political
views
that
i
don
'
t
agree
with
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
True

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
literal
go
to

to
any
restaraunt
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
lemonade
or
a
variation
of
lemonade
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lemonade
is
just
simple
and
great
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
the
strawberry
acai
from
starbucks
used
to
be
my
favorite
drink
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
its
available
everywhere

,
I
have
tried
the
pink
drink
and
it
’
s
okay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Starbucks
is
the
most
beautiful
place
that
could
exist
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
pink
drink
i
think
is
with
coconut
milk
which
is
why
it
doesn
'
t
really
taste
like
lemonade
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]

good
rubbing
the
celebration
of
defeat
on
someone
younger
than
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

of
older
siblings
do
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
couldn
'
t
be
me
,
im
the
youngest
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
dont
even
understand
how
good
that
feels
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
like
something
you
can
brag
about
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
mention
their
failure
at
random
times
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you

re
an
actual
menace
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
sister

[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
rule

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
stop
until
i
end
on
a
win
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
then
i
can
always
get
back
at
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
and
especially
if
I
beat
someone
in
a
game
and
I
don
'
t
know
how
to
play
that
game
well
,
That
is
the
last
time
I
am
playing
against
that
person
.
I
shall
forever
remain
the
winner
.
[prabipyakurel]

️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

,
oooo
when
I
beat
someone
I
am
like
"
we
are
not
doing
any
type
of
rematch
!"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
especially
if
they
'
re
better
than
me
at
that
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
i
have
a
friend
that
is
insanely
good
at
this
game
,
and
i
can
never
win
against
him
for
the
life
of
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
did
squeeze
out
a
win
when
he
handicapped
himself
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
that
was
the
last
time
i
went
against
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
like
if
I
went
up
against
you
at
chess
or
something
and
by
some
miracle
I
beat
you
,
that
is
it
,
we
are
not
touching
chess
again
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
i
just
gotta
keep
winning
so
we
can
keep
playing

[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Smart

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
there
is
a
really
cool
version
called
mathle
i

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
like
you
have
to
guess
the
equation
and
output
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
requires
a
lot
of
thought
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
I
know
what
that
game
is
,
my
friend
tony
would
open
it
up

look
at
me
knowing
I
didn
'
t
know
how
to
play
,
and
went
you
wanna

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

dumb
moves
I

when

games
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
that
'
s
with

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
no
brain
cells
and
don
'
t
know
what
I
did
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
,
i
should
'
ve
mentioned
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
based
on
'
openings
'
in
chess
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
first
few
moves
in
a
chess
game
always
have
some
kind
of
name
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
you
have
to
guess
the
first
few
moves
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
not
go
back
to
try
that
,
I
am
going
to
stick
to
playing
SODOKU
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
still
don
'
t
know
how
to
play
sudoku
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
looks
so
complicated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
numbers
be
scaring
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
its
simple
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
adding
numbers
or
something
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
have
no
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
so
basically
you
have
a
grid
where
you
need
to
put
numbers
from
1
-
9
vertically
and
horizontally
,
but
cant
put
the
same
number
if
it
has
already
been
in
that
row
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
here
there
are
9
boxes
and
within
each
boxes
,
each
number
is
only
there
once
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
if
you
see
the
vertical
and
horizontal
rows
all
of
them
range
from
1
-
9
but
dont
repeat
numbers
in
the
same
row
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
does
it
only
apply
for
the
3x3
boxes
or
the
entire
9x9
box
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
3x3
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
try
it
on
the
app
,
I
learned
red
it
that
way
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
ok
that
is
acutally
simpler
than
what
i
thought
it
was
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
must
be
a
pro
at
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
worry
If
I
can
play
,
you
can
master
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
just
play
for
fun
,
it
makes
you
think
sometimes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
gotta
flex
that
brain
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
imagine
going
up
to
someone
and
going
hi
nice
to
meet
you
I
play
SODOKU
for
fun
,
I
swear
that
person
is
gonna
walk
in
the
opposite
direction
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
i
think
its
pretty
cool
that
you
play
sudoku
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
like
doing
it
,
then
that
'
s

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

much
my
outlook
on
that
kind
of
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
,
means
a
lot
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
don
'
t
diss
on
people
'
s
hobbies
,
like
if
you
like
doing
something
,
as
long
as
its
not
illegal
or
ethically
/
morally
wrong
,
then
that
'
s
all
good
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
do
you
think
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
yes
I
couldn
'
t
have
agreed
with
you
more
,
I
respect
people
for
the
talent
they
have
,
I
believe
that
no
talent
is
too
small
.
However
,
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
world
that
make
fun
of
people
for
some
hobbies
and
I
personally
don
'
t
like
those
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
they
worked
hard
on
getting
to
a
certain
point
and
who
are

to
judge
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
exactly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hobbies
define
what
people
enjoy
and
that
'
s
what
makes
us
unique
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
its
like
how
you
play
the
drums
and
chess
and
it
is
something
that
you
enjoy
.
I
respect
you

that
,

listen
to
what

else
says
,
someone
always
has
something
negative
to
say
in
my
opinion
.

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
hope

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
At
the

but
if
addresses

it
might
be
mountain

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
as
long
as
you
have
someone
living
in
that
area

times
,
when
you
have
stuff

decide
not

do
them
.
[prabipyakurel]

To

[sskarz]
Not

thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
’
s
an
honest
mood
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
like
online
classes
all
over
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
just
play
the
video
on
a
split
screen
and
do
my
thing
on
the
other
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
they
make
us
do
those
things
like
every
semester
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
At
this
point
I

memorized
all
the
answers
from
the
previous
times
I
’
ve
taken
them
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
yea
sometimes
some
things
seem
like
they
are
on
repeat
and
you
know
what
will
happen
next
everytime
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
definition
of
a
pattern
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
feeling
anymore
ready
for
the
big
move
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
still
taking
time
to
process
that
its
actually
going
to
happen
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
imagine
I
die
tomorrow
and
it
doesnt
end
up
happening
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
please
don
’
t
think
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
not
healthy
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
ik
ik
,
but
sometimes
I
can
convince
myself
that
its
in
the
same
state
,
nothing
too
big
,
and
sometimes
my
brain
is
like
you
are
not
going
to
survive
there
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
got
the
angel
and
devil
on
the
shoulder
kind
of
situation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
fr
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
know
realistically
I
think
it
may
take
some
time
for
you
to
adjust
to
the
new
lifestyle
but
everyone
eventually
does
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
once
I
get
there
,
I
will
understand
that
its
not
as
bad
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
just
homesickness
I
think
is
what
might
be
difficult
,
how
far
is
Berkeley
from
here
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
7
hours
,
on
drive
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
jeez
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
like
San
Francisco
drive
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
’
s
nuts
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
never
thought
it
was
that
far
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Berkleley
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
oakland
side
bridge
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
North
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
While
San
Francisco
is
on
the
opposite
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
,
yes
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Dang
that
drive
is
gonna
feel
like
a
slog
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Are
you
motion
sick
like
in
long
drives
or
on
planes
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
,
we
are
going
to
SF
saturday
to
check
out
the
school
and
with
this
weather
,
I
can
already
imagine
the
car
ride
there
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
planes
,
havent
been
on
too
many
plane
rides
to
feel
those
,
but
car
rides
,
when
I
was
little
I
could
not
be
in
a
car
or
a
bus
,
like
I
felt
sick
and
threw
up
instantly
.
When
I
was
in
Nepal
and
we
needed
to
go
somewhere
on
taxi
or
bus
,
I
needed
medication
to
not
throw
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
as
bad
now
,
but
sometimes
it
still
feels
bad
on
long
drives
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
I
gotcha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
definitely
keep
some
of
that
medication
on
hand
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Me
not
so
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
depends
on
who
’
s
driving
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
dont
use
it
anymore
,
but
I
just
fall
asleep
if
I
feel
sick
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
the
driver
does
sharp
breaks
or
like
sharp
turns
every
time
then
I
get
sick
very
easily
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
if
they
drive
relatively
normal
and
smooth
,
it
’
s
no
problem
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
those
are
terrible
especially
on
curvy
roads
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
easier
to
be
with
someone
who
drives
smooth
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
you
know
how
some
people
only
break
right
before
they
hit
the
car
in
front
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Instead
of
rolling
it
to
a
stop
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Those
people
make
me
sick
so
easily
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
always
avoid
those
,
I
am
a
new
driver
and
stop
very
slowly
and
far
away
,
like
to
the
point
where
my
dad
shakes
his
head
and
goes
,
"
an
entire
car
can
fit
in
the
space
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahahaha
I
get
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
used
to
do
the
same
but
I
’
ve
gotten
a
lot
more
confident
over
the
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
How
long
have
you
had
your
license
for
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
got
it
on
halloween
last
year
,
I
specifically
remember
because
I
told
my
instructor
,
"
thank
you
,
and
happy
halloween
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
I
get
used
to
driving
a
little
more
normally
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Please
tell
me
you
did
the
test
with
a
costume
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
to
nervous
to
do
anything
of
that
sort
,
I
forgot
it
was
Halloween
midway
through
the
test
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
would
’
ve
been
so
funny
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Was
your
instructor
nice
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
yes
he
was
actually
and
I
remember
I
did
this
turn
a
bit
too
fast
and
his
phone
fell
into
that
little
space
behind
the
seat
belt
buckle
area
and
I
was
like
"
oh
no
,
this
is
it
,
I
am
done
!"
I
kept
saying
sorry
and
he
was
like
no
worries
,
keep
going
.
He
eventually
got
it
out
in
a
while
and
was
not
too
mad
about
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
OOOO
the
first
instructor
that
I
had
he
was
all
grumpy
and
scary
and
was
kind
of
mean
.
I
also
forgot
a
speed
bump
and
that
was
my
first
mistake
with
him
,
he
gave
up
after
I
have
more
than
15
mistakes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhh
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
you
hit
the
swerve
a
little
too
hard
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
do
you
drive
with
both
hands
on
the
wheel
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
are
you
those
that
put
one
hand
down
,
and
only
use
one
to
drive
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yep
that
’
s
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
arms
are
pretty
long
so
having
both
out
on
a
hinge
tires
my
arms
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
lol
it
scares
me
when
someone
drives
like
that
,
honestly
wish
I
had
it
in
me
to
do
that
but
there
is
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
I
am
tiny
and
have
short
arms
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
trust
me
everyone
gets
to
that
point
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well
you
can
just
put
the
seat
up
further
and
achieve
the
same
effect
,
I
have
my
left
arm
driving
at
7
or
8
position
usually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
professional
advice
btw
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
most
definitely
better
to
have
both
hands
on
the
wheel
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
with
how
much
my
seat
already
had
to
move
forward
,
I
really
cannot
move
it
any
closer
to
the
wheel
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Now
I
really
wanna
see
you
drive
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
should
be
in
a
car
with
me
,
you
will
be
in
the
back
and
will
have
to
like
pull
yourself
forward
to
talk
to
me
face
to
face
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
so
that
’
s
something
I
definitely
need
to
see
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
usually
have
my
seat
leaned
to
the
max
setting
so
I
wonder
what
that
would
look
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Someday
,
not
anytime
soon
,
but
someday
we
can
go
on
a
short
drive
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
god
its
like
the
opposite
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
being
5
’
10
”
has
its
nuances
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
still
look
short
in
the
seat
tho
,
my
legs
are
just
too
long
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
One
more
inch
and
you
will
officially
be
a
feet
taller
than
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
genetics
going
on
overdrive
rn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Maybe
I
just
need
to
drink
more
milk
🤔
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
what
all
nepali
mothers

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It

just
a
straight
up
lie

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Bone
density
doesn
’
t
have
anything
to
do
with
increasing
your
height
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Unless
you
cut
open
your
leg
and
put
metal
rods
between
your
bones
and
extend
that
length
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Which
I
still
can
’
t
wrap
my
head
around
why
someone
would
want
to
do
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
would
anyone
want
to
do
that
?

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
a
very
relatable
feeling
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Feels
good
to
get

at
the
other
person
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
sometimes
she
reminds

of
an
angry
chihuahua

way

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
She

An

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
If

you
would
instantly
understand
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
love
meeting
someone
the
same
height
as
me
and
talking
about
those
other
tall
people
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
“
The
giants
that
roam
amongst
us
”
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wish
you
watched
attack
on
titan
,
you
would
get
that
reference
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
god

my
brother
would
watch
that
soo
much
,
a
lot
of
my
friends
and
one
of
my
teachers
too
,
she
was
giving
away
attack
on
titan
posters
to
anyone
that
wanted
one
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
a
great
show
,
some
of
the
best
story
telling
of
our
generation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
probably
the
most
popular
anime
in
the
entire
world
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
this
thing
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
have
heard
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
how
I
be
seeing
everyone
around
me
ngl
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
is
one
of
the
titans
yes
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
I
think
that
there
are
also
red
ones
if
I
am
not
wrong
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Uhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
technically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
’
d
just
have
to
watch
to
understand
but
it
is
an
anime
soooooo
idk
if
you
will
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
do
be
peak
story
telling
tho
I
’
ll
say
that
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
am
ever
in
the
mood
for
anime
,
if
,
then
maybe
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
so
I
’
ll
take
that
as
a
never
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Kind
of
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
read
a
description
of
the
thing
though
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
story
is
ending
this
year
I
believe
ironically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
okay
did
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
After
like
a
decade
of
airing
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Only
like
4
seasons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
people
talka
about
it
a
lot
,
seems
to
be
watched
by
many
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
good
reason
I
’
d
say
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
the
first
episode
in
a
nutshell
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Plot
seems
pretty
interesting
,
It
would
be
nice
if
they
made
an
actual
show
with
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Trust
me
this
can
only
work
in
animation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Again
a
very
good
reason
behind
that
as
well
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
yea
after
a
year
of
my
friends
using
random
memes
from
this
anime
,
I
got
to
know
that
it
was
called
attack
on
titans
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
at
least
you
got
the
name
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
,
something
is
better
than
nothing
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ok
but
do
you
just
not
like
anime
,
or
all
animation
in
general
?
Just
curious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
maybe
animation
in
general
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
just
the
concepts
of
anime
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
even
when
I
tried
watching
the
1st
episode
of
nauto
with
my
brother
,
I
just
kinda
tuned
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Naruto
is
uh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
kinda
mid
im
ngl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
loved
it
as
a
kid
but
when
I
look
back
at
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
was
good
just
not
like
the
greatest
like
people
say
it
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
show
seems
kind
weird
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
not
that
it
’
s
weird
,
it
just
take
a
while
for
it
to
really
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
tho
u
might
think
the
premise
of
the
show
is
weird
which
I
can
understand
where
you
’
re
coming
from
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
maybe
,
or
maybe
its
because
I
don
'
t
give
my
time
to
understand
an
amine
and
when
I
watch
the
first
episode
and
am
not
interested
,
I
assume
I
will
not
be
interested
through
out
the
rest
of
the
episodes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
fair
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
do
the
same
with
like
every
show
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
was
randomly
looking
through
insta
and
saw
this
,
I
need
to
save
this
in
case
I
come
across
a
bug
in
my
dorm
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
already
see
you
typing
out
this
email
in
the
future
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ikr
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
At
least
being
some
form
of
bug
spray
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
a
gas
mask
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
gonna
help
trust
me
,
I
am
jumping
out
the
window
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
way
you
do
have
a
way
to
defend
yourself
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
pray
your
dorm
mate
is
brave
enough
then
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🙏
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
praying
too
lol
or
someone
down
the
hallway
that
can
get
it
out
for
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
does
the
fear
of
bugs
also
extend
to
like
those
kids
shows
where
the
main
character
is
like
a
bug
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Uh
nah
not
cartoons
,
spiders
are
still
an
issue
but
other
bugs
are
fine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhh
ok
so
like
charlottes
web
is
a
no
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont

its
dead
dead
,
I
am
not
going
to
be
anywhere
near
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
you
were
asked
to
defeat
a
spider
with
nothing
but
your
hands
for
a
chance
of
1
trillion
dollars
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Would
you
do
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Never

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For

but
like
how
do
you
see
it
and
not
scream
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like

8
legs
and
crawls
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
a
tiny
spider
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Top
of
the
food
chain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
one
of
those
that
are
the
size
of
a
pushpin
,
that
is
enough
to
get
me
out
of
the
room
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Or
I
just
vacuum
then
and
they
just
get
squished
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Can
do
that
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
literally
cry
in
a
corner
and
wait
for
someone
to
come
get
it
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Dang

have
pretty
crazy
arachnophobia
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

pretty
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That

spaces
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
No

of
thing

Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

’
s
crazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Once
I
check
for
bugs
and
remove
the
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
of
course
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
This
might
be
one
of
the
quickest
days
I
’
ve
ever
experienced
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
can
’
t
believe
it
’
s
already
8
pm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
mind
is
boggled
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
days
are
like
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Can
’
t
do
this
again
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
time
flies
by
fast
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
are
motivated
to
do
other
things
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
this
one
time
I
had
math
homework
and
a
presentation
over
the
weekend
and
I
just
didn
'
t
have
it
in
me
to
start
on
math
,
and
I
looove
presentations
and
putting
slides
together
,
so
I
went
with
that
and
finished
like
10
-
15
slides
that
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
time
flew
by
fast
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
today
i
just
didn
'
t
want
to
do
anything
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
haven
'
t
felt
like
that
in
a
while
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
be
like
that
sometimes
i
guess
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
its
summer
too
,
so
some
days
are
like
dead
slow
and
other
days
are
like
what
did
I
even
do
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
you
get
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
When
I
used
to
be
bored
sometimes
I
used
to
make
like
bracelets
with
crochets
,
I
dont
know
if
you
have
.
Miss
those
days
,
I
was
gonna
do
it
today
,
but
I
just
ended
up
not
doing
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
never
tried
making
a
bracelet
with
crochet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
sounds
pretty
cool
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
pattern
is
pretty
fun
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
when
did
you
learn
to
make
them
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
like
these
,
I
forgot
what
they
were
called
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
learned
them
at
my
elementary
school
'
s
afterschool
program
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Then
got
one
of
my
own
little
mushrooms
and
hooks
and
tried
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oooooooh
that
looks
neat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
only
know
one
pattern
but
it
takes
away
stress
sometimes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
do
not
know
how
to
like
crochet
big
things
or
knit
like
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
always
thought
knitting
was
complicated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
looks
like
you
can
mess
up
so
easily
without
focus
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
makes
my
brain
hurt
too
,
the
mushroom
is
easy
tho
I
was
able
to
do
it
as
a
child
so
its
pretty
simple
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

of
the
movie
during
a
chase
scene
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
are
they
going
to
let
everyone

or
thats
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
U
still
waiting
outside
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
This
is
like
worst
case
scenario
rn
,
I
had
a
meeting
planned
for
7
and
the
movie
would
’
ve
ended
on
that
hour
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
just
want
a
refund
now
and
come
back
later
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
,
can
the
meeting
be
moved
or
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Unfortunately
it
’
s
a
mandatory
meeting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
should
give
you
like
at
least
half
the
money
back
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
have
to
attend
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
hope
I
get
the
full
refund
but
we
’
ll
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🍀
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
maybe
they
will
let
you
in
soon
and
it
will
end
around
6
:
30
/
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
chance
,
the
length
of
the
movie
wouldn
’
t
allow
it
to
end
on
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
then
its
probably
a
good
idea
to
head
home
and
come
back
tomorrow
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
can
watch
it
over
in
peace

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

check
if
they

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Weather

people
of
that
region
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'

!
I
'
d
love
to
see
pictures
of
the
campus
if
you
do
take
some
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
for
sure
,
I
will
be
like
snapping
each
building
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Gotta
remember
so
my
little
self
doesn
'
t
get
lost
when
I
get
there
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
me
go
listen
to
a
totally
different
lecture
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Do
it
!
Pretend
you
’
re
already
a
student
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
See
what
it
’
s
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wonder
if
you
’
ll
be
in
a
lecture
hall
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
already
know
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
,
probably
,
not
too
sure
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Imma
walk
in
like
I
already
rule
the
school
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Do
you
like
the
idea
of
taking
classes
in
a
lecture
hall
opposed
to
a
regular
classroom
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Hell
yeahhhhhhh
you
deserve
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
prefer
smaller
classes
and
more
intimate
teaching
sessions
where
I
get
to
participate
and
be
able
to
ask
questions
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
if
it
is
a
lecture
halls
,
I
will
probably
use
the
office
hours
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Same
,
never
was
a
fan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
way
harder
to
ask
questions
and
also
hear
the
professor
at
times
imo
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
,
and
I
don
'
t
want
to
be
a
teachers
pet
or
anything
but
I
like
it
when
the
professor
knows
my
name
and
will
actually
listen
to
my
questions
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Gotta
get
teachers
for
future
rec
.
letters
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yup
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
if
thats
only
me
though
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
I
do
the
same
thing
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
got
one
from
my
cs
professor
of
last
semester
actually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
he
/
she
probably
wrote
like
5
pages
about
how
great
of
a
student
you
are
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
better
to
be
interactive
with
the
professor
and
rack
up
those
recommendations
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Uhhuh
no
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
got
a
very
nice
letter
that
said
I
listened
and
participated
often
and
did
well
in
the
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Which
I
will
take
pride
of
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
!
you
are
like
5
steps
ahead
of
everyone
in
there
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mmmm
idk
some
people
in
there
out

like
geniuses
since
the
day
they
were
conceived
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
those
people
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

many
people
,
there
are
people
out
there

hardest

their
own
way
,
weather
its
with
a
hobby
,
talent
,
or
academics
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
at
the
end
of
the
day
I
’
d
rather
be
a
hard
working
normal
person
than
a
lazy
genius
lol

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
actually
sleep
to
this
playlist
as
well
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
either
that
or
Mac
Miller
'
s
Circles
album
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
for
the
past
like
2
years
,
i
'
ve
programmed
my
brain
to
just
fall
asleep
quicker
with
music
from
my
phone
speaker
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
just
quiet
enough
to
not
disrupt
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
how
it
started
but
its
just
like
that
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
yea
I
tried
that
once
and
forgot
to
turn
off
the
music
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
in
the
morning
my
phone
was
like
on
the
floor
,
and
I
realized
that
that
was
a
bad
idea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
need
a
timer
on
the
music
because
I
sleep
through
like
the
1st
to
2nd
song
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
get
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
except
it
just
keeps
going
till
the
morning
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ooooooooh
wanna
try
something
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
that
happens
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
??
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
there
'
s
this
thing
called
a
spotify
pie
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
never
heard
of
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
so
it
shows
like
a
bunch
of
genres
and
artists
that
you
'
ve
listened
to
over
your
spotify
account
'
s
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
let
me
show
you
mine
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
the
pie
chart
represents
the
genres
i
listen
to
the
most
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
the
artists
from
top
to
bottom
represent
which
ones
i
listen
to
the
most
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
it
just
keeps
going
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Where

that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

'
t

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

moments
ever
for
me
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
listen
to
a
lot
of
variety
,
outside
of
hiphop
and

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Nice

[prabipyakurel]
What

to
you
during
2021
,
if
I
may

?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

comfortable
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
you
'
re

!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i

went
through
a
breakup
that
was
rough
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
definitely
not
a
good
one
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
comfortable
talking
about
stuff
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
a
rough
time
of
being
confused
emotionally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ultimately
things
just
did
not
work
out
and
it
was
like
fireworks
for
a
month
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
got
back
on
my
feet
soon
enough
,
turned
my
mentality
around
and
i
'
ve
been
so
much
better
since
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
I
feel
so
bad
,
but
things
get
better
overtime
,
just
focus
on
yourself
and
everything
will
work
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

what
i
did
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
friend
also
went
through
in
a
traumatic
way
and
I
have
not
been
in
any
relationships
to
give
advice
but
you
are
an
amazing
person
and
sometimes
universe
tells
you
to
let
people
go
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Again
,
not
a
professional
person
to
take
advice
from
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
don
'
t
worry
,
you
'
re
saying
all
the
right
things
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
agree
with
everything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
doesn
'
t
bother
me
anymore
,

so
much
from
that
experience
,
and
now
i
'
m
just
all
the
more
wiser
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But

giving

50
treats
convinces
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

namaste

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not

,
but

as
a
stranger
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
used
to
be
all
over
him
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
feel
like
once
you
see
a
dog
for
a
while
,
you
get
used
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
just
don
’
t
give
any
dog
a
chance
or
myself
to
get
near
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
you
come
over
,
I
'
ll
help
you
slowly
warm
up
to
bear
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

looks
vicious
but
he
'
s
like
the
kindest
mischeavous
soul
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Seems
really
cute
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
once
you

used
to
them
,
it
becomes
alot
easier
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
how
to
explain
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

just
gravitate
to
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

stairs
when

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
wait
for
someone
to
pick
them
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
personally
not
the
biggest
fan
of
that
breed
simply
becasue
as
a
kid
,
back
at
my
old
house
,
this
neighbor
i
lived
next
to
had
like
5
of
them
,
and
they
'
d
all
start
yapping
at
the
crack
of
dawn
or
in
the
middle
of
the
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
awwwww

is
cute
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl

their
barks

sharp

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

a
good
way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

to
sit
and
the
other
keeps
messing
with
him

boring

we
had
to
go
line
by
line
of
the
20
+
page
constitution
to
change
wording
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

and
texted
back
and

passed
out

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
the
trip
was
amazing
,
we
came
back
through
the
beach
area
on
the
101
freeway
and
the
scenes
were
like
so
beautiful
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oooooooooh

the
drive
right
next
to
the
beach

come
through
the
car
windows

to
be
one
of
my
favorites
of
all
time
[sskarz]

2016
-
2018
were
crazy
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
had
some
absolute
classics
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

long
time
since
I
'
ve
played
chess
so
brain
muscle
memory
kicked
in
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
a
game
about
pattern
recognition
,
so
as
soon
as
you
see
one
of
those
that
you
recognize
,
its
a
lot
easier
to
act
on
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
that
makes
any
sense
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
my
brain
doesnt
work
when
playing
that
game
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
just
gotta
do
chess
puzzles
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
get
that
pattern
recognition
burned
into
your
brain
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
its
like
you
feel
like
a
genius
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
quite
a
feeling
that
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
having
that
eureka
moment
over
and
over
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
dopamine
intensive
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

hour
away
from

,
(
about
the
time
when
I
sent
those
marvelous
cow
pictures
),
we
were
driving
at
a
pretty
constant
normal
freeway
rate
.
And
this
guy
in
a
white
honda
came
next
to
us
,
flipped
us
off
,
looked
at
my
dad
and
drove
in
font
of
him
.
GOd
damn
I
was
about
to
do
the
same
but
my
parents
said
no
.
Then
there
was
traffic
so
that
guy
got
stuck
wayyyyy
behind
us
.
That
was
karma

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea

now
,
when
I

to
double
check
mirror
,
seats
and
everything
before
heading
off
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
that
'
s
always
important
,
i
do
the
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
like
i
mean
getting
uesd
to
roads
you
recognize
and
like
driving
in
LA
and
how
everything
is
a
one
way
street
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
stuff
is
scary
at
first
but
you
get
used
to
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
have
to
put
everything
in
the
car
the
same
for
my
aprents
to
drive
as
well
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
,
its
going
to
take
some
practice
to
be
able
to
make
quick
road
decisions
driving
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
used
to
have
a
really
bad
habit
panicking
when
i
used
to
drive
early
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
if
someone
came
too
close
to
me
in
the
freeway
and
edging
into
my
lane
,
i
would
like
immediately
turn
to
the
other
lane
without
checking
and
so
many
times
that
could
'
ve
gone
wrong
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
try
to
stay
calm
at
all
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
if
what
i
said
helps
sat
all
but
just
from
my
experience
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
i
do
that
on
normal
roads
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
especially
when
i
drive
pass
a
bus
that
is
picking
up
people
and
merges
back
into
the
lane
next
to
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
i
hate
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
hate
busses
in
general
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
helps
,
I
am
always
freaking
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
or
one
of
those
cars
that
merge
in
without
their
signals
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
A
tesla
did
that
last
time
and
I
was
so
mad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
always
the
teslas
and
the
BMWs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
always
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
...
do
you
do
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
im
a
turn
signaler
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
super
important
to
do
that
,
and
its
not
like
its
super
hard
to
do
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
just
something
i
picked
up
on
as
i
drove
around
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ik
thats
what
I
said
,
some
cars
act
like
those
dont
even
exist
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
like
the
tail
gating
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
BMWs
especially
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
just
wanna
drive
100
on
a
30
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
right
,
they
beep
when
I
am
driving
normally
and
refuse
to
just
go
in
front
of
me
using
the
other
lane
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
intrusive
thoughts
:
hard
brake
and
make
them
hit
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
but
then
they
damage
your
car
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
when
someone
is
going
too
slow
in
front
of
you
and
have
the
urge
to
like
"
should
I
just
rear
end
this
thing
to
make
it
move
faster
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
exactly
the
reason
why
its
intrusive
thoughts
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
...
yes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
intrusive
thoughts
will
never
get
to
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hopefully
never
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
pray
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
one
of
my
big
ones
is
dropping
my
phone
into
that
slight
gap
between
a
floor
and
an
elevator
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
everytime
i
think
about
it
but
i
have
to
resist
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
think
about
that
too
,
or
like
anywhere
with
a
gap
to
be
specific
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
keys
on
top
of
a
drain
area
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
intrusive
thoughts
got
me
my
scar
so
i
learned
my
lesson
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

bear
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
just
a
dumb
idiot
in
a
dumb
makeshift
water
park
that
looked
like
it
was
held
together
with
glue
and
duct
tape
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
who
knows
:
think
:
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
tripped
and
fell
into
a
water
slide
made
of
metal
and
really
fast
water
,
so
much
so
that
the
water
cut
my
cheek
clean
and
the
wound
was
kind
of
deep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
place
is
now
no
longer
operating
obviously
but
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
god
,
were
you
under
parent
supervision
or
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
i
was
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
whole
family
saw
it
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

i
was
like
zooming
into
this
emoji
thingy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
oooooooo
yikes
,
it
probably
hurt
a
lot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
actually
quite
the
opposite
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
didn
'
t
even
notice
my
cheek
was
cut
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
fr
thought
that
your
dog
slapped
you
and
you
ended
up
with
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
could
give
me
a
second
one
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
would
probably
be
messy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lets
not
encourage
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

,
you
were
just
like

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

went
down
the
slide
and
came
out
the
small
pool
at
the
end
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
was
going
for
round

corner
of
my

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm

the
best
butter

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

get
some
sort
of
nepali

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Did

have
a
favorite
at

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
there
was
this
one
breakfast
place
and
it
was
right
next
to
the
view
of
the
Eiffel
Tower
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
that
was
really
good
for
the
first
time
having
breakfast
food
in
Paris
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
all
the
restaurants
eventually
felt
like
they
all
tasted
the
exact
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
view
sounds
lovely
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

like
the
home
of
chocolates
.
That
is
my
#
1
reason
and

to
die
for
.
The
greenlands
and
some
of
them
have
ziplines
and
bungee
jumping
places

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg

peak

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
not
a
lot
of
buildings
and
people
,
just
simple
scenery
and
peacefulness
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
then
you
would
choose
a
cabin
in
the
woods
with
a
lake
over
the
city
life
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
pretty
much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
am
going
to
go
to
a
place
to
take
in
the
scenery
,
it
better
not
be
like
looking
out
the
vegas
hotel
window
and
seeing
buildings
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
I
agree
with
you
on
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
We

[sskarz]
In
terms

on
earth
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
d
say
Tokyo
or
Singapore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Because
of
the
culture
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
those
places
sound

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
those
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
For
Singapore
I
’
d
say
because
of
the
many
many
cultures
that
reside
in
that
country
,
like
one
big
melting
pot
and
also
it
’
s
beautiful
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
Tokyo
I
’
d
say
because
I
love
Japanese
food
and
their
culture
and
they
have
so
many
beautiful
cherry
blossom
trees
and
temples
that
I
’
d
love
to
explore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
true
,
singapore
is
so
beautiful
,
I
wanna
visit
a
lot
of
asian
countries
and
try
on
their
clothes
and
learn
more
about
their
traditions

[prabipyakurel]
I
wanna
experience
it

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That

to
think
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If

then
I

a
heartbeat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well

A

To

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

the
first
moon
landing

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Have

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

But

t

about
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or

interesting
but
I
’
ve
never
dove
deep
into
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
are
constitution
related
but
what
they

get
there
is

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Wasn

t
there
a
president
that

like
a
pet
grizzly
bear
or

one
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
may

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
at
the
gym
earlier
in
the
morning
and
I
think
their
fans
stopped
working
so
everyone
started
sweating
like
crazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Youtube
is
fun
,
have
you
ever
watched
a
video
late
at
night
and
its
funny
,
but
you
can
'
t
laugh
because
you
will
wake
others
so
you
do
that
silent
laugh
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

,
the
fan
really
gave
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm

to
try
not
to
laugh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
was
like
a
hot
sandstorm
levels
of
heat
in
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
like
how
when
summer
started
around
June
,
it
was
cold
and
stuff
and
now
that
its
almost
over
,
it
is
like
"
lets
make
this
weather
hotter
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
it
was
like
gloomy
for
like
a
few
weeks
straight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
it

a
couple
days

rain
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
miss
the
rain
so
much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
it
can
be
inconvenient
,
but
it
feels
sooo
good
to
just
walk
out
when
its
raining
and
staying
inside
at
the
same
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Unrelated
but
when
I
saw
this
I
thought
about
how
you
need
this
for
bugs
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Frrrr
rain
is
the
best
weather
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
need
this
fr
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Even
with
this
I
would
be
doing
it
from
a
mile
away
from
the
bug
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
really
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
will
*
probably
*
kill
it
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
that
and
anyone
else
within
the
radius
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

dorm
building

Well

a
possibility

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ok
I
have
a
dumb
question
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
you
got
into
a
scenario
where
you
have
to
stand
before
court
,
and
let
’
s
say
you
’
re
a
lawyer
,
can
you
appoint
yourself
as
your
own
lawyer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
hmmmm
that
is
a
good
question

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don

what
its
about
though
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
popular
because
it
’
s
directed
by
Christopher
Nolan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
the
story
and
development
of
the
first
atom
bomb
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
wondered
how
they
did
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
split
an
atom
and
kaboom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
simple
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
a
3
hour
movie
so
I
’
m
gonna

a
good
while
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Praying

more
fire
alarms

lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeahhh

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

else
other

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You

the
ceiling

a
bit
and
think
about
life
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

’
s
a
staple
before
every
night
to

"

"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That

made
specifically
for
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

try
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
let
me
know
how
you
like
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
when
I
put
music
on
from
a
playslit
,
I
just
let
it
go
because
I
am
too
lazy
to
keep
choosing
the
ones
I
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
will
just
discover
some
good
songs
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Do
you
have
Spotify
premium
btw
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
,
just
regular
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
do
the
student
plan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
asking
because
there
’
s
a
cool
feature
where
you
can
listen
along
with
someone
at
the
same
time
and
add
songs
to
listen
to
together
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
actually
i
have
heard
that
you
can
connect
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
really
?
I
’
ve
never
tried
it
so
idk
how
it
would
work
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
sure
,
but
friends
have
done
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
they
have
premium
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
sounds
pretty
neat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Because
I
only
listen
to
music
when
I
clean
or
have
like
a
hands
on
project
,
or
putting
some
thing
together
,
I
cant
do
schoolwork
with
music
on
,
I
need
silence
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Do

listen
to

the
mood
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
doesn
’
t
distract
me
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
cant
be
listening
to
anything
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Especially
when
I
am
reading
a
book
or
smething
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

that
tho
,
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh

I
can
’
t
read
papers
or
books
with
music

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

getting
the
words
mixed
up
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
the
wrong
thing
when
I
listen
and
read
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
write
with
music
on
tho
,
that
feels
pretty
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
same
anything
but
reading
long
lines
of
text
that
needs
focus
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
watched
lucifer
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
only
remember
the
last
scene
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Where
he
goes
back
into
hell
and
sits
on
a
really
tall
throne
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
what
season
that
ended
off
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
that
’
s
as
far
as
I
can
remember
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
show
was
pretty
good
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
really
tall
throne
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Speaking
of
shows
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Have
you
watched
daredevil
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
I
have
seen
it
on
my
page
,
but
havent
watched
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
know
you
’
re
not
super
into
superheroes
but
it
’
s
basically
about
a
guy
that
’
s
completely
blind
but
he
is
a
vigilante
crime
fighter
at
night
and
a
lawyer
by
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhh
wait
wait
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
heard
of
it
though
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
he
solves
cases
as
a
lawyer
and
then
finds
truths
out
as
a
blind
vigilante
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yes
it
’
s
a
really
good
show
I
’
d
highly
recommend
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
not
on
netflix
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
should
be
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
where
I
watched
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhhh
it
might
’
ve
moved
to
Disney
plus
recently
because
of
the
whole
marvel
thingy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
thats
probably
what
happened
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
that
sucks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
you
ever

👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Also
something
incredible
just
happened
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
???
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
I
just
found
out
that
some
package
is
getting
shipped
to
my
house
and
I
learned
from
an
email
.
I
traced
the
package
order
and
apparently
a
vinyl
that
I
ordered
9
MONTHS
ago
is
finally
arriving
sometime
this
month
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

great
news
,
and
9
MONTHS
ago
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
bought
this
vinyl
long
ago
because
it
was
on
backorder
and
I
really
wanted
it
,
but
it
’
s
so
rare
to
get
one
because
it
stopped
production
on
those
.
And
that
vinyl
costs
about
$
350
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
bought
it
for
$
50
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
completely
unsealed
vinyl
and
it
looked
like
it
was
on
complete
back
order
and
never
shipping
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
forgot
to
refund
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
apparently
they
got
one
and
sending
it
to
me
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
and
they
sent
it
tho
,

.
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
mean
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
earned
this
level
of
confidence
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
rewards
of
the
work
I
do
is
finally
coming
into
fruition
and
its
only
getting
better
and
better
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
lets
pray
that
it
only
keeps
getting
more
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
make
sure
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
vinyls
are
pretty
cool
,
I
never
knew
how
to
play
them
until
you
showed
me
a
while
back
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
mean
I
just
love
the
vinyl
art
cover
designs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
were
so
pretty
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
vinyl
themselves
are
really
cool
,
but
to
also
own
like
a
big
physical
copy
of
your
favorite
album
is
another
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
showed
you
my
exclusive
pink
vinyl
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mac
miller
one
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
that
one
is
super
pretty
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
omg
that
looks
so
calming
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Because
the
vinyl
looks
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
such
a
pretty
lavender
color
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
take
care
of
these
like

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Idk
I
like
collecting
stuff
it
’
s
fun
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
the
entire
concept
of
vinyls
sound
fun
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
expensive
but
worth
it
to
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
can
maintain
financial
stability
so
I
’
m
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
keep
collecting
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Do
you
like
to
collect
anything
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
nothing
in
particular
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wait
,
little
cars
and
hot
wheels
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
don

too
much
about
cars
,
but
they
are
so
cuteee
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhhhhhh
yeahhhhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
gotta
love
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
hot
wheels
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
didnt
even
mean
to
collect
,
but
I
just
kept
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Or
like
mini
replicas
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
replicas
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
’
s
so
sick
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
not
like
obsessed
or
anything
,
but
its
just
there
and
I
dust
them
every
once
in
a
while
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
you
are
probably
about
to
head
out
,
dont
wanna
keep
you
busy
,
you
should
get
going
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
me
how
the
movie
goes
,
I
will
talk
to
you
after
you
are
done
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
For
sure
!
I
’
ll
talk
to
you
later
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👋
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
I
just
finished
watching
Oppenheimer
and
as
you
saw
my
story
,
I
thought
it
was
amazing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Those
were
the
fastest
3
hours
I
swear
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
glad
you
were
able
to
watch
it
without
the
fire
alarm
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
think
you
’
d
like
the
movie
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
There
’
s
a
LOT
of
politics
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
very
very
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Twists
and
turns
everywhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
it
when
there
is
like
the
biggest
plot
twist
in
movies
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
feeling
I
got
from
watching
that
movie
is
like
if
you
were
peering
into
a
history
book
in
visual
form
,
and
you
were
actually
living
in
their
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
WW2
to
Cold
War
era
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
so
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
must
have
felt
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
think
this
movie
is
even
more
enjoyable
especially
if
you
know
the
specific
history
behind
the
atom
bomb
and
Oppenheimer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
was
incredible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Very
historically
accurate
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
amazing
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
will
say
tho
it
is
rated
R
for
a
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
because
its
gory
or
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
not
gore
,
it
’
s
nudity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
2
scenes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
thankfully
not
emphasized
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yea
some
movies
are
really
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
they
could
have
no
added
it
,
but
its
just
a
few
scenes
that
make
it
kinda
weird
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
was
to
portray
a
different
side
of
a
character
which
I
get
it
but
still
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
that
makes
sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
story
is
told
in
a
genius
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
like
1st
person
or
3rd
person
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Without
spoiling
,
it
’
s
told
from
beginning
and
end
at
the
same
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
that
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
see
the
aftermath
of
actions
and
then
you
’
ll
see
what
led
up
to
that
point
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
you
knew
the
ending
when
the
movie
already
had
started
,
it
’
s
just
the
feeling
of
wonder
of
how
it
all
came
to
be
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
which
is
just
fascinating
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
basically
what
led
up
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
could
talk
more
about
it
but
there
is
just
so
much
that
would
spoil
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
mean
idk
when
I
would
actually
watch
it
so
,
its
probably
fine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
why
did
you
give
it
9
.
5
out
of
10
,
why
not
10
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Very
specific
parts
of
the
movie
felt
unnecessary
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
too
many
,
just
a
few
scenes
felt
like
it
didn
’
t
need
explaining
or
they
went
into
it
too
much
without
it
amounting
to
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oooo
lol
,
I
was
like
damn
he
was
so
specific
with
that
last
point
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Everything
else
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Just
amazing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👏
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
the
cinematography
and
motifs
behind
certain
camera
shots
and
color
choices
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
there
’
s
a
section
of
the
movie
that
’
s
just
in
black
and
white
and
having
to
figure
out
why
it
’
s
portrayed
in
such
a
way
it
’
s
incredible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
some
people
put
a
lot
of
effort
in
movies
and
it
shows
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
many
hidden
meanings
behind
character
motives
and
their
ambitions
for
their
actions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
its
like
a
hidden
mystery
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
is
super
cryptic
at
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
when
politics
gets
involved
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
very
political
heavy
like
80
%
of
the
movie
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Because
it
exists
in
the
time
of
Hitler
and
the
communist
party
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
a
big
percentage
,
i
mean
its
based
on
the
atomic
bomb
so
I
assume
it
would
be
involved
in
politics
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
hitler
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OHHHH
dude
I
felt
so
smart
one
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
Oppenheimer
was
writing
a
bunch
of
formulas
on
the
board
and
calculating
the
physics
behind
neutrons
and
how
they
move
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
actually
recognized
a
couple
formulas
from
my
physics
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
was
like
OHHHHH
that
’
s
dope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
the
rotation
formulas
,
the
formula
for
energy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
moment
hits
different
when
you
rememebr
something
you
learned
in
school
si
applied
in
real
life
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
literally
don
'
t
recall
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
like
an
actual
genius
if
you
remembered
a
physics
formula
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
see
why
you
felt
smart
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
blame
my
physics
professor
,
he
practically
burned
them
inside
my
cornea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
shout
out
to
him
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
hell
naw
that
guy
deserves
the
worst
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Jk
jk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
just
don
’
t
like
physics
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
I
know
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
skills
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
dang
,
what
did
he
do
to
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
for
starters
he
gave
us
double
the
tests
compared
to
other
professors
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
our
class
had
an
average
percentage
of
35
%
on
each
test
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
hate
teachers
that
assign
tests
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
For
perspective
,
my
highest
test
scores
was
a
B
-
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
ended
with
an
A
when
he
rounded
our
grades
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
still
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
manages
to
pass
with
A
for
both
semesters
but
it
was
like
a
92
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
He
did
that
at
the
LAST
DAY
of
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
barely
made
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
ended
with
a
90
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Literally
on
the
edge
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
good
for
physics
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
didnt
want
my
GPA
to
drop
than
the
previous
year
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
dont
like
going
home
with
that
face
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
was
like
praying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
must
’
ve
been
scary
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
grade
in
my
physics
class
was
a
C
+
till
the
last
day
when
he
rounded
everyone
’
s
grade
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Most
people
failed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
the
GPA
would
have
stayed
above
4
,
but
still
feels
so
bad
to
know
you
were
just
a
few
points
off
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
get
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
cruel
dude
,
waited
till
the
last
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
hope
that
professors
do
the
same
to
his
kids
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
we
all
begged
to
him
as
a
class
and
he
would
always
make
fake
promises
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
he
always
said
he
’
d
round
tests
but
he
never
did
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Till
the
last
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
mines
was
mean
but
he
was
really
nice
at
the
same
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
used
to
chase
the
football
players
around
and
teach
them
how
physics
worked
by
physically
demonstrating
on
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Wtf
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
told
them
to
hit
him
or
like
throw
a
ball
across
to
someone
in
the
room
to
prove
a
point
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
he
loved
to
talk
about
video
games
and
anime
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
like
during
tests
he
would
let
us
write
whatever
notes
we
could
fit
in
a
index
card
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
write
so
small
on
those
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
you
gotta
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
reminds
me

my
friend
outsmarted
my
professor
on
those
like
cheat
index
cards
by
writing
out
his
notes
on
a
tablet
,
shrinking
it
,
and
then
printing
it
on
the
index
card
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
worked
like
a
charm
and
the
professor
had
no
say
on
it
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
that
is
so
clever
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
brain
doesnt
think
of
those
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
literally
wrote
like
everything
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
definitely
steal
his
idea
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but

i

a
haircut
early
in
the
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
went
well
so
im
happy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
for
the
advice
dude
,
you
speaking
from
experience
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
was
it
like
a
normal
haircut
or
like
one
of
those
fancy
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
i
keep
it
simple
always
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
some
people
go
crazy
with
haircuts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
is
it
just
me
or
does
like
every
person
have
a
specific
barber
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
go
to
my
local
haircut
place
and
they
cut
it
simple
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
that
is
my
dad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
if
im
the
odd
one
out
on
that
or
not
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
he
goes
all
the
way
to
alhambra
to
one
asian
lady
and
gets
it
done
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
you
arent
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
for
me
I
only
go
like
once
in
a
while
to
trimm
my
hair
,
so
it
changes
but
for
my
brother
and
dad
,
its
the
same
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
do
you
like
to
keep
your
hair
long
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
like
not
too
long
just
enough
to
be
able
to
look
good
with
hair
down
and
be
able
to
tie
it
when
needed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
damn
seems
like
i
need
to
find
one
specific
too
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ah
i
gotcha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
i
think
its
because
they
know
how
the
person
wants
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
true
but
they
be
going
like
every
week
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
like
my
dad
gets
the
same
type
of
haircut
like
everytime
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Totally
normal
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]

lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
cleaning
the
house
and
backyard
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
it
must
feel
pretty
good
knowing
they
are
coming
back
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
like
really
messy
or
ok
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
miss
them
,
glad
they
'
re
finally
coming
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
not
super
messy
,
just
had
to
put
stuff
in
order
and
do
a
deep
clean
of
the
house
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
what
'
s
your
plan
for
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
put
music
and
get
scrubbing
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
already
did
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
made
it
go
much
quicker
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Uh
one
of
my
friends
messaged
me
at
12
:
40
this
morning
asking
me
how
to
write
an
argumentative
essay
and
I
dont
know
if
he
read
the
story
yet
or
not
,
so
probably
gonna
help
him
.
Other
than
that
we
shall
see
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
music
always
helps
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
whaaaaaat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
does
he
have
like
summer
class
or
something
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
,
maybe
I
am
not
too
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
is
going
to
PCC
so
maybe
they
start
earlier
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
I
have
a
friend
at
PCC
and
he
hasn
'
t
started
his
semester
yet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
hmm
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
probably
summer
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
probably
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
probably
stayed
up
all
night
trying
to
write
it
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
he
is
not
that
type
trust
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
have
any
plans
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
friends
wanted
to
go
watch
oppenheimer
so
I
might
join
them
,
but
i
just
found
out
that
the
theater
is
like
completely
packed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
I
'
m
trying
to
figure
something
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
forgot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
like
some
other
place
has
spots
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
of
my
friends
went
and
watched
both
yesterday
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
called
it
barbenheimer
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
a
trend
where
you
watch
both
on
the
same
day
back
to
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
you
go
from
super
happy
and
funny
to
peering
into
a
mind
of
complex
emotions
and
internal
battles
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
its
just
jarring
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
its
probably
gonna
feel
weird
transitioning
from
barbie
with
all
that
pink
and
stuff
to
like
wars
and
battles
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
its
not
wars
,
its
just
about
a
guy
that
made
the
best
and
worst
thing
mankind
had
ever
seen
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
your
friends
like
oppenheimer
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
loved
it
,
said
it
was
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
christopher
nolan
'
s
magnum
opus
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
said
it
was
worth
the
3
hours
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
ready
for
it
to
be
6
hours
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
3
hours
go
by
so
fast
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
you
finished
deep
cleaning
and
everything
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
'
m
just
sitting
at
my
desk
and
sorting
stuff
out
on
my
daily
planner
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
I
wanted
to
show
you
something
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
sisters
Starbucks
order
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
yours
was
a
lot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
give
her
the
guiness
world
record
of
longest
starbucks
order
LOL
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
very
specific
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
messing
up
on
one
of
those
,
think
she
would
notice
and
be
like
there
are
only
3
pumps
of
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Quite
and
order
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
they
always
miss
something
on
these
really
long
orders
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
if
I
was
working
and
that
order
came
in
,
I
would
forget
half
of
it
automatically
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
and
it
was
super
busy
over
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
bad
for
the
workers
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
have
to
juggle
so
many
orders
at
once
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
they
always
seems
to
have
a
lot
going
on
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
never
had
a
list
,
I
just
look
at
the
menu
and
order
whatever
feels
right
for
the
day
and
pick
a
size
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
went
with
a
matcha
frappe
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
nothing
else
added
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
so
hot
outside
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
uhhh
...
matcha
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
swear
its
like
an
oven
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
an
industrial
size
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
forgot
you
'
re
not
a
fan
of
matcha
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep
,
its
not
the
worst
thing
,
but
I
would
prefer
other
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
fair
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
you
keep
a
planner
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
pretty
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
try
to
organize
my
ideas
and
tasks
that
I
need
to
get
done
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
I
swear
I
have
like
mini
ADHD
where
I
just
forget
things
I
need
to
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
always
try
to
create
like
a
planner
online
and
the
notebook
onee
,
and
after
like
a
few
days
,
I
give
up
on
it
and
it
remains
somewhere
in
my
room
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
write
everything
down
on
my

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Class

but
usually
people
have
questions
and
need
help
so
it
goes
till
2
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
like
dying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
caught
one
of
my
students
cheating
and
now
I
’
m
just
wondering
what
to
do
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
on
an
exam
type
or
something
else
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nope
on
their
homework
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
does
the
kid
know
that
you
know
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
He
used
an
AI
to
do
it
for
him
and
I
confirmed
it
,
but
the
problem
is
that
he
’
s
actually
really
smart
and
one
of
the
best
students
in
the
class
,
he
’
s
just
lazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
yet
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
well
maybe
ask
him
privately
how
he
is
doing
and
he
is
struggling
anywhere
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
doubt
he
’
s
struggling
with
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Tbh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
He
did
almost
perfectly
today
on
the
kahoot
quiz
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
he
usually
does
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
he
was
just
lazy
,
maybe
if
he
repeats
it
,
you
can
talk
to
him
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
know
he
’
s
capable
because
I
had
him
as
a
student
last
year
and
he
was
one
of
the
best
students
then
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
True
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
never
thought
I
’
d
be
in
this
position
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
then
I
am
sure
that
they
will
be
fine
,
don
'
t
stress
about
it
,
but
if
it
keeps
happening
maybe
confronting
him
about
why
he
is
doing
so
is
probably
the
best
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
just
don
’
t
want
him
to
rely
on
that
for
everything
for
his
own
sake
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
There
comes
a
time
where
even
AI
gets
certain
things
wrong
with
enough
complexity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
stress
too
much
about
it
,
I
am
sure
you
will
figure
out
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
I
understand
,
too
much
AI
is
never
good
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yepppp
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
This
wasn
’
t
a
problem
last
year
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Technology
moves
so
quickly
it
’
s
awesome
but
also
scary
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
its
alright
,
and
you
are
a
very
nice
and
kind
person
,
I
am
sure
if
you
explain
and
tell
them
why
its
bad
,
they
won
'
t
do
it
again
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Technology
is
moving
wayyyyyyyy
to
fast
ngl
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Frrrrrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
appreciate
your

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
Something
big
comes
out
every
week
and
it
’
s
like
woahhhhhhhh
I
was
just
digesting
the
last
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Do
u
think
we
’
d
ever
be
like
under
the
dangers
of
rogue
AI
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
,
quite
often
actually
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
there
needs
to
be
a
limit
to
technology
and
how
we
are
advancing
it
.
I
mean
yes
we
need
to
improve
and
have
advanced
technology
,
but
there
are
things
that
don
'
t
need
technology
and
can
be
left
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
AI
is
messing
with
everyone
and
everything
in
one
way
or
another
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
getting
a
little
too
good
at
certain
things
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
agree
I
think
it
should
be
limited
from
its
actual
crazy
potential
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
kind
of
miss
when
there
was
just
enough
technology
,
like
not
too
much
and
not
too
little
.
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
I
left
my
elementary
school
,
8th
grade
,
there
was
this
little
girl
and
her
name
was
Shirley
and
she
was
cute
and
small
like
probably
in
kinder
or
so
,
and
like
I
was
going
home
from
school
and
she
was
walking
with
like
4
other
girls
,
they
are
like
2nd
graders
,
with
phones
and
making
tiktoks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
🤯
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That

insane
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Why
are
they
on
TikTok
that
is
actually
so
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
not
doing
good
,
especially
for
the
upcoming
generations
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
attention
span
of
the
next
generation
about
to
be
records
low
I
swear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
will
be
in
a
friendship
circle
and
be
texting
instead
of
talking
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
is
WILD
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Technology
is
scary
and
I
am
sure
that
there
is
more
to
come
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

Wall
E

[prabipyakurel]
We

like
people
that
need
technology
to
function
and
gonna
fall
apart
without
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

snoring
the
moment
they
put
their
heads
down
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It

the
brown
parents

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
recessive
genes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
always
,
and
when
we
tell
them
we

hear
them
snoring
from
the
hallway
they
be
like
"
stop

reacting
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Honestly

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Except

[sskarz]

I
consider
myself
lucky
😵
‍
💫
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
actually
enjoyed
chem

,
maybe
because
it
was
over
online
learning
and
all
the
tests
were
open
notes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

religiously
or

but
it

s
fun
to
think

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

sure
the
last
time
I
heard
that
they
misplaced
mines
and
were
like
freaking
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
its
nothing
religious
,
just
like
horoscopes
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Was
yours

cheena

Honestly
my
cheena
was
a
bit
weird
,
it
did
predict
a
lot
of
crazy
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
my
scar
accident
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
it
keeps
turning
true
then
life
is
gonna
be
wild
when
I
graduate
college
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Why
,
is
it
something
bad

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No

s
insanely
good
actually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Which
scares
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
if
its
good
,
then
you
are
fine
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So

not
to
get
my
head
wrapped

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

s
good
to
get
some
quality
driving
practice
in
,
hopefully
you
’
re
feeling
a
little
more
comfortable
around
the
roads
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Basically
just
prepared
for
next
weeks
class
and
a
bunch
of
chores
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
worked
and
then
napped
and
worked
then
went
to
sleep
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
a
little
more
comfortable
,
I
got
scolded
by
dad
for
going
through
the
wrong
side
and
parking
in
a
parking
lot
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
like
on
and
off
huh
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
80
%
on
and
20
%
off
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
told
my
dad
to
take
a
day
off
but
he
insisted
so
we
just
got
to
doing
everything
yesterday
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
RIP
like
you
went
into
the
wrong
side
of
the
road
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
know
when
you
enter
a
parking
lot
there
are
arrows
indicating
which
way
you
go
,
yea
I
went
in
the
right
way
and
was
supposed
to
park
on
the
parallel
side
,
but
i
turned
left
to
the
opposing
side
.
Realized
the
front
of
the
car
went
in
but
back
of
the
car
would
have
hit
the
other
parked
car
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
if
that
makes
sense
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Were
the
parking
spots
kind
of
angled
too
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
those
diagonal
ones
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
it
’
s
supposed
to
help
you
park
if
you
park
in
the
right
direction
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
if
you
’
re
going
straight
and
the
arrow
says
to
go
straight
,
then
the
spots
on
the
right
are
your
spots
usually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Sometimes
they
have
2
arrows
per
lane
and
that
separates
both
sides
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exaclty
,
and
me
being
me
turned
to
the
spot
on
the
left
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
gotcha
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
happens
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

have
seen
my
dad
'
s
face
,
he
called
me
idiot
in
every
nepali
word
he
could
think
of
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

the
steering
wheel
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And

every
language
he

❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

stuff

road
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Even

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm

[prabipyakurel]

Facetime

sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

to
wait
until
I
get

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
i
forgot
to
ask
,
are
you
on
a
quarter
system
or
semester
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Semester
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
much
prefer
semester
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
me
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
quarter
system
just
sounds
like
its
a
summer
semester
in
terms
of
pacing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
that
sounds
like
hell
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
your
midterms
would
be
the
week
after
classes
start
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
cannot
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
brain
slow
,
need
time
to
process
things
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
i
had
to
explain
how
my
mind
works
,
this
is
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
some
people
like
it
because
they
can
pick
another
class
,
but
it
seems
inefficient
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
like
rats
churning
the
gears
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
got
no
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
empty
up
there
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Moves
every
once
in
a
while
on
its
own
when
it
needs
to
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
just
sounds
horrible
idk
i
'
ve
never
liked
the
idea
of
quarter
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
people
explain
and
I
am
like
,
sorry
but
I
cannot
go
through
the
process
of
picking
new
classes
that
fast
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
just
reminded
me
of
that
sloth
from
zootopia
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Berkeley
and
merced
are
the
only
UCs
on
semester
system
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
realized
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yikes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
true
because
i
have
a
friend
at
UC
Irvine
and
he
absolutely
hates
quarter
system
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
loveeeee
this
guy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ikr
he
was
so
funny
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Sounds
too
fast
and
busy
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Sloths
are
amazing
,
they
show
how
my
life
is
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Super
slow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
lazy
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
dream
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
wanted
my
summer
to
be
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
instead
it
was
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
accurate
because
the
fire
represents
how
damn
hot
it
is
every
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
like

[sskarz]
and
it
costs
too
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
fr
,

its
better
to
just
make
something
at
home
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
did
make
some
food
but

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
m

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

what
my

She
thinks

to
eat
rice
and
stuff
over
there
and
stick
to
fast
food

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

easy
to
get
sick
of
food
not
just
from
fast
food
,
but
everything
i
swear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
yea
once
you
have
something
,
you
need
to
at
least
give
it
a
week
before
having
it
again
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah

building
but
its
for
like
100
+
people
to
use
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
clean
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
We
got
a
microwave
and
mini
fridge
to
share
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
got
a
big
water
bottle
that
will
hopefully
fit
in
there
and
keep
my
water
cold
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oooo
like
a
hydro
flask
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
the
half
gallon
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Keep
getting
scolded
for
not
drinking
enough
water
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
those
are
so
good
to
keep
your
water
cold
,
the
ice
stays
for
so
long
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hydro
check
,
drink
water
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
gonna
drink
some
as
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
'
t
even
get
through
a
normal
hydroflask
size
water
bottle
though
the
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
you
gotta
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
important
to
keep
yourself
hydrated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
a
thing
i
do
that
helps
with
me
stay
hydrated
is
like
keeping
my
water
bottle
in
my
line
of
sight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
it
just
makes
me
more
obligated
to
drink
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
really
gotta
start
doing
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
forget
,
like
it
goes
through
my
mind
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
happens
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
it
is
pretty
important
for
health
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
now
that
i
think
about
it
,
have
you
heard
anything
about
your
dorm
mate
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
no
actually
,
have
no
idea
who
I
will
be
with
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
friend
is
trying
because
she
doesnt
like
her
housing
location
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
they
can
only
take
so
many
requests
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
aw
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
was
she
already
denied
or
just
straight
ignored
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
ignored
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
rip
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
there
'
s
probably
hundreds
of
people
also
requesting
change
so
it
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
but
now
we
just
have
to
see
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So

chilling
,
not
sleepy
yet
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
sleepy
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
laying
down
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Think
about
life
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
a
mood
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
eveyr
night
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
ik
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
When
you
like
can
’
t
fall
asleep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
and
then
i
open
up
youtube
and
it
just
goes
away
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
gets
exhausting
thinking
about
that
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
trust
things
will
be
ok
if
i
'
m
in
my
right
mind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
that
’
s
the
way
to
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
ever
feel
like
you
don
’
t
know
what
you
are
doing
even
when
things
are
going
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
all
the
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
U
were
typing
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
sorry
i
didn
'
t
know
if
you
wanted
to
type
first
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
you
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
think
about
it
literally
everytime
something
goes
right
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
just
come
to
accept
the
fact
that
there
'
s
not
a
point
in
thinking
about
what
could
go
wrong
if
you
can
go
in
it
with
full
confidence
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
you
'
ll
more
than
likely
succeed
more
often
with
full
confidence
than
none
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
that
’
s
pretty
good
actually
,
yea
I
need
to
start
building
more
confidence
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
some
weird
thing
to
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
that
'
s
how
i
see
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
still
fear
the
unknown
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

a
lot
less
nowadays

.
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Sometimes

about
it
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
50
%
of
a
class
'
difficulty
is
on
the
professor
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
its
a
good
professor
,
that
50
%
is
off
and
its
just
way
easier
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
just
scared
for
my
philosophy
class
,
I
hope
the
dude
is
not
too
heavy
on
the
philosophical
aspects
of
the
work
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

make
sure
your
professors
are
the

to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
read
their
reviews
for
the
classes
you
'
re
taking
and
make
a
judgement
based
off
how
they
teach
and
their
curriculum
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
yea
for
sure
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
hopefully
they
are
all
somewhat
nice
and
easy
going
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
just
want
a
professor
that
'
s
fair
yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
there
are
some
out
there
that
are
just
teaching
for
just
the
money
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
type
come
on
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nooooooooooooooooooooo
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
do
this
way
too
much
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
uh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wayyy
to
much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
now
im
tryign
to
remember
what
i
was
going
to
type
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
right
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
they
are
just
going
to
teach
what
'
s
minimum
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
terrible
professors
i
mean
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
there
are
professors
like
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
a
lot
more
than
you
'
d
think
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
a
lot
of
the
times
they
do
teaching
on
the
side
and
they
have
another
primary
job
that
they
have
to
take
more
attention
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
you
'
re
like
an
after
thought
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
a
cs
professor
that
worked
with
nasa
actively
but
taught
us
on
the
side
as
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
now
he
wasn
'
t
terrible
,
but
there
are
those
that
will
still
not
put
any
effort
into
the
teaching
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
get
your
point
,
imma
make
sure
to
read
up
on
them
carefully
and
make
sure
that
I
get
the
teaching
for
the
amount
of
money
imma
pay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

like
looking
for
my
dad

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And

’
t

glasses
anymore
right
,
I
completely

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍

you
'
re
a
fan
of
them
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You

point

[prabipyakurel]
Haven
’
t
really
ever
put
them
on
,
got
actual
glasses
that
I
need
to
see
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
sure
you
can
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
sometimes
when
my
vision
gets
blurry
,
i
try
adjusting
my
"
glasses
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
end
up
looking
like
an
idiot
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
lol
I
get
what
you
mean
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
do
that
when
I
take
them
off
for
bad
and
go
downstairs
without
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
ever
sleep
with
your
glasses
on
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
unless
I
fall
asleep
somewhere
downstairs
or
at
other
peoples
houses
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
take
them
off
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
have
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
i
literally
drop
dead
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
can
'
t
even
react
to
put
them
away
before
i
go
to
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
that
has
happened
like
once
,
I
just
get
scared
I
will
end
up
sleeping
on
it
and
break
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Because
like
I
need
them
to
see
,
eyesight
is
not
the
best
without
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
what
'
s
your
prescription
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Negative
.
75
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yours

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Haha

at
like
-
2
or
-
3
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
forgot
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
this
is
the
only
prescription
I
remember
but
things
blurr
out
easily
so
I
assume
it
went
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
When
did
you
get
glasses
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ever
since
i
had
memories
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
consciousness
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
swear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
not
lying
about
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
1st
grade
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
literally
cannot
remember
a
time
in
my
life
that
i
hadn
'
t
had
glasses
on
my
face
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
before
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
young
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Most
likely
genetics
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
refuse
to
believe
you
messed
your
eye
that
bad
when
you
were
that
young
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
its
been
like
that
for
since
i
was
conceived
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
since
the
big
bang
it
was
prophesized
on
the
walls
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
"
thy
sanskar
will
have
terrible
eyesight
all
his
life
,
till
he
was
19
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
what
i
'
d
like
to
believe
,
but
i
was
already
super
around
computers
and
screens
all
the
time
as
an
infant
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
maybe
my
eyesight
just
got
terribe
as
a
wee
lad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
like
an
IT
genius
at
2
.
😎
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
i
was
a
spongebob
genius
at
2
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
I
forgot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
only
got
glasses
in
8th
grade
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
wow
that
was
quite
recent
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
kinda
needed
since
7th
,
just
never
told
my
parents
I
had
problems
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Till
it
got
too
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
smh
gotta
know
the
lore
of
this
incredibly
stupid
character
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ah
i
gotcha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
not
too
far
back
,
but
I
feel
like
I
got
so
used
to
it
,
I
can
’
t
really
go
anywhere
or
have
been
anywhere
without
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Unless
it
’
s
for
pictures
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
don
'
t
like
wearing
your
glasses
in
pictures
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
do
,
but
like
when
I
wear
Nepali
clothes
,
I
like
the
change
of
a
picture
without
my
glasses
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Looks
different
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
i
seeee
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
the
opposite
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
used
to
hate
taking
pictures
without
my
glasses
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
honestly
i
still
kinda
do
,
sunglasses
got
me
covered
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
am
sure
you
look
fine
without
your
glasses
,
maybe
because
you
had
it
on
for
so
long
,
it
doesn
’
t
feel
right
without
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
but
idk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
feels
so
weird
and
wrong
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
19
years
of
looking
a
certain
way
till
not
is
jarring
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
understand
if
I
am
in
jeans
and
t
shirt
,
I
need
my
glasses
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
would
you
ever
do
lasik
surgery
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
when
I
am
a
little
older
,
like
after
bachelors
perhaps
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
wanna
do
anything
to
my
eye
just
yet
,
when
I
have
the
time
,
I
think
I
will
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
ok
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
is
a
really
weird
experience
im
ngl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
your
entire
vision
goes
white
when
they
cut
it
open
and
you
feel
like
you
just
entered
heaven
'
s
gates
and
i
swear
i
thought
i
died
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
We
’
re
you
writing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
writing
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
text
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
it
went
away
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
you
mean
if
i
was
typing
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
i
didn
'
t
mean
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
can
speak
your
mind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
sorry
i
try
to
stop
typing
and
then
i
start
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
go
ahead
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
no
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
thought
I
was
being
mean
for
a
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
got
to
stop
doing
that
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
was
just
going
to
ask
if
you
felt
anything
during
the
surgery
,
like
did
it
hurt
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
they
gave
me
anxiety
pills
to
take
and
then
they
numbed
my
eye
with
some
drops
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
when
they
started
going
on
my
eye
,
i
felt
nothing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not
even
pressure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
it
really
felt
like
i
was
about
to
ascend
to
heaven
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
until
i
saw
the
scalpel
going
across
my
vision
and
then
everything
started
going
wonky
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
idk
how
to
explain
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
like
they
took
my
vision
and
started
moving
like
it
was
aggressively
drunk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
sounds
pretty
funny
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
just
in
circles
in
circles
in
circles
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
ngl
that
'
s
when
i
learned
i
was
not
afraid
of
death
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
felt
at
peace
when
going
through
that
10
minute
process
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
literally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
can
'
t
hear
anything
,
can
'
t
see
anything
,
barely
can
feel
the
bed
you
'
re
sleeping
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
if
you
died
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
surreal
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
once
the
operation
was
done
,
its
like
if
you
literally
went
blind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ooooo
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
im
talking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
last
prescription
before
declared
blindness
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
everything
is
blurry
,
even
if
they
'
re
right
next
to
your
face
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
a
foggy
dashboard
of
your
car
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
your
windshield
is
in
fog
and
it
just
won
'
t
wipe
away
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
you
can
'
t
see
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
wild
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
once
i
slept
like
16
hours
and
i
woke
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
must
have
felt
a
little
scary
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
crystal
clear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
,
I
thought
that
those
that
did
eye
surgery
would
be
able
to
see
clearly
right
away
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
actually
quite
the
contrary
,
you
have
to
literally
close
your
eyes
all
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
can
'
t
see
screens
or
they
litearlly
burn
your
retina
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
you
have
to
go
straight
home
,
and
go
to
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
slept
at
like
2
pm
,
woke
up
multiple
times
throughout
the
night
but
i
kept
my
eyes
shut
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
painful
for
that
one
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not
as
in
literal
pain
,
but
like
not
being
able
to
do
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
,
that
’
s
wild
tho
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
don
’
t
feel
pain
or
anything
now
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
only
if
i
stare
at
a
screen
for
like
10
hours
straight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
that
'
s
like
normal
for
most
people
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
only
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
is
that
your
astigmatism
goes
through
the
roof
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
at
least
for
my
procedure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
didn
'
t
do
actual
LASIK
,
i
did
something
called
SMILE
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
which
is
a
form
of
LASIK
but
it
comes
with
different
properties
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
such
as
heightened
astigmatism
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
bright
small
lights
have
that
huge
glow
around
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
drive
at
night
you
might
know
what
im
talking
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
more
than
what
they
show
on
the
picture
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
I
see
this
every
once
in
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
really
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
maybe
you
have
light
astigmatism
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
only
happens
sometimes
but
yea
sometimes
it
looks
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
seeing
that
was
normal
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
is
normal
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
astigmatism
is
normal
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
most
people
have
it
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
its
not
a
big
deal
in
terms
of
our
eyesight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
how
it
impacts
how
far
you
can
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
are
you
near
sighted
or
far
sighted
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Near
sighted
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
okay
that
'
s
great
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
its
a
lot
easier
to
do
LASIK
with
near
sightedness
than
far
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
my
dad
is
far
sighted
,
he
can
’
t
read
off
a
paper
in
front
of
him
but
you
put
it
at
a
distance
and
he
will
read
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
used
to
be
near
sighted
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
far
sighted
have
the
big
issues
with
trying
to
improve
their
eyesight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
no
optomoterist
tho
so
idk
the
specific
details
as
to
why
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
idk
eyes
are
weird
to
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
'
re
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
complicated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
you
sleep
well
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
was
kinda
uncomfortable
because
of
the
weather
but
I
randomly
passed
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
passed
out
like
2
mins
after
my
last
text
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
such
a
weird
vivid
nightmare
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
that
was
me
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
vivid
nightmare
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
super
weird
and
confusing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
thought
it
was
so
real
until
i
woke
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
i
realized
i
was
being
delusional
in
my
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
what
did
you
see
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
basically
i
was
talking
to
someone
i
really
did
not
like
in
my
past
and
i
was
confused
as
to
why
i
was
talking
with
them
in
the
first
place
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
i
got
like
death
threats
and
it
was
just
what
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
geez
,
thats
odd
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
hated
that
person
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
did
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
still
do
,
but
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
'
ve
even
thought
about
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
was
really
confused
when
i
saw
them
in
my
dream
for
no
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
swear
it
was
like
lucid
dreaming
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
can
'
t
really
explain
why
i
hated
that
person
just
because
there
'
s
a
lot
of
history
in
it
,
but
i
really
don
'
t
like
when
people
emotionally
manipulate
and
have
the
freedom
to
do
that
when
they
threaten
to
kill
themselves
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
yea
forget
about
those
people
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
even
think
about
them
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
haven
'
t
till
last
night
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
were
part
of
my
early
high
school
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
been
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Were
your
friends
before
or
,
just
classmates
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
when
i
first
met
them
we
were
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
you
know
no
one
really
shows
themselves
for
who
they
are
based
off
first
meet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
catch
onto
things
as
time
goes
on
and
i
learned
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
sorry
that
you
had
to
see
them
again
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Was
it
a
group
of
people
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
one
person
for
the
most
part
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
the
group
they
were
part
of
were
also
problematic
for
diferent
reasons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
okay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
just
shocked
for
the
most
part
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
forgot
they
existed
for
a
while
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Keep
forgetting
,
get
them
out
of
your
brain
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
fr
people
that
have
hurt
you
mentally
or
physically
are
not
worth
anything
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
tried
to
help
them
but
when
it
started
affecting
my
other
friends
too
is
when
i
draw
the
line
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
no
yea
,
stay
away
from
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
crazy
part
is
that
they
actually
attend
my
college
,
thankfully
i
haven
'
t
ran
into
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
pray
that
you
dont
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
most
of
the
people
that
i
dislike
are
on
my
campus
and
i
'
ve
only
seen
one
a
couple
of
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
got
no
one
from
my
high
school
that
i
actually
like
with
me
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
,
its
alright
,
you
are
friendly
and
I
am
sure
you
are
great
at
connecting
with
new
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah

'
t
worry
about
me
,
i
'
ve
found
way
cooler
people
that
i
like
to
be
around
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
the
most
part
,
if
I
went
to
cal
state
LA
i
would
run
into
half
my
elementary
middle
and
high
school
friends
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lot
of
them
roaming
around
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
i
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
m

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
yep

way
better
memories

remember
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

Hey
hey
good
afternoon
!
Sorry
if
I
’
ve
been
off
,
crazy
thing
popping
up
left
and
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
How
was
your
day
yesterday
?
I
didn
’
t
get
to
ask
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Good
afternoon
,
no
worries
,
no
need
to
apologize
lol
.
Um
yesterday
was
not
too
busy
,
we
just
had
a
normal
day
.
I
took
all
my
clothes
out
from
my
closet
and
made
a
mess
,
then
decided
yesterday
wasnt
the
day
to
start
organizing
,
so
i
shoved
everything
back
in
there
aggressively
.
Then
we
had
a
small
puja
at
night
,
which
was
pretty
much
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
you
must
’
ve
felt
pretty
overloaded
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
A
little
but
I
will
just
fix
it
another
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
is
your
project
coming
along
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
going
good
,
haven
’
t
got
to
work
on
it
today
yet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
We
just
had
a
large
influx
of
family
over
since
yesterday
and
I
had
literally
no
idea
this
was
happening
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
all
of
yesterday
and
most
of
today
has
just
been
hanging
with
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
social
meter
is
beyond
depleted
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
well
that
must
have
felt
nice
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
have
like
baby
cousins
that
you
saw
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
I
had
known
they
were
staying
over
maybe
,
but
I
had
no
clue
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Nah
I
met
a
cousin
my
age
and
his
little
sister
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
so
it
was
like
a
little
sleepover
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
yea
little
kids
are
fun
to
have
around
to
a
certain
extent
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
far
from
little
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
I
learned
today
that
they
are
also
leaving
later
today
so
it
was
a
big
relief
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
as
much
as
I
like
my
extended
family
,
I
can
only
deal
with
so
much
without
mentally
preparing
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
,
well
thats
nice
,
was
your
room
used
or
something
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

a
little
kid
,
I
got
to
go
say
hi
and
hold
them
in
my
arms
until
they
start
crying
,
then
I
put
them
down
and
leave
them
alone
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

my
entire
family

it
but
me
idk
why
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
like
playing
with
them
but
I
don
’
t
really
go
too
crazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmm
maybe
you
just
haven
'
t
met
a
cute
little
kid
yet
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I

a
baby
with
babies
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
will
no
longer
think
I
am
an
18
year
old
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

a
little
kid
and
pick
them
up
or

peak
-
a
-
boo
with
them
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
do
but
not
for
long
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
might
be
because
I
was
also
an
annoying
kid
so
maybe
somewhere
something
happened
I
’
m
just
not
too
crazy
about
kids
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
are
not
annoying
,
but
you
are
funny
,
but
i
understand
where
you
are
coming
from
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
After
the
age
of
5
,
its
pretty
predictable
that
a
kid
will
be
somewhat
annoying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha
you
are
far
from
annoying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It

s
a
canon
event
for
every
kid

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Duuuuuuuude

that
routine
but
it

s
often
interrupted
by
random
events

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OMG

Like

re

anything
at
all
today
,
they
’
ll
say
no
,
then
sometime
later
that
day
we
have
a
plan
to
do
something
all
of
a
sudden
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
when
I
am
bored
af
i
don
'
t
mind
,
but
when
I

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes

plans
on
the
spot
,
within
5
min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ikr
and
it
’
s
like
that
one
day
where
you
need
to
do
something
specific
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
so
relatable
and
sometimes
its
a
plan
that
you
never
expected
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
don
'
t
even
know
why
you
are
going
there
and
to
do
what
exactly
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Me
every
time
I
’
m
going
to
a
Nepali
event
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
swear
they
’
ll
be
like
,
oh
it
’
s
a
barthamun
,
but
I
’
d
have
to
figure
it
out
who
was
the
one
that
had
to
go
bald
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
,
one
of
those
where
you
have
to
figure
out
the
main
character
of
the
event
situation
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
be
just
following
for
the
food
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
always
at
the
same
venues
every
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nepali
people
when
they
find
one
good
venue
,
everyone
is
gonna
use
it
for
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
I
ask
my
parents
which
venue
it
is
and
if
it
’
s
a
one
with
terrible
food
,
I
try
my
best
to
convince
them
that
I
don
’
t
want
to
go
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
yessssss
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
it
’
s
not
good
food
and
the
event
is
something
I
don
’
t
care
about
then
it
’
s
just
recipe
for
disaster
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
gonna
be
bored
for
hours
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
When
you
have
to
go
to
a
nepali
even
do
you
ever
think
about
the
possibility
of
you
meeting
someone
you
can
talk
to
and
if
you
can
'
t
think
of
any
,
you
dont
go
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
if
that
is
only
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
yes
that
’
s
the
third
requirement
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
gotta
know
someone
there
that
I
can
talk
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
if
you
’
re
at
an
event
,
I
’
ll
go
cuz
at
least
we
can
talk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
there
’
s
no
one
I
know
I
DEFINITELY
don
’
t
wanna
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ahhhh
lol
the
3rd
requirement
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
wanna
be
that
guy
in
the
corner
sleeping
or
on
the
phone
all
the
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
love
it
when
I
can
talk
to
someone
and
not
just
sitting
there
looking
at
groups
of
uncles
and
aunties
having
conversations
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
sitting
in
the
corner
and
staring
at
other
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Frrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
thankfully
after
the
pandemic
there
’
s
not
that
many
functions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ik
kinda
glad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
remember
it
used
to
be
like
every
weekend
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
was
so
tired
of
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
like
it
was
a
party
for
some
of
the
most
simple
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
also
because
when
we
were
younger
,
there
werent
as
much
nepali
people
and
now
you
will
meet
a
new
one
at
every
function
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeahhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
recently
there
’
s

a
large
influx
of
Nepali
people
living
in
California
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
new
people
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

lot
of
new
people
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
used
to
be
able
to
recognize
everyone
at
a
party
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Now
everyone
I
recognize
at
a
function
is
at
like
2
tables
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
In
a
room
of
20
tables
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
right
,
I
used
to
be
like
oh
this
persons
reletive
or
its
this
person
,
and
now
I
have
to
ask
and
be
like
who
dis
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
crazy
out
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
we
’
re
not
really
watching
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
We
’
re
like
stalking
some
people
on
instagram
on
some
tea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
fun
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
I
have
no
idea
what
’
s
going
on
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
just
looked
for
a
second
and
they
’
re
stalking
some
Nepali
twins
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
insta
is
fun
for
stalking
people
,
not
that
I
do
that
,
it
is
still
new
to
me
so
I
discover
something
new
every
once
in
a
while
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhhhh
I
forget
you
’
re
new
to
the
social
media
space
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
do
insta
stalking
but
my
sister
loves
to
so
I
just
listen
to
her
stories
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
i
honestly
wouldnt
have
gotten
it
if
my
friends
didnt
keep
telling
me
I
would
mane
any
friends
or
connections
with
out
insta
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
definitely
harder
to
connect
without
these
apps
but
it
’
s
not
all
that
necessary
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
sometimes
its
fun
to
type
the
name
of
celebs
and
people
from
you
school
you
knew
nothing
about
and
see
what
they
are
like
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
True
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
sometimes
just
type
the
weirdest
names
to
see
if
someone
with
that
name
exists
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Same
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
search
up
some
people
who
I
haven
’
t
seen
or
heard
from
in
years
and
it
’
s
always
a
shock
to
see
how
they
are
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol

[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
for
the
motivation
,
when
I
saw
the
email
today
,
I
was
like
actually
pretty
bummed
out
because
I
thought
that
the
worst
was
moving
away
from
family
,
and
the
feeling
of
being
with
new
people
alone
is
another
thing
to
add
to
the
list
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Orrr
playing
as
your
angels
advocate
,
you
can
hang
out
with
some
people
that
and
enjoy
their
company
to
have
the
best
time
you
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
ig
I
can
give
that
a
try
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
it
won
'
t
be
as
bad
as
I
am
making
it
and
I
won
'
t
end
up
lonely
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
doubt
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
see
how
someone
can
dislike
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

How
long
do
you
usually
stay
at
the
gym
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Uh
it
depends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
I
’
m
not
feeling
it
as
much
then
I
go
for
at
least
30
minutes
but
I
go
as
hard
as
I
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
I
’
m
pumped
then
I
stay
for
around
an
hour
and
a
half
to
2
hours
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
still
go
as
hard
as
I
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
you
ever
wanna
see
progress
,
gotta
give
it
your
all
in
anything
you
want
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
tonight
I

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats

good
advice
,
I

use
that
if
and
when
I
start
going
to
the
gym
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Come

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Imma

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
"

pepper
spray
?"
[sskarz]
"
nah
i

this
tho
"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
will
probably
be
a
bad
idea
giving
me
any
thing
of
that
sort
tbh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
OMG
like
a
few
months
also
there
was
a
spider
near
my
room
and
I
told
my
dad
to
remove
it
and
throw
it
OUTSIDE
and
he
took
it
and
just
dropped
it
down
the
stairs
and
said
,
"
there
its
gone
",
that
thing
is
probably
big
now
and
laying
eggs
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
how
cool
would
it
be
to
own
a
flamethrower
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Honestly
,
I
wouldn
'
t
mind
having
one
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
late
for
school
and
walking
at
the
pace
of
a
turtle
down
the
stairs
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
yeets
it
down
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
like
that
,
or
other
days
he
is
gonna
be
like
"
oh
wow
,
its
gonna
eat
you
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
your
dad
is
a
menace
oh
my
god
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
mean
maybe
that
spider
died
on
impact
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
a
pretty
far
fall
no
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
but
we
have
like
flowers
on
this
stand
and
it
probably
fell
on
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
those
dont
die
fast
,
they
take
a
long
time
to
die
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
why
the
hell
do
they
not
die
faster
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
maybe
u
should
start
research
on
the
death
of
all
spiders
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
altho
i
think
if
all
spiders
died
,
our
entire
ecosystem
would
be
in
shambles
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
I
will
run
across
and
picture
of
one
and
traumatize
myself
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

home
injured
from
my
house

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Everything

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Pretty

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Are

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
tired
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
okie
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
I
see
,
maybe
you
should
just
lay
down
and
think
about
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
too
tired
to
think
about
nothing
at
this
point
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
that
’
s
a
problem
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
think
for
the
first
time
in
a
really
long
time
,
i
feel
like
im
powerless
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
’
s
alright
,
sometimes
when
too
many
things
are
thrown
at
you
at
once
,
life
gets
kinda
boring
and
exhausting
,
but
after
a
good
night
sleep
you
should
be
good
to
go
tomorrow
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
what
i
thought
too
,
but
I
'
ve
started
to
feel
like
this
for
a
little
bit
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
just
thinking
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
worried
about
anything
specific
or
thinking
too
much
about
something
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
'
t
explain
everything
,
but
I
feel
like
I
'
m
being
pulled
to
do
so
many
things
that
I
can
'
t
focus
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
spreading
thin
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
these
past
couple
of
days
really
made
me
feel
like
no
matter
how
much
I
try
to
focus
to
do
the
things
I
want
to
do
,
something
interrupts
and
its
like
I
can
'
t
get
a
grip
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
sorry
for
venting
to
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
no
no
,
I
am
always
here
if
you
want
to
talk
,
it
’
s
okay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
rewarding
yourself
often
with
like
little
treats
or
taking
breaks
often
is
what
you
need
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
writing
how
you
feel
on
a
paper
or
sharing
is
always
a
good
way
to
release
all
that
you
are
feeling
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
can
tell
you
will
be
just
fine
,
take
time
for
yourself
,
don
’
t
take
in
too
much
and
try
to
space
things
out
as
much
as
possible
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Idk
if
this
helped
,
but
yea
like
I
said
you
can
always
just
share
how
you
are
feeling
when
you
are
feeling
stressed
and
overwhelmed
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
it
did
help
,
thank
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
will
try
to
take
more
breaks
whenever
I
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
put
so
many
things
on
my
own
plate
to
make
myself
busy
for
the
summer
,
that
I
just
put
too
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
now
I
'
m
heavily
regretting
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
completely
understand
,
I
did
so
many
unnecessary
studying
and
preparing
which
I
really
didn
’
t
need
and
now
that
it
’
s
over
I
think
to
myself
what
have
I
done
for
myself
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
really
contemplating
on
quitting
on
one
of
them
,
but
its
difficult
when
friends
are
involved
that
I
don
'
t
want
to
let
down
.
But
at
the
same
time
I
don
'
t
know
how
much
longer
I
can
keep
doing
it
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
sometimes
its
just
so
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
sometimes
its
okay
to
let
your
friends
know
that
you
can
only
devote
a
certian
amount
of
time
into
something
.
I
am
sure
they
will
understand
where
you
are
coming
from
,
you
have
a
lot
of
leadership
positions
and
teach
also
,
that
is
a
lot
.
Its
okay
,
let
your
friends
know
and
it
wont
be
like
you
are
letting
them
down
.
Just
do
as
much
as
you
are
able
to
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
probably
the
best
thing
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
you
deserve
rest
and
you
need
it
to
,
no
shame
in
asking
for
some
space
and
time
every
once
in
a
while
.

All
I
know
is
I
'
m
not
making
this
mistake
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
At
the
cost
of
being
able
to
be
productive
every
minute
of
every
day
,
my
mental
health
just
tanked
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
everything
in
life
teaches
us
something
,
so
maybe
drop
some
things
that
are
just
there
to
make
your
brain
hurt
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Don
'
t
do
what
I
do
lol
,
time
for
yourself
also
matters
and
I
just
completely
lost
track
of
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
too
many
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
still
trying
to
improve
on
giving
myself
time
,
at
this
point
whenever
good
things
happen
multiple
times
in
a
row
,
I
can
'
t
be
happy
with
a
straight
face
because
I
feel
like
something
is
going
to
come
crashing
down
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Many
people
have
told
me
to
make
time
for
myself
because
I
don
'
t
do
that
.
I
really
got
to
stop
talking
in
too
much
than
I
can
handle
,
so
you
are
not
alone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
couldn
'

relate
more

I

that
feeling
every

[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
really
got
to
stop
doing
that
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
deserve
time
for
ourselves
and

the
things
that
we
want
to
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]

looking

my
high
school
years
,
dude
I
gave
up
so
much
time
to

so
I
could
get
into

school
of
my
dreams
,
and
it
has
caused
me
so
many
problems
.
[prabipyakurel]

big
mess
in
my

️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
'
s
not
that
too
much
of

high
school
but
classes
are
in
separate
places
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
u
just
have
a
new
environment
,
but
that
just
means
another
time
to
adapt
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
every
other
time
you
'
ve
had
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm

to
think
about
,

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
maybe
I
am
a
little
dramatic
but
it

my
entire
life
is
going
to
be
something
else
.

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you

t

single
round
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Beauty
sleep
came
in
clutch
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
mind
is
not
built
for
puzzles
that
require
me
to
think
for
longer
than
30
seconds
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Neither
is
mine
i
dont
even
know
why
I
put
myself
through
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
probably
because
of
the
boredom
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
fr
be
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

was
trying
them
out
,
it
looked
fine
,
so
we
shall
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Did
you
get
a
new
prescription
too
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
new
ones
are
more
clear
which
means
that
my
prescription
probably
got
worse
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
yeah
it
’
s
always
like
that
Aladdin
scene
with
new
glasses
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
everything
becomes
ultra
HD
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
like
I
take
off
my
glasses
and
like
everything
is
so
weird
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
sometimes
I
be
looking
real
ugly
without
glasses
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nah
you
would
look
fine
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
hated
how
I
looked
without
glasses
till
I
actually
got
eye
surgery
,
and
I
don
’
t
hate
it
as
much
anymore
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
you
look
fine
without
glasses
,
not
too
much
of
a
difference
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
its
because
you
get
used
to
being
around
everyone
with
them
on
that
when
they
are
not
on
it
feels
weird
and
uncomfortable
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
if
thats
only
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
100
%
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
super
weird
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
definitely
something
to
get
used
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
still
think
that
I
have
glasses
on
from
time
to
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
you
do
that
glasses
fix
thing
with
the
fingers
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
YEAHH
LOL
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
sometimes
when
I
’
m
driving
at
night
and
since
my
astigmatism
is
super
high
,
I
try
to
like
“
adjust
”
my
glasses
that
aren
’
t
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

someone
sitting
next
to
you
,
they
gonna
be
like
"
what
was
dat
?"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
A
lot
of
people
have
noticed
me
doing
this
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
just
feels
natural
to
do
it
even
tho
I
just
don
’
t
wear
glasses
anymore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
I
mean
,
you
have
had
them
for
a
while
before
the
surgery
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
make
fun
of
you
all
the
time
if
i
ever
caught
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
purposely
fix
my
glasses
in
front
of
you
and
laugh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
How

now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

I
am
sure
my
eyesight
got
even
worse
,
I
am
getting
used
to
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
are
so
much
more
clear
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
did
they
give
you
a
cleaning
kit
too
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
a
kit
,
they
give
a
box
and
that
tissue
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
run
it
over
the
sink
,
that
is
my
cleaning
kit
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OMG
I
used
to
do
that
all
the
time
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
one
’
s
got
time
for
kits
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Fr
I
lost
my
box
and
microfiber
cloth
like
2
weeks
in
without
fail
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
the
box
just
sits
there
,
there
is
no
use
when
you
need
the
glasses
24
/
7
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
totally
agree
,
the
cloth
is
stuck
in
some
corner
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
exactly
,
and
the
only
real
time
you
put
them
down
is
to
sleep
or
shower
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
the
only
times
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Okay
question
,
have
you
tried
using
contacts
before
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
they
seemed
too
annoying
and
too
much
work
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
agree
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
My
brother
had
and
he
got
tired
of
them
and
he
got
rid
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohh

’
s
why

’
s

on
glasses
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
were
like
late
for
school
and
dude
was
talking
like
a
full
30
min
putting
one
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
tried
once
and
I
almost
had
a
heart
attack
because
I
failed
to
put
it
on
and
I
thought
it
went
under
my
eye
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
that
’
s
when
I
was
like
nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahahahaha
I
feel
like
that
would
be
a
fear
to
have
though
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Imaging
getting
those
things
stuck
in
your
eye
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
be
dying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
100
%
I
saw
this
crazy
story
of
a
grandma
that
wore
contacts
her
whole
life
,
and
she
had
like
12
contacts
under
her
eye
that
stayed
there
for
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
she
was
storing
it
to
take
with
her
😇
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
hell
naw
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
how
do
you
not
notice
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
now
that
I
read
that
statement
it
seemed
kinda
mean
🙊
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
thought
she
was
about
to
die
with
them
in
LMAOO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
when
words
just
come
out
your
mouth
and
you
it
hits
you
a
few
moments
later
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Me
when
I
try
to
give
advice
to
my
friend
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
just
comes
out
wrong
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Every
time
without
fail
I
swear
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

I
go
give
a
dumb
advice
,

me
,
I
am
begging
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Fr

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

ve
done
it
so
many
times
that
my
friends
have
just
made
it
a
meme
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
my
brain
doesn
’
t
even
get
to
process
what
I
say
in
the
moment
till
after
and
then
it
’
s
instant
regret
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
god
that
is
so
relatable
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
I
have
been
mean
so
many
times
now
that
I
think
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
as
long
as
it
wasn
’
t
intentionally
it
’
s
funny
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
it
was
never
intentionally
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
when
my
friend
’
s
boyfriend
cheated
on
her
,
I
told
her
to
run
him
over
so
…
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Honestly
valid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
She
took
a
better
approach
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
was
so
mean
,
you
don
’
t
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
was

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
What
did
she
do
,
now
I
’
m
curious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
they
had
a
few
problems
,
and
I
knew
the
dude
,
he
was
an
okay
person
.
They
were
going
on
and
off
and
they
had
took
a
break
for
a
while
but
like
got
together
again
a
few
weeks
for
prom
because
they
got
tickets
together
.
She
was
happy
and
they
were
matching
and
I
was
giving
all
of
my
wishes
to
them
.
But
like
after
prom
,
she
went
onto
his
insta
and
he
had
pictures
with
this
other
girl
and
they
were
hugging
and
kissing
and
stuff
.
She
FOUND
OUT
,
and
he
was
with
the
other
girl
and
still
decided
to
go
to
prom
with
her
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
broke
her
for
a
while
,
but
now
she
is
going
better
and
we
call
convinced
her
he
was
an
ass
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
wtf
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
He
always
seemed
sus
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
is
next
levels
of
fucked
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
excuse
my
language
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
damn
that
dude
deserves
nothing
good
in
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
are
fine
,
yea
I
hope
he
goes
through
the
same
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
she
messaged
me
at
2
:
00
but
I
only
saw
it
in
the
morning
and
she
was
not
okay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
damn
,
I
hope
she
'
s
doing
better
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
she
deserves
someone
way

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg
my
kids
from
last
year
also
joined
this
year
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
they
told
me
that
they
wish
they
could
come
to
class
in
person
because
they
thought
it
was
way
more
fun
doing
it
in
the
class
with
how
I
taught
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
was
like
mannnnnn
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
don
'
t
come
in
-
person
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
it
’
s
awesome
to
see
my
kids
from
last
year
be
the
best
students
in
this
year
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Most
are
virtual
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Only
3
people
come
to
class
in
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
36
other
students
join
virtually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohh
wow
,
I
thought
you
were
surrounded
by
like
50
kids
when
teaching
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
you
are
in
the
front
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
nah
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
how
I
visualized
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wish
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Line
Up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
more
fun
to
teach
when
they
’
re
with
me
irl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
did
is
your
perspective
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Last
year
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
this
year
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Sadly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Altho
last
year
I
only
had
12
students
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Now

ve

to
40
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🤯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
is
still
a
lot
of
kids
to
handle
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
is
the
age
range
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
of
the
kids
you
teach
?

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They

re
8

16
year

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Most

the
10
-
12
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
OOOO

nice
,
that
is
quite
a
group
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
great
job
,
if
I
was
teaching
that
kid
range
I
would
have
been
on
the
news
for
abusing
a
kid
already
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
I
was
so
lost
after
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
all
the
adults
decided
to
take
a
rug
outside
and
sit
so
basically
the
kids
inside
had
my
entire
house
as
a
playground
with
me
watching
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

i
would
literally
just
be
on
my
phone
and
pretend
the
world
around
me
is
just
a
figment
of
my
imagination
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

gonna
take
over
the
next
day
[prabipyakurel]

give
me
the
death
state
if
he
comes
home
and
still

it
there

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hopefully
I

pick

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

that
I
check
to
switch
to
that
also
fufills
the
requirement
has
like
all
the
discussion
classes
waitlisted
already
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
checked
in
with
senior
and
juniors
there
and
they
said
that
I
should
be
fine
,
maybe
extra
reading
or
essays
,
but
other
than
that
I
think
its
okay
.

[sskarz]
did
your

counselor
get
back
to
you
regarding
that
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
,
she
said
to
filter
it
out
and
keep
looking
but
I
have
those
classes
set
with
no
time
conflicts
and
I
am
not
gonna
put
myself
through
that
again
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
checked
professor
rating
and
made
a
list
of
how
they
all
are
and
what
to
expect
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
i
was
supposed
to
take
a

because

2
star
reviews
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

BS
my

something
so
i
can
avoid
those
guys
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

I
doubt
the

will
go
deeply
into
100
students
essays
,
open
notes
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

it
in
a
way
.
I
feel
like
I
am
ready
now
,
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
still
scary
.
I
don
'
t
really
have
a
word
to
describe
how
I
am
feeling
and
feel
as
if
I
am
always
repeating
myself
when
you
ask
how
I
feel
about
leaving
but
its
like
that
unknown
feeling
(
good
nor
bad
).
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
I
know
I
keep
asking

had
changed

I
didn

️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
IKR
I

so
surprised
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
just
stared
at
me
but
I
got
it
to
stare
at
the
camera
eventually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
can
i
see
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
why
the
dog
'
s
eyes
look
like
they
'
re
about
to
pop
out
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
they
have
been
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
this
one
is
the
jumpy
one
,
There
was
another
one
but
it
went
upstairs
because
it
doesnt
like
loud
noises
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
just
like
me
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
now
that
i
think
about
it
,
that
'
s
my
dog
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
gets
scared
of
plastic
bubble
wrap
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
like
scared
scared
or
like
just
meh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
backs
up
a
considerable
distance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Those
things
are
so
fun
to
play
with
though
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
he
'
ll
go
to
a
wall
and
peek
out
in
case
its
gonna
blow
up
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
dog
can
'
t
take
anything
relative
to
a
popping
sound
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
hates
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwww
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
if
he
comes
near
me
and
I
start
popping
the
bubble
wrap
,
he
will
go
away
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
probably
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hold
on
brb
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
aaaaaaaaand
im
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

list
of
chores
done
and
finally
sitting
down
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
whatcha
doing
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
what
would
you
say
is
your
most
favorite
and
least
favorite
chore
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
curious
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Most
favorite
goes
to
vacuuming
:
simple
,
easy
,
and
I
can
wear
my
headphones
and
I
can
’
t
even
hear
the
vacuum
[sskarz]
Least
favorite
:
cleaning
the
entire
backyard
[sskarz]
I
think
that
speaks
for
itself
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
favorite
would
probably
be
wiping
down
the
kitchen
counters
,
oooo
when
you
get
a
stain
off
that
been
there
for
a
while
,
it
is
so
satisfying
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
The
worst
,
is
like
yours
,
backyard
,
I
sweep
halfway
and
the
wind
is
like
"
hello
there
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Blows
all
the
leaves
around
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
I
forgot
to
mention
,
backyard
gets
even
worse
when
my
dog
is
roaming
around
and
he
be
getting
too
close
for
me
to
sweep
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
FRRRRR
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
he
is
just
there
walking
around
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
my
dog
keeps
running
on
the
dead
leaves
so
they
all
crack
and
break
apart
,
making
more
of
a
mess
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhh
i
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
painful
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
u
guys
got
the
fake
grass
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Turf

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m

with
ya
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
I
was
like
"
oh
my
god
,
i
forgot
that
word
existed
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
He
gets
his
ball
and
he
throws
it
near
my
feet
for
me
to
play
with
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
the
thing
is
,
if
I
throw
it
once
,
he
just
wants
to
play
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
then
follows
me
everywhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
but
that
is
just
love
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
he
makes
it
so
hard
to
clean
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
give
him
food
inside
when
you
are
cleaning
outside
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
He
will
most
certainly
make
it
a
disaster
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
He
a
messy
eater
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he

throwing
food
everywhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
a
messy
boi
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oof
,
well
then
play
fetch
with
him
so
much
until
he
is
too
tired
to
move
and
then
get
to
cleaning
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
universe
will
end
before
he
'
s
tired
of
playing
fetch
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
being
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
boi
does
not
get
tired
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
dudes
got
that
energy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
can
either
be
the
laziest
boi
to
ever
exist
,
or
be
the
most
energized
doggo
around
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
that
power
also

to
me

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
was
weird
,
because
we
dropped
off
our
stuff
into
the
room
and
went
out
to
eat
so
they
can
leave
early
.
And
we
ate
momo
and
the
nepali
lady
was
pretty
nice
,
got
her
number
in
case
I
ever
needed
anything
.
But
like
the
moment
they
were
walking
me
back
to
my
dorm
,
like
midway
walking
I
looked
back
at
my
dad
and
started
bawling
.
Then
as
I
walked
I
was
crying
and
people
were
also
staring
at
me
too
.
It
has
been
that
tye
of
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
are
you
feeling
any
better
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
whenever
I
call
them
I
freeze
,
you
know
that
feeling
where
you
will
start
crying
when
you
talk
and
you
can
feel
a
cry
starting
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
yes
thank
you
,
I
am
doing
a
lot
better
than
a
few
hours

.

and
its
been
a
lifesaver
🙏
[sskarz]

where
its
like
caffeine
,
whey
protein
powder
,
mango
,
and
some
other
fruits
like
banana
,
all
blended
together
and
it
tastes
amazing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
only
like
400
calories
and
it
fills
me
up
for
a
very
long
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
on
long
school
days
,
its
saved
me

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

angsty
if
they
stay
past
like
7
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

I
think
Indian
parents
have
a
problem
when
friends
come
over
for
longer
than
a
few
hours
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
be
like
”

live
with
us
now
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
frrrrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
one
time
my
friends
have
stayed
longer
than
7
pm
was
when
my
parents
went
to
go
travel
and
we
built
my
PC
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
your

😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um

a
Nepali

house
and

I
think

,
but

than
that
it
was
a
strict
no
.

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
never
had
a

lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Stupid

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
parents
have
a
strict
policy
of
like
friends
can
come
over
for
a
short
time
,
but
no
sleepovers
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

was
with
me
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

sleep
overs
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

also
allow
me
to
stay
at
a
friends
house
for
pretty
long
,
just
no
sleeping
over
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i

afterwards
and
it
was
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
when
in

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

cite
tiktoks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

[prabipyakurel]
Hahaha
I
cannot

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Think
about

and
find
songs
relating

that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
but
like
,
most
of

are
very
laid
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
really
upbeat

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Dis
what

looks
like
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

its
literally
just
everyone
outside
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

more
of
an
indoor
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
it
’
s
like
open
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

boring
over
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
’
m

I

has
their
own
way
of
doing
stuff
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

a
bad
feeling
about

[prabipyakurel]
Like
I

impact

you
are
probably
changing
the
lives
of
your
students
as
you
teach
them
.
You
are
doing
amazing
and
other
people
your
age
are
probably
out

partying

sniffing

that
hike

have
left
me

That
is
how
slow
I

going
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
would
not
leave

d

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
hike
cardio
go
crazyyy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
I
felt
like
I
was
so
out
of
shape
,
I
should
probably
start
going
to
the
gym
and
all
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
YESSSSS

the
gym
club
[sskarz]

s

[sskarz]

the
physical
and
mental
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
as
soon
as
my
life
is
normalish
here
,
I
will
probably
start
looking
for
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Your
uni
probably
has
one
included
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Wait
no
it
most
definitely
has
one
and
it
’
s
like
fancy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg
so
I
have
a
story
that
just
happened
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Me
wants
to
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
rn
I
’
m
at
Pasadena
charging
my
dads
car
,
and
I
was
like
,
I
’
m
kind
of
hungry
so
I
’
m
gonna
go
to
this
local
sandwich
shop
to
eat
something
then
leave
right
.
As
I
’
m
walking
down
the
street
,
I
notice
someone
behind
me
walking
with
clanging
keys
to
his
side
so
I
could
tell
how
far
or
close
he
was
.
Like
10
minutes
go
by
as
I
walk
and
he
’
s
slowly
walking
faster
towards
me
and
I
’
m
matching
his
speed
to
walk
away
from
him
as
he
’
s
trailing
.
Then
I
hear
the
keys
clanging
a
lot
more
and
I
hear
fast
footsteps
behind
me
,
so
I
literally
stepped
to
my
right
closer
to
the
street
and
I
see
him
with
his
shoulder
front
,
going
right
where
I
was
walking
like
his
plan
was
to
tackle
me
.
He
screams
“
ESE
,
DO
YOU
FUCKING
SPEAK
ENGLISH
MOTHERFUCKER
”
and
I
glance
at
him
before
I
start
running
the
other
way
,
and
getting
the
dial
for
911
ready
.
And
then
after
about
20
seconds
of
running
as
hard
as
I
could
,
I
look
behind
me
and
he
was
long
gone
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
I
hadn
’
t
dodged
to
the
side
,
he
was
planning
to
tackle
me
to
the
ground
like
a
psycho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
walked
back
to
my
car
and
now
I
’
m
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Wild
wild
experience
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
was
on
some
shit
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
first
of
all
,
that
’
s
scary
and
crazy
,
hope
you
are
okay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
probably
was
on
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Jeez
,
yea
im
glad
you
ran
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
had
no
idea
if
he
had
some
kind
of
weapon
so
I
just
ran
for
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
must
have
scared
you
,
yea
be
careful
next
time
,
maybe
don
’
t
go
out
at
night
like
that
alone
too
much
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
reach
the
local
shop
too
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
he
did
who
knows
,
yea
no
that
scared
me
all
the
way
over
here
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha

’
s
okay
,
I
’
m
okay
and

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay

to
hear
,
did
you
get
the
food
though
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

I
ran
back
to
my
car
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
just
drive
there
instead
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
don
’
t
drive
there
,
lol
drive
somewhere
else
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hmmm
probably
a
better
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
back
home
and
eat
whatever
is
in
the
pantry
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mmm
I
would
but
my
dad
said
he
would
pay
for
dinner
sooooooo
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Was
he
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nope
,
he
sent
me
to
go
charge
his
car
at
a
charging
network
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
me
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
,
yea
be
careful
out
there
,
crazy
people
walking
around
rn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
home
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
I
’
m
still
charging
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
just
sitting
in
the
car
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
need
to
have
the
car
ready
for
tomorrow
in
case
the
hurricane
does
something
and
we
need
a
transportation
vehicle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
I
see
,
but
yea
stay
in
the
car
,
and
this
happened
like
a
short
while
ago
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Literally
5
mins
ago
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
responding
to
one
of
your
messages
while
that
all
happened
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wild
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
yea
if
you
didn
’
t
notice
,
he
would
have
probably
done
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Gotta
stay
aware
of
all
of
your
surroundings
all
senses
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
All
the
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
,
this
is
why
I
am
scared
to
wander
out
alone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
you
ever
have
to
,
bring
pepper
spray
or
some
defense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
have
any
self
defense
than
calling
911
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
should
probably
get
myself
pepper
spray
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yes
you
definitely
should
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
for
sure
,
lol
I
always
afraid
someone
will
ask
me
something
and
like
take
me
away
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Sometimes
911
takes
too
long
and
you
need
to
defend
yourself
in
that
moment
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Me
too
,
but
sometimes
I
think
about
how
I
can
take
them
on
and
my
odds
of
winning
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
please
do
not
ever
try
that
,
run
to
someone
,
don
’
t
take
them
on
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
I
won
’
t
but
yk
,
as
a
guy
I
think
about
these
things
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Better
to
get
help
or
defend
yourself
and
run
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
matter
how
strong
you
are
(
and
how
many
times
you
go
to
the
gym
),
run
,
and
keep
running
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
gym
gains
about
to
come
in
clutch
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
well
glad
to
hear
you
are
safe
,
but
how
was
your
day
at
the
gym
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
my
god

,
I
felt
so
horrible
afterwards
,
10
/
10
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
got
home
and
literally
passed
out
for
an
hour
😵
‍
💫
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
did
you
eat
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
a
2
hour
session
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
2
hours
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
had
some
kebab
and
bhat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
felt
powerful
after
that
and
then
got
home
and
slept
like
a
baby
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

sounds
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

my
buddy
brought
his
girlfriend
so
we
all
trained
together
,
took
longer
than
usual
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh

know
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
There
’
s
this
restaurant
called
California
Kebab
Kitchen
that
my
family
loves
,
and
my
parents
brought
me
a
platter
so
I
gladly
had
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
,
we
had
rice
and
chicken
but
I
thought
it
was
all
beef
,
so
I
just
ate
plain
rice
and
2
cookies
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
rip
,
did
you
find
out
it
was
chicken
afterwards
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
found
out
after
I
was
done
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Awwww
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
strictly
avoid
beef
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
in
the
evening
my
aunt
had
brought
fried
rice
and
watermelon
,
so
I
just
had
some

rn

California

ran
out

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF

to
catch
that
ball
and
get
their
team

[sskarz]
if
a
person
runs
the
entire
field
,
they
score
a
point
for
the
team
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

more
on
the
lines
of
interstellar
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
inception
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or

film
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
saving
private
ryan
maybe
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

).
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
by

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

a
scholarship
of
35
,
000
and
tuition

,

[prabipyakurel]

?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

6k
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
not
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
that
everything
included
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
that
’
s
just
tuition
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
since
I
’
m
doing
my
integrated
masters
program
,
there
’
s
no
added
tuition
with
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
get
both
degrees
with
a
year
extra
and
no
extra
cost
than
if
I
just
did
5
years
for
a
bachelors
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
To
be
honest
,
I
just
want
to
live
my
life
after
college
debt
free
and
*
mostly
*
done
with
formal
education
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Which
is
exactly
why
I
went
with
the
program
that
I
did
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
that
sounds
like
a
great
plan
honestly
,
yea
you
got
this
.
Yea
I
can
’
t
wait
to
be
done
with
bachelors
and
go
to
law
school
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
How
many
years
at
law
school
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
3
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Dangggg
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
’
re
in
it
for
the
long
run
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
7
years
of
straight
education
(
assuming
you
don
’
t
take
a
break
year
)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
no
breaks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
take
a
break
after
I
graduate
the
last
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
respect
that
,
but
do
keep
in
mind
that
if
it
ever
gets
to
an
extreme
level
of
stress
and
bad
things
,
always
an
option
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
after
law
school
it
’
s
the
Bar
exam
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
gotta
pass
that
,
then
get
sworn
in
to
the
state
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
’
s
as
far
as
my
knowledge
of
becoming
a
lawyer
goes
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
are
correct
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
There
was
a
time
in
my
life
where
I
seriously
considered
becoming
a
lawyer
,
and
that
was
solely
due
to
the
fact
that
I
really
liked
debate
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Then
I
learned
about
all
that
and
I
’
m
ngl
,
I
don
’
t
have
the
patience
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aww
,
I
mean
you
can
be
an
IT
guy
and
a
lawyer
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
way
I
would
lose
all
my
cases
for
my
clients
and
get
kicked
out
of
a
law
firm
all
within
the
first
week
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
if
you
ever
consider
it
,
we
will
be
in
it
together
,
would
be
fun
😊
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
losing
cases
won
’
t
kick
you
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Sorry
,
I
don
’
t
have
the
mental
capacity
for
that
😵
‍
💫
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
I
’
ll
be
cheering
you
on
as
you
go
on
your
journey

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
it
’
s
alright
,
honestly
speaking
sometimes
I
take
on
so
much
more
that
I
can
handle
and
end
up
forgetting
about
my
mental
state
in
the
process
.
Yea
and
it
scares
me
when
I
think
about
my
future
sometimes
.
Like
I
feel
like
I
will
mess
up
somewhere
and
end
up
doing
something
wrong
.
Sorry
lol
that
was
a
long
response
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks

Hey
no
you
’
re
fine
,
I
like
when
you
can
lay
out
your
thoughts
.
And
don
’
t
worry
,
I
think
about
that
all
the
time
too
.
It
’
s
scary
and
feels
like
life
is
going
to
screw
you
up
somewhere
,
or
maybe
even
you
’
ll
screw
it
up
somehow
.
But
as
long
as
you
remember
that
you
’
re
in
control
of
your
own
future
and
whatever
goals
your
chasing
,
you
will
always
think
first
before
every
move
you
make
,
and
it
’
ll
be
easier
to
avoid
the
mistakes
along
the
way
.
Trust
me
,
you
’
ll
make
mistakes
and
you
’
ll
think
it
’
s
the
end
of
the
world
.
Been
there
,
done
that
,
over
it
.
It
’
s
never
over
,
and
the
mental
battle
to
think
like
that
is
the
hardest
.
In
time
,
you
’
ll
see
your
progress
as
a
college
student
and
you
’
ll
see
where
you
could
’
ve
done
better
.
Absolutely
you
will
.
But
it
’
s
important
to
keep
going
,
having
learned
from
your
mistakes
and
always
improving

one
of
the
best
things
I

this
summer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
just
the
summer
,
meeting
you
and
getting
to
know
you
more
has
been
one
of
my
highlights
of
2023
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
actually
we
probably
would
not
have
started
taking
like
this
if
you
had
net
,
but
I
am
really
glad
you
did
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Me
as
a
person
?
As
one
of
your
highlights

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
in
all
seriousness
,
thanks
for
brightening
my
days
,
it
really
warms
my
heart
when
I
get
to
talk
to
you
and
not
feel
pressured
to
be
something
that
I
don
’
t
need
to
be

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

autocorrect

,
I
will
make
sure
to
post
this
post
,
that
you
came
up
with
it
first
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
it
would
turn
the
adjective
into
an
active
present
verb
..?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
I
’
m
speaking

[prabipyakurel]

Watch

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
“
Professor

more
amazinger
because

their
actions
”
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well

my
nicknames
that

:
[sskarz]
Sanskar
(

[sskarz]
Sans
[sskarz]
Scarface
[sskarz]
Sand
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

create
a
new
one
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
how
Scarface
came
to
be
but
some
people
legitimately
refer
to
me
as
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Give

few
days
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Idk

meant
to
be
in
a
mean
way
or
a
funny
way
but
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Funny
because
they
relate
it
to
the
scar
on
my
face
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
they
also
can
’
t
say
sanskar
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hahahaha
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It

😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
People

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
How

people
mess
up
your
name
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
not
,
it
’
s
literally
a
Nepali
word
that
means
good
moral
and
ethics
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
live
up
to
the
name
proudly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Preeeebi
,
privi

praybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Where

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
People

drunk
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
what
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LOL
WHAT
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Nah
these
people
cannot
be
real
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

and
enunciated
the
“

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
As
you

!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ugh

to
Sanskar
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
will
,
and
I
’
ve
got
a
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
starbucks
on
campus
has
some
employees
that
know
me
because
I
’
ve
been
there
with
friends
many
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
idk
why
,
but
every
time
I
order
there
,
even
with
my
friends
,
I
’
ll
get
a
heart
drawn
on
my
cup
,
but
my
friends
wouldn
’
t
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Still
trying
to
get
that
figured
out
🤔
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
the
barista
a
girl
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
rotate
baristas
like
everyday
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
everyday
it
’
s
new
,
but
I
swear
I
get
it
every
time
without
fail
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
No
clue
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
huh
,
maybe
they
have
like
a
favorite
customer
wall
with
your
name
on
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
know
my
drinks
be
bussin
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
it
comes
to
Starbucks
,
I
’
ve
got
lists
of
drinks
for
certain
moods
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Either
that
or
you
the
special
one
with
the
longest
list
of
ingredients
in
a
drink
so
they
draw
a
heart
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Similar
to
my
Spotify
playlists
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Hey
hey
mine
is
certainly
not
that
bad
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
if
it
’
s
a
long
list
item
,
I
’
ll
order
it
online
so
I
don
’
t
have
to
stand
there
like
an
imbecile
and
telling
them
line
by
line
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Jk
Jk
,
lol
you
are
probably
really
nice
to
them
,
it
’
s
probably
why
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Imagine
,
that
person
behind
you
will
give
you
the
bombastic
side
eye
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😒
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ve
gotten
MANY
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
that
’
s
just
because
my
friends
and
I
be
goofing
around
like
total
idiots
sometimes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
lol
,
it
’
s
alright
,
just
be
you
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
There

someone
there
to
criticize
you
,
like
always
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
just
drown
it
all
out
and
take
constructive
criticism
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
confidence
has
been
on
the
up
and
up
ever
since
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Life
hack
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
’
s
so
cool
that
they
do
that
for
yours
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

’
m

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

self

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Weird
college
things

and
hearing
the
howl
of
the
storm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Low
key
soothing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

face

I

the
most
comfortable
position
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Is
that
how
you
sleep
regularly
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
grinding
never
stops
,
am
I
right
?
🤭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
more
of
a
baby
fetal
position
sleeper
myself
🧐
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
**
in
agony
**
mhmmm
yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
sleep
in
that
baby
fetal
position
too
,
that
is
the
way
I
sleep
,
but
when
you
need
a
nap
and
are
tired
,
the
face
down
feels
so
good
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
the
face
down
with
the
nap
combo
is
unbeaten
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
like
you
restart
your
brain
type
nap
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
it
’
s
okay
to
skip
a
day
,
remember
to
give
your
body
a
break
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
need
my
body
to
break
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well
I
told
them
if
it
rains
too
hard
then
I
’
m
not
going
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
the
way
I
sleep
,
I
will
wake
up
on
the
wrong
side
,
with
no
pillows
and
like
blanket
on
the
floor
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Saaaaaame
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
will
probably
rain
hard
tomorrow
,
leave
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
be
upside
down
like
my
feet
will
be
where
my
head
was
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
move
a
lot
during
my
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
me
everyday
,
that
’
s
why
my
parents
think
I
will
fall
off
my
bed
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
that
would
be
the
funniest
thing
ever
ngl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
a
lot
,
I
be
having
one
of
those
heat
beating
fast
moments
because
of
the
shortest
nightmare
and
wake
up
then
drop
back
down
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
wake
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
happens
quite
often
with
me
as
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
have
nightmares
back
to
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
all
short
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
I
thought
that
was
only
a
me
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
told
u
when
I
woke
up
from
a
blackmailing
nightmare
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
like
it
happens
fast
and
then
I
wake
up
all
scared
and
when
I
fall
asleep
it
’
s
another
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
that
was
connected
from
other
nightmares
and
also
just
waking
up
in
between
each
one
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yup
exactly
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
never
have
good
dreams
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
happens
so
much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Best
I
got
is
skipping
to
the
next
morning
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Those
sleeps
are
good
tho
,
when
you
got
nothing
to
remember
about
the
night
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Some
of
the
best
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well

rainbows
and
unicorns

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ik
aren
’
t
I
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
too
,
maybe
a
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
the
dreams
that
make
me
happy
is
when
I
’
m
like
just
floating
around
and
I
’
m
aware
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
take
it
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
floating
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Odd
I
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
the
feeling
of
being
nowhere
and
it
’
s
just
peaceful
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
,
it
just
makes
me
very
relaxed
and
happy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it
sounds
peaceful
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
nothing
is
bugging
me
and
I
could
just
stay
like
that
forever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well
till
I
wake
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl
yea
when
I
dream
about
just
scenery
it
is
calming
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
rarely
happens
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
unfortunately
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
hope
when
I
die
,
I
can
live
out
the
afterlife
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aye
aye
,
no
we
don
’
t
talk
about
death
,
we
got
years
to
live
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
who
knows
what
that
is
like
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
yeah
I
know
,
just
talking
philosophically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
mean
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
To
be
honest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
d
be
happy
knowing
that
after
life
there
is
nothing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
probably
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
you
’
re
just
in
a
state
of
nothingness
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Okay
you
know
what
bugs
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
if
you
really
think
about
it
,
you
only
exist
because
of
how
life
is
,
no
clue
before
or
what
’
s
after
it
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
when
we
eventually
die
,
is
it
just
back
to
nothingness
?
And
then
what
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Weird
to
think
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
not
really
spiritual
or
anything
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
This
is
how
I
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
weird
to
think
about
,
but
like
yea
it
is
a
questionable
matter
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
could
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Shame
I
’
d
have
to
die
to
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Last
thing
on
the
bucket
list
,
before
I
kick
the
bucket
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
me
get
hit
by
a
bus
tomorrow
,
dw
I
will
let
you
know
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ugh
okay
,
that
’
s
one
way
to
put
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
god
prabi
don
’
t
say
that
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Clever
wasn
’
t
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
💯
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
ik
death
scares
me
,
but
like
imagine
,
life
is
so
fragile
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
really
is
…
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Okay
,
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ve
been
thinking
about
this
for
a
while
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
promise
that
you
won
’
t
tell
anyone
what
I
’
m
about
to
tell
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
my
word
,
I
promise
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
recently
,
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
,
my
dad
went
to
get
a
colonoscopy
.
And
long
story
short
,
the
doctor
said
that
a
tumor
was
about
to
grow
inside
his
body
,
and
he
’
s
lucky
to
be
alive
.
His
previous
doctor
had
actually
found
it
before
it
started
growing
and
removed
it
,
and
he
said
to
him
that
he
’
d
be
dead
in
a
year
,
which
meant
that
he
would
’
ve
died
by
now
if
it
wasn
’
t
removed
a
year
ago
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
got
me
in
a
really
…
really
depressed
state
for
a
couple
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
made
me
realize
how
much
my
life
would
’
ve
crumbled
to
pieces
knowing
in
a
different
reality
,
I
would
’
ve
lost
my
dad
this
year
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
think
partly
due
to
that
,
I
’
ve
been
pushing
myself
to
my
limits
and
doing
everything
I
can
to
better
myself
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
that
’
s
scary
to
think
about
,
and
I
am
happy
that
he
is
here
with
everyone
.
But
hey
he
is
safe
now
dw
,
and
I
pray
that
he
will
continue
to
have
the
best
health
.
Don
’
t
ever
think
about
that
too
much
,
you
are
okay
,
you
keep
doing
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
it
got
me
thinking
about
how
I
should
spend
my
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
We
only
have
so
much
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
life
can
change
in
an
instant
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
that
scared
me
,
and
don
’
t
worry
I
won
’
t
tell
anyone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
so
I
am
going
to
share
something
similar
,
and
can
you
not
tell
anyone
either
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
sorry
for
scaring
you
,
I
didn
’
t
mean
to
.
And
thank
you
,
for
keeping
it
to
yourself
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
worries
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
promise
I
won
’
t
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
have
my
word
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
so
,
your
dad
got
it
like
a
couple
weeks
ago
but
my
dad
has
his
colonoscopy
tomorrow
.
And
today
he
has
just
been
drinking
liquids
and
stuff
to
get
ready
and
I
was
literally
talking
to
them
before
texting
you
,
but
yea
I
am
hoping
that
his
test
goes
smoothly
tomorrow
and
we
get
good
results
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Your
dad
will
be
just
fine
.
I
’
ll
manifest
that
for
you

t

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And

,

have
my
word
I
won
’
t
tell
a
soul
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ty

neither
,
this
will
be
between
us
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
For
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
yeah
,
don
’
t
you
worry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
just
a
normal
checkup
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
am
taking
it
as
a
normal
checkup
and
when
I
was
still
in
LA
,
I
would
be
calling
the
doctor
and
asking
them
if
it
was
serious
and
stuff
,
but
yea
I
am
praying
that
things
go
smoothly
for
him
tomorrow
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
will
,
just
trust
that
it

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Sorry

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You

very
charming
you

that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
I
was
laughing
when
I
wrote
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
sky
is
probably
telling
me
to
close
my
window
before
I
get
my
room
flooded
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Seriously
,
it
sounds
like
a
tornado
out
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
sleeping
with
the
window
open
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
uh
close
that
thing
shut
and
lock
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
problem
do
be
that
my
room
heats
up
real
quick
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
the
only
way
I
get
cold
air
rn
is
from
the
window
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
I
forgot
to
mention
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
won
’
t
,
it
’
s
raining
out
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Earlier
when
we
were
talking
,
my
power
went
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
’
m
not
sure
when
that
’
s
coming
back
so
no
AC
for
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhhh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
you
got
no
light
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nope
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
the
light
from
my
phone
and
the
moon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
We
’
ll
just
look
at
the
moon
for
light
as
of
now
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
apparently
,
this
is
the
weather
after
most
of
the
hurricane
had
already
dissipated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
can
’
t
wrap
my
head
around
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
heard
it
should
go
away
like
throughout
the
night
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Might
last
through
Monday
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
probably
will
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
But
they

in
their
beds
doing
their

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
the
problem
with
afternoon
naps
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
hard
to
sleep
later
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
try
to
avoid
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
The
naps
,
not
roommates
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
about
to
say
like
DAMN
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
sometimes
what
I
say
surprises
me
first
and
then
I
realize
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Listen
to
the
sound
of
this
wind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
swear
it
’
s
not
visually
impactful
,
and
even
the
sound
isn
’
t
accurate
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
howling
winds
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
it
’
s
like
stormy
stormy
out
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
WHY
IS
THE
WINDOW
STILL
OPEN
???
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
NEED
THE
COLD
AIR
OTHERWISE
I
WILL
DIE
OF
HEAT
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
and
my
power
came
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Perfect

that
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mmmmmmmn

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
wanna
get
out
of
bed
to
go
turn
on
the
AC
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
if
you
have
to
leave
like
an
inch
or
2
open
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
the
entire
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Eh
I

ll
compromise
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You

you
,
but
stay
safe
,
lol

wild
out
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Do

?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanted
to
go
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
would
get
hit
by
many
tiny
ice
rocks
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
then
I
would
bring
the
water
in
so
I
was
denied
to
do
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Meh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Fair
enough
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

I

ve
only
seen
hail
in
LA
like
3
times
in
my
entire
lifetime
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
thought
that

s
as
wild
as
weather
could
get

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

most
recent
one

crazy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

from

other
2

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

I
was
exhausted
,

I
almost
cancelled

my
friend
but
it
’
s
those
times
that
are
critical
to
stay
disciplined
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
pushed
so
much
weight
today
,
I
beat
a
lot
of
my
personal
records
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
your
muscles
are
probably
screaming
again
lol
.
But
yea
like
if
you
dont
feel
up
to
it
,
its
alright
to
tell
your
friends
no
,
I
am
sure
they
understand
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
today
concludes
my
3
day
split
,
so
tomorrow
is
a
certified
rest
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
go
for
myself
,
no
pressure
from
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Remember
my
motto
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
best
remember
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
key
to
becoming
successful
in
anything
is
consistency
and
discipline
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
With
those
2
things
,
over
time
any
challenge
can
be
overcome
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
any
goal
can
be
reached
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
for
sure
,
I
will
keep
that
in
mind
,
yea
I
an
trying
to
make
a
schedule
that
includes
a
time
for
me

a

I
am
trying
my
best
to
read
and
take
notes
.
I
think
I
will
do
half
today
and
half
tomorrow
because
I
have
time
,
so
I
dont
burn
myself
out
in
the
process
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Take
it
a
step
at
a
time
,
I
agree
you
shouldn
’
t
push
yourself
when
you
’
re
having
headaches
,
it
’
ll
just
make
it
worse
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
,
my
dad
'
s
report
cameout
normal

think
last

i

helped
alot
of
people
pick
out
laptops
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
,
you
are
probably
an
expert
,
my
dad
be
walking
around
costco
looking
at
computers
and
stuff
and
the
person
there
explaining
is
like
blah
blah
blah
and
I
am
there
just
standing
all
confused
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
ok
ok
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
advice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
don
'
t
ever
ever
listen
to
a
sales
person
talk
about
the
computers
or
laptops
they
sell
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
just
say
a
bunch
of
BS
that
sounds
good
,
but
you
will
probably
pay
more
for
a
machine
than
for
what
its
worth
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
ever
need
a
recommendation
on
any
tech
,
let
me
know
and
i
can
find
a
proper
deal
on
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
in
terms
of
price
to
performance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
my
go
to
guy
for
tech
,
o
will
not
be
reaching
out
to
anyone
else
,
trust
me
.

a
laptop
to
a
friend
a
couple
weeks
ago
for
his
budget
range
,
and
he
'
s
been
incredibly
happy
with
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
makes
me
feel
good
when
my
friends
/
family
can
avoid
all
the
bs
that
costco
employees
will
tell
you
about
tech
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

previous
calc
knowledge
[prabipyakurel]

I

done
the
coding
version
of
stats
in
data
science
but
seems
pretty
interesting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
or
precalc
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
calc

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
calculus

one
of
the
easiest
math
courses
of

time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

lie
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
precalculus
was
harder
,
algebra
2
was
harder
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
calc
1
is
a
joke
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Is
it
because
you
are
good
at
math
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
algebra
,
it
’
s
amazing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
if
you
saw
my
math
,
i
would
get
the
answer
Africa
in
a
math
test
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
calculus
is
like
,
you
get
to
skip
all
the
algebra
and
get
the
answer
by
converting
numbers
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

precalc
,
calc
1
,
calc
2
,
and
calc
3
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
calc
1
is
by
far
the
easiest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
calc
3
is
the
hardest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn

messaging
you
if
I
got
problems
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
be
able
to
help
you
in
the
beginning
,
but
my
memory
may
be
foggy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
derivatives
are
pretty
easy
to
figure
out
anyways
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s

lol

of
high
school
too
and
people
used
to
tell
me
all
the
times
,
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if

you
saw
me
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
would
throw
up
if
you
saw
my
backpack

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[sskarz]

early

a
major
security
risk
tied

my
email
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

I

would
have
binged
watched
those
videos
you
made
in
high
school
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
had
to
move
everything
from
that
email
to
a
new
secure
email
,
and
delete
the
old
one
in
the
process
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

,
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

i
do
regret
that

gone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
were
good
memories
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

have
been
laughing
for

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
glad
you
can
enjoy
my
S
tier
acting
skills
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
really
should
'
ve
been
an
actor
fr
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
alright
tho
,
I
saw
one
and
that
is
good
enough
to
tell
me
how
great
of
an
actor
you
were
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
tho
,
imagine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
hell
no
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
would
just
improvise
all
my
lines
all
the
time
,
and
it
'
d
be
terrible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
do
not
have
the
ryan
reynolds
in
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hahaha
well
it
’
s
never
too
late
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
its
long
gone
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
will
not
have
to
see
my
face
in
any
theatrical
performance
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
is
everything
associated
with
creativity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
im
really
not
good
at
that
stuff
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
you
are
not
alone
,
I
always
make
it
awkward
recording
anything
or
talking
in
front
of
a
group
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
but
that
one
video
you
showed
me
of
your
project
,
that
was
golden
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
immaculate
acting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
nah
,
that
was
fun
tho
I
will
tell
you
that
,
but
my
acting
,
nah
,
my
teacher
called
me
a
grandma
and
I
was
supposed
to
be
a
president
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
close
....
enough
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
basically
the
same
if
you
really
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Meh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
think
we
both
have
very
analytical
brains
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
numbers
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
say
that
because
there
is
nothing
for
me
on
the
opposite
spectrum
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
nooo
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
’
t
say
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
trust
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
saw
my
art
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
i
was
a
kid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
so
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
still
draw
bad
,
as
an
18
year
old
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
teacher
gave
me
a
good
grade
out
of
pity
of
me
trying
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
infinitely
better
than
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
lol
that
’
s
so
adorable
,
what
did
you
draw
that
was
that
bad
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
an
art
class
back
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nope
,
I
am
sure
you
draw
better
trust
me
,
I
get
excited
when
I
can
draw
anything
better
than
a
stick
figure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
used
to
stay
in
that
class
through
lunch
time
and
work
on
drawing
skills
really
hard
with
the
teacher
giving
me
tips
and
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
guess
they
recognized
the
effort
i
put
in
and
still
gave
me
a
decent
grading
just
from
proof
of
me
trying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
never
again
will
i
take
an
arts
class
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey

you
spent
time
and
tried
,
you
should
get
decent
grades
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
set
in
stone
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
my
art
requirement
was
fulfilled
for
college
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I

m

’
t

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

,
but
sometimes
it
’
s
okay

she
is
trying
her
best
and
I
am
sure
she
wants
to
be
around
you
too

time
,
it
’
s
alright
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
She
is
a
nurse
,
and

extremely
busy
so
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
she
'
s
on
the
grind
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

the
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

hours

in
the
dorm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

Death

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

no
for
some

to
reach
out
since
they
did
but
don
’
t
know
how
to
keep
the
conversation
going
.
I

[prabipyakurel]

at
not

[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
when
I
first
sent
you
that
discord
friend
request
,
I
was
like
he
probably
won
’
t
like
me
or
walk
to
me
normally
and
find
me
weird
but
the
more
we
talk
the
more
it
makes
me
realize
how
great
of
a
person
you
are
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
fr

when
we
met
at
bijesh
house
that
one
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh

i
was

'
m
just
awkward

was
also
not
anticipating
that
you
were
going
to
be

[prabipyakurel]
I

[prabipyakurel]

haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

a
nepali
party
,
99
%
of
the
time
im
there
for
the
food
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Always
nothing
else
to
do
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
could
care
less
about
the
event
unless
its
about
someone
close
to
me
or
that
I
know
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
same
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
idk
it
sounds
messed
up
but
at
this
point
,
I
'
ve
been
to
so
many
when
I
was
younger
and
I
'
m
tired
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
too
many
,
we
be
going
to
one
like
every
other
week
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
like
fr
,
before
covid
,
it
was
one
every
week
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
more
than
that
per
week
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Rightttt
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
also
,
this
is
gonna
sound
bad
but
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
some
of
the
venues
that
closed
down
were
the
ones
that
were
super
popular
,
but
also
had
terrible
food
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
absolutely
hated
going
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aha
lol
yep
some
were
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
like
an
event
and
i
'
ve
got
no
friends
,
and
plus
the
food
was
terrible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
would
actually
be
on
my
phone
the
entire
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
would
do
that
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
these
random
group
of
people
would
come
at
around
me
and
I
would
do
that
awkward
namaste
and
continue
staring
down
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
SAME
LOL
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
some
aunty
would
come
up
and
be
like
:
do
you
remember
me
when
you
were
like
-
1
years
old
I
held
you
and
you
cried
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

feeling
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

t
say
that
so

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Back
when
I

the
belly

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
You

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Or

Attended

place
.
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

you
to
just

if
you
finished
the
lecture

[sskarz]

So

[sskarz]
Man

gotta
switch
colleges
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
’
s
awesome
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
too
late
,
you
got
a
few
years
,
go
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
will
be
quite
an
experience
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ooooh
idk
,
we
’
ll
see
about
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
maybe
if
I
go
for
my
business
master
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Go
for
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
did
you
skip
gym
or
you
went
today
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
no
today
is
a
certified
rest
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
test
or
rest
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

no
gym
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Gotta
let

for
tomorrow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Rest
days
are
very
important
yk
,
people
that
go
everyday
of
the
week
compared
to
6
days
a
week
and
a
rest
day
,
the
latter
will
do
better
in
performance
and
muscle
gains
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Fatigue
builds
up
fast
and
impacts
you
easily
in
future
workouts
if
you
don
’
t
take
rest
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
*
rest
days

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
at

the

syllabus

so
you

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Don

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hopefully

its
a
indian
professor
,

probably
going
to
be
like
"

start
with
the
first
problem
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
nah
syllabus
always
comes
first
…
usually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Or
they
might
do
review
worst
case
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
won
’
t
just
jump
straight
into
it
thinking
you
know
all
the
derivatives
and
anti
derivatives
and
what
not
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
trust
me
,
you

ll
do
fine
.
Plus
I
bet
you
catch
on
easily
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

to
start
with
the
syllabus
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmm

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
yk
,
it
works
out
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
say
the
most
random
things
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
this
one
time
I
set
my
friends
up
and
the
just
stopped
talking
to
each
other
for
the
next
week
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
no
no
you
'
re
good
,
im
not
judging
at
all
or
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
?
what
happened
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
they
liked
each
other
and
it
was
pretty
obvious
in
the
group
chat
,
but
then
i
think
after
they
confronted
each
other
(
me
and
my
other
friend
tony
were
in
a
table
with
them
)
it
got
weird
and
I
talk
to
both
and
they
were
both
sharing
what
happened
in
those
conversation
,
Clearly
somthing
didnt
go
right
,
so
I
decided
to
be
a
little
therapist
and
help
,
but
they
didnt
wanna
do
anything
to
fix
it
,
now
if
they
are
just
friends
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
sitting
on
the
fence
taking
on
both
sides
and
then
it
just
randomly
ended
somehow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
that
is
very
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
one
of
the
interesting
ones
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
I
talk
to
both
and
they
talk
in
group
chat
so
we
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
even
if
someone
likes
someone
,
no
guarantee
that
they
will
like
being
around
them
closer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
sometimes
it
just
doesn
'
t
work
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
hey
,
glad
they
'
re
still
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
learned
stuff
from
them
,
yea
i
am
so
glad
they
are
still
friends
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
true
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah

'
ve
seen
that
happen
a
couple
of
times
with
some
of
my
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
similar
story
,
one
of
my
own
friends
got
setup
with
a
friend
of
a
friend
,
and
they
talked
for
like
3
weeks
and
then
just
stopped
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
what
happened
but
they
just
called
it
there
and
like
,
fair
enough
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
mean
you
got
to
wait
till
you
find
the
one
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
I
am
the
last
person
to
be
giving
any
sort
of
relationship
advice
,

I
will
still
be
like

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

things

a
clearer
light

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

im
not
hungry
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
know
a
cool
thing
about
the
body
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
alot
of
the
time
you
feel
hungry
,
almost
half
the
time
its
due
to
the
fact
that
you
'
re
just
dehydrated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
a
good
way
of
finding
out
which
one
it
is
,
is
literally
just
drinking
water
when
you
'
re
hungry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
are
,
then
you
need
food
.
if
not
,
then
you
just
needed
water
in
the
system
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Huh
that
’
s
cool
,
you
know
I
still
need
to
get
into
the
habit
of
drinking
water
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
fear
that
one
day
I
will
actually
be
extremely
dehydrated
and
like
fall
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
something
that
helped
me
is
keeping
my
water
bottle
in
sight
at
all
times
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hey
now
,
take
your
water
bottle
with
you
if
you
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
do
that
now
,
but
sometimes
it
just
doesn
’
t
happen
,
but
i
will
get
used
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
will
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
just
something
to
get
used
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
can
’
t
tell
you
how
many
time
my
family
has
told
me
to
drink
water
,
like
over
the
weekend
I
used
to
drink
water
after
breakfast
and
lunch
and
that
would
be
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
mom
had
to
call
and
remind
us
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Well

,
my
brother

it
,
and
yes
this
is
random

just
a
thought
,
to
live
in
a
world
with
no
one
else
sounds
scary
,
but
also
at
the
same
time
awesome
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
swear
younger
brothers
be
like

their
own
world

their
own
things

annoying
way

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh

all

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
hey
you
'
re
going
to
be
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
a
big
step
for
you
,
first
day
of
class
in
college
and
starting
the
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
its
like
any
other
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
i
am
not
ready
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
why
do
you
feel
so
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
part
of
you
isn
'
t
ready
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont
know
why
i
feel
that
way
,
but
like
no
part
of
me
is
ready
,
I
already
feel
like
I
am
behind
and
messing
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
haven
'
t
even
started
!
you
can
'
t
even
mess
up
even
if
you
wanted
to
,
you
can
'
t
even
fall
behind
if
it
hasn
'
t
started
.
[sskarz]
Imagine
everyone
else
right
now
,
in
your
freshman
class
.
Do
you
think
they
are
all
going
to
know
the
entire
class
material
,
or
even
be
expected
to
?
Of
course
not
!
It
'
s
the
same
thing
,
no
one
is
going
to
expect
you
to
know
the
entire
class
course
work
and
be
able
to
pass
calc
1
in
a
week
.
And
that
'
s
okay
!!!!
It
'
s
okay
to
not
know
everything
right
from
the
beginning
.
That
doesn
'
t
mean
you
'
re
going
to
fall
behind
at
all
.
Even
if
you
knew
everything
,
would
it
seriously
change
anything
?
The
nervousness
,
the
stress
,
the
feeling
of
not
being
able
to
perform
under
pressure
of
work
and
time
management
is
all
still
going
to
be
there
.
And
it
seems
scary
,
you
know
I
just
listed
all
of
those
things
and
I
probably
made
you
feel
even
worse
.
But
believe
me
when
I
say
,
you
'
re
not
expected
to
know
everything
.
I
know
you
well
enough
to
say
that
you
won
'
t
just
be
more
than
fine
,
but
you
'
re
going
to
excel
.
You
'
re
going
to
be
the
best
person
in
that
classroom
,
in
that
subject
,
and
everyone
will
see
you
as
the
smart
kid
in
class
!
You
are
nothing
short
of
incredible
potential
,
you
'
ve
proved
it
to
not
just
me
,
but
everyone
.
[sskarz]
Don
'
t
let
your
fears
taunt
or
control
you
,
remember
you
are
either
your
biggest
ally
,
or
the
worst
enemy
.
And
what
changes
from
an
enemy
to
ally
,
is
a
change
of
perspective
.
[sskarz]
So
take
this
change
of
perspective
,
the
perspective
of
being
okay
with
going
into
something
knowing
nothing
,
but
knowing
that
you
will
know
more
each
day
to
conquer
the
next
challenge
.
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
I
can
guarantee
you
that
after
a
week
,
you
will
slowly
adapt
to
this
new
style
of
learning
,
living
,
and
everything
in
between
.
It
'
s
just
life
,
it
'
s
how
we
live
everyday
.
We
all
don
'
t
know
what
we
'
re
going
to
do
at
every
moment
of
the
next
day
,
no
one
does
.
There
'
s
no
way
to
prepare
for
such
a
thing
if
you
really
think
about
it
.
Yeah
you
can
plan
it
out
,
but
will
you
know
every
step
you
take
,
every
breath
that
you
take
,
the
movement
of
your
eyes
.
There
are
so
many
things
to
keep
in
mind
,
and
it
starts
to
become
overwhelming
.
[sskarz]
The
perspective
of
being
okay
when
in
the
dark
,
when
you
'
re
just
lost
,
it
'
s
helped
me
too
.
It
helps
you
be
okay
even
when
times
,
it
all
just
looks
so
daunting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Maybe
for
you
it
might
be
just
the
complete
opposite
of
everything
I
'
ve
said
,
if
that
'
s
the
case
then
feel
free
to
tell
me
and
yell
at
me
and
everything
.
But
odds
are
,
you
will
be
okay
!
More
than
that
,
you
will
thrive
.
Keep
that
in
your
mental
as
you
go
and
learn
tomorrow
,
go
in
with
the
mindset
of
being
ready
to
learn
and
take
on
whatever
comes
your
way
.
It
'
ll
help
with
the
anxiety
and
stress
that
follows
.
It
won
'
t
totally
leave
you
,
but
trust
me
when
I
say
it
really
helps
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
words
for
you
literally
you
are
the
best
person
in
the
world
.
You
gonna
make
me
cry
,
thank
you
so
much
,
I
will
keep
your
words
in
mind
and
I
will
go
to
class
tomorrow
with
positive
thoughts
.
I
am
sorry
if
I
made
you
write
a
lot
lol
,
you
are
such
a
beautiful
soul
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Awwwwww
no
no
don
'
t
cry
!!
I
'
m
sorry
,
I
didn
'
t
mean
to
get
that
reaction
from
you
.
I
want
to
empower
you
,
to
show
you
that
you
have
what
it
takes
to
be
the
best
,
to
be
the
one
that
conquers
,
to
be
so
confident
in
your
own
abilities
.
It
'
s
hard
,
there
'
s
a
reason
why
its
the
highest
peak
in
Maslow
'
s
Hierarchy
of
Needs
.
When
you
reach
that
level
,
you
become
an
unstoppable
person
.
A
person
who
'
s
will
can
'
t
change
,
who
'
s
mind
can
'
t
be
changed
from
what
they
want
to
do
,
and
you
become
the
best
.
You
have
what
it
takes
,
I
know
you
do
.
I
believe
in
you
,
and
you
'
re
one
of
the
smartest
,
kindest
,
nicest
,
clumsiest
people
I
'
ve
ever
known
.
But
that
makes
you
you
,
and
that
makes
me
want
to
uplift
your
spirits
when
you
'
re
down
.
So
when
I
say
that
you
will
be
the
best
,
god
damn
it
you
'
re
going
to
be
the
best
!
Put
that
in
your
own
head
,
it
may
seem
a
little
egotistical
and
totally
not
humble
,
but
sometimes
you
need
that
fire
.
That
confidence
will
help
you
conquer
those
problems
that
seem
like
brick
walls
.
It
'
s
a
crazy
powerful
tool
that
I
believe
in
.
[sskarz]

When
I
'
m
feeling
overwhelmed
,
I
like
to
think
about
how
I
didn
'
t
want
to
let
all
my
efforts
in
life
go
to
waste
.
You
know
,
I
get
this
feeling
with
basic
chores
sometimes
,
and
it
sounds
ridiculous
I
know
.
There
have
been
times
where
I
'
ve
been
so
mentally
and
physically
exhausted
that
there
was
nothing
more
than
just
wanting
to
be
erased
from
the
world
for
a
couple
days
.
Just
so
I
had
no
responsibilities
,
nothing
to
think
about
,
and
I
could
ease
my
mind
.
But
I
can
'
t
do
that
,
I
'
ve
got
a
future
to
fight
for
.
A
future
where
I
'
m
successful
in
life
,
whatever
that
may
be
.
A
future
that
my
old
past
self
would
look
up
at
and
couldn
'
t
fathom
the
idea
of
being
there
.
That
'
s
what
I
fight
for
,
every
single
day
.
And
it
gets
me
through
any
challenge
that
throws
itself
at
me
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
All
of
this
strife
and
struggle
will
seem
like
a
good
memory
down
the
road
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
so
much
,
I
feel
better
and
ready
now
to
be
honest
,
yea
you
are
right
,
I
can
do
this
.
Imma
walk
to
class
tomorrow
with
confidence
and
be
ready
for
whatever
happens
in
there
.
God
you
should
be
a
therapist

something

A

Sisyphus

The
guy
that

the
eternal
punishment
of
forever
rolling
up
the
boulder
uphill

He
never
stopped
,
no

how
tired
he
got
,
no

if
his
legs
were
bound
to
disintegrate
,
he
kept
pushing
that
rock
up
that
hill

just
a
life
hack
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
the
#
1
thing
that
really
helped
me
in
my
19
years
of
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
it
took
me
about
17
years
to
realize
it
fully
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
pray
that
only
good
things
come
for
you
always
.
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
Hey

me
get
through
this
dumb
situation
,
you
have
all
my
respect
and
everything
.
You
have
done
a
lot
for
me
really
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Took
my
mind
off
a
lot
of
things
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
why
I
'
m
here
for
you
,
its
why
I
keep
going
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Helping
you
and
others
just
fuels
me
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
What
are
you
doing
right
now
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ironically
listening
to
some
sad
and
soothing
music
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
dw
I
'
m
not
sad
or
anything
,
it
'
s
just
...
that
thing
yk
?
idk
how
to
explain
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
no
I
do
that
sometimes
too
,
I
be
having
a
relaxing
day
and
I
my
ears
are
like
the
saddest
lyrics
playing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
just
something
about
it
,
really
calms
me
down
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
all
feels
like
its
going
to
be
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
completely
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nope
you
first
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nuh
uh
i
went
first
last
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
didn
’
t
😠
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Please
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
uhh
i
got
the
receipts
yes
i
didddddddd
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ah
well
i
can
'
t
argue
with
you
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
you
really
can
’
t
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Now
you
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
There
'
s
an
album
I
listen
to
when
I
feel
like
I
'
m
really
stressed
or
anxious
.
It
'
s
called
Circles
by
Mac
Miller
,
and
it
was
his
last
ever
project
.
But
what
'
s
so
special
about
it
is
the
way
it
feels
like
he
speaks
directly
to
you
,
in
like
a
therapeutic
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
so
I
just
put
that
album
on
,
but
not
because
I
'
m
stressed
or
anxious
,
just
that
it
'
s
nice
to
hear
someone
talking
like
they
'
re
going
through
the
same
things
and
living
through
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
if
you
could
tell
yet
,
but
I
have
a
deep
connection
with
music
and
how
it
affects
my
moods
and
attitudes
towards
things
.
And
this
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
ones
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
that
’
s
smart
,
but
hey
I
’
m
here
if
you
need
advice
or
anything
,
I
will
give
you
everything
I
got
with
minimal
spelling
errors
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
I
know
,
don
'
t
worry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
get
that
,
so
music
has
a
way
of
connecting
to
you
in
a
deeper
way
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
just
how
I
feel
and
exemplify
my
emotions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
why
I
collect
vinyls
.
Albums
that
have
either
changed
my
life
,
or
I
'
ve
connected
to
on
a
deep
level
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
how
I
remind
myself
of
what
music
has
done
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
as
long
as
it
makes
you
feel
better
and
heals
you
,
you
do
you
,
music
is
awesome
,
I
love
listening
to
random
music
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
This
things
are
really
pretty
tho
,
like
I
know
nothing
about
them
but
they
are
a
big
part
of
your
life
and
that
’
s
really
cool
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
started
your
connection
to
music
in
high
school
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
are
pretty
nice
haha
,
thank
you
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Actually
right
after
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
I
was
going
into
college
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
just
as
anxious
and
nervous
as
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
never
really
listened
to
music
prior
to
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
it
really
was
that
thing
that
helped
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
just
helped
me
deal
with
emotions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
so
it
has
been
like
a
year
or
2
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
was
talking
to
you
then
,
I
would
have
told
you
that
you
would
have
succeeded
in
every
way
possible
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
For
sure
,
some
music
are
really
captivating
and
like
you
can
relate
to
it
a
lot
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
,
well
honestly
,
this
sounds
weird
,
but
I
'
ve
made
more
progress
as
a
person
in
every
regard
in
the
last
2
years
,
than
I
'
ve
ever
had
in
my
years
prior
to
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
comparing
myself
to
how
I
was
when
I
was
younger
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
'
s
like
night
and
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
could
go
back
in
time
and
show
you
,
you
wouldn
'
t
believe
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
What
was
so
different
about
you
high
school
years
and
post
high
school
years
into
college
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
don
’
t
have
to
answer
that
,
hope
I
am
not
being
nosy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
you
'
re
not
at
all
,
again
,
I
'
m
an
open
book
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
ask
away
,
I
'
ve
got
nothing
to
hide
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
U
still
there
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
I
could
say
it
in
one
word
.
I
'
d
say
Perspective
.
[sskarz]
I
used
to
be
so
overly
negative
.
I
hated
how
I
looked
,
how
I
acted
,
how
I
did
things
,
how
I
thought
.
During
my
middle
school
years
,
I
fell
into
a
depressive
hole
and
it
caused
me
to
set
my
entire
life
on
fire
.
There
were
times
where
I
contemplated
running
away
from
everything
and
everyone
,
and
doing
worse
things
.
For
a
few
years
,
I
loathed
every
day
.
The
friends
I
talked
to
I
couldn
'
t
care
less
about
,
the
things
I
did
and
said
held
no
weight
.
I
was
just
so
...
like
I
felt
as
if
everything
was
just
so
much
higher
and
I
felt
like
it
was
impossible
to
climb
out
of
that
hole
yk
?
When
you
feel
like
you
'
re
so
low
,
that
the
bottom
floor
is
closer
than
getting
out
,
so
you
just
sink
.
This
carried
with
me
all
the
way
into
high
school
,
till
about
Junior
year
of
high
school
.
I
started
to
realize
what
I
was
doing
to
myself
and
how
it
also
impacted
those
around
me
.
It
wasn
'
t
enough
to
fully
make
me
realize
,
but
it
made
me
change
slowly
.
Of
course
I
couldn
'
t
share
these
feelings
with
anyone
,
I
kept
it
all
to
myself
and
put
on
a
fake
smile
for
years
on
end
.
And
then
high
school
ended
,
and
my
life
took
a
turn
.
My
perspective
just
changed
,
like
I
just
had
to
snap
out
of
it
.
And
ever
since
then
,
I
'
ve
changed
my
entire
character
,
my
entire
person
,
and
my
entire
perspective
of
how
I
view
life
and
people
and
family
and
friends
and
loved
ones
.
It
sounds
crazy
,
and
honestly
,
I
haven
'
t
reflected
this
hard
in
a
while
,
but
it
'
s
true
.
You
wouldn
'
t
have
liked
me
if
you
knew
who
I
was
back
then
.
How
can
you
like
someone
that
didn
'
t
like
themselves
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Thankfully
,
I
'
m
nowhere
even
close
to
who
I
used
to
be
.
I
'
m
so
much
happier
being
who
I
am
today
,
than
I
would
ever
have
been
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
love
myself
to
the
upmost
degree
,
and
my
self
esteem
has
never
ever
been
higher
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Even
when
I
make
mistakes
today
,
I
just
think
about
the
shit
I
'
ve
already
gone
and
done
,
and
it
all
seems
so
miniscule
.
Like
nothing
could
compare
to
what
those
years
did
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
know
I
'
m
really
putting
myself
out
there
,
and
you
know
maybe
this
isn
'
t
what
you
wanted
to
hear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
I
want
to
be
honest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
This
is
who
I
was
,
this
is
who
I
am
today
.
And
this
is
just
me
,
all
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
'
s
why
I
preach
so
much
about
optimism
and
perspective
,
because
that
'
s
what
got
me
out
of
all
of
that
.
Without
that
,
I
wouldn
'
t
be
who
I
am
today
,
not
even
close
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
First
of
all
thank
you
for
sharing
,
it
takes
a
lot
to
reflect
on
the
time
that
has
passed
.
And
I
am
so
sorry
that
you
had
to
go
through
so
much
but
you
got
out
of
it
and
now
you
are
doing
your
best
.
And
one
thing
you
gotta
remember
is
to
love
yourself
always
,
I
mean
you
always
here
from
others
but
from
how
much
I
know
you
,
you
are
like
so
amazing
.
And
yea
you
might
have
felt
like
you
wanted
to
be
someone
else
,
look
different
,
and
maybe
see
things
differently
,
but
you
got
through
those
things
on
your
own
and
it
already
tells
me
how
strong
of
a
person
you
are
.
Thank
you
for
sharing
again
,
I
will
keep
this
to
myself
dw
,
I
am
not
telling
anyone
.
And
your
smile
is
precious
,
keep
it
on
.
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
I
hope
it
didn
'
t
change
of
how
you
think
of
me
.
I
understand
if
it
did
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
hey
you
were
perfect
the
time
I
met
you
,
you
still
are
,
and
will
remain
perfect
as
long
as
I
live
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
'
m
sorry
for
putting
all
of
this
on
your
shoulder
too
,
I
just
kind
of
spilled
out
like
a
leaking
bottle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
didn
’
t
change
how
I
think
or
you
and
won
’
t
ever
,
it
was
part
of
your
growth
and
I
respect
you
for
sharing
,
it
shows
that
you
are
past
it
and
you
have
thrived
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
don
’
t
ever
think
of
it
that
way
,
it
’
s
okay
to
share
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
I
'
m
the
farthest
thing
from
perfect
,
I
'

through
a

to
make
who
I
am
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

a
name
or
a
hint
,
do
I
know
the
person
or
no
?
Just
curious
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hmmmmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
technically
I
'
ve
given
a
hint
already
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
'
ll
leave
it
at
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Where
,
I
didn
’
t
get
no
hint
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Tell
me
the
hint
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
its

it
outright
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
probably
don
’
t
even
know
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
leave
it
up
to
interpretation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
who
knows
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
maybe
they
don
'
t
even
exist
in
the
first
place
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
literally
gonna
make
me
reread
2
months
worth
of
text
to
see
a
hint
that
you
may
or
may
not
have
said
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
world
may

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
sounds
more
like
a
poem
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Where
is
the
riddle
in
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
I
told
you
,
it
would
become
incredibly
obvious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Maybe
it
'
ll
click
with
you
one
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
if
it
doesn
'
t
,
so
be
it
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
why
don
’
t
you
wanna
share
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
figure
it
out
somehow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
ve
already
shared
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
just
need
to
think
a
bit
harder
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
poem
should
give
you
a
direction
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Pinned
a
message
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
technically
,
it
points
to
the
exact
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
solve
the
poem
,
you
solve
this
entire
question
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
really
can
'
t
give
you
more
than
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
How
will
I
know
if
I
am
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
'
ll
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Think
back
to
what
I
said
,
and
perhaps
you
'
ll
see
something
is
out
of
place
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
no
,
I
don
'
t
mean
the
poem
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
About
what
you
said
today
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Who
said
it
limits
to
today
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😈
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
fr
evil
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
I
have
an
idea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Maybe
you
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Who
will
actually
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
may
just
be
stupid
for
thinking
of
it
that
way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
When
you
know
,
you
'
ll
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
poem
is
staring
and
screaming
the
answer
,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
...
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
a
little
thinking
exercise
built
just
for
you
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
read
all
the
lines
and
they
all
sound
different
except
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
idk
if
i
broke
it
down
correctly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
I
can
neither
confirm
nor
deny
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
When
you
are
sure
,
you
take
the
leap
of
faith
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
By
leap
of
faith
,
you
mean
share
the
name
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Do
I
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
way
too
annoying
at
this
point
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
confident
you
'
ll
figure
it
all
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
made
it
specifically
for
you
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
here
'
s
my
last
hint
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
what
I
'
ve
been
talking
about
all
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
**
Perspective
**
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
you
figured
it
out
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
How
confident
are
you
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Not
sure
,
I
might
just
be
imagining
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
could
be
all
wrong
for
all
you
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
suggesting
anything
,
just
realizing
it
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
a
little
confident
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
starting
to
see
it
a
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well
once
you
'
re
100
%
confident
,
you
'
ll
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
personally
,
I
'
m
really
proud
of
that
poem
I
made
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
a
really
good
poem
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
liked
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
if
you
realize
it
fully
,
it
'
s
kind
of
ingenious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
,
just
unsure
about
the
confidence
level
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
you
haven
'
t
completely
solved
the
poem
then
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
have
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Damn
that
was
fast
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
just
a
part
of
it
that
I
am
looking
at
over
and
over
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
What
line
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
I
could
ask
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
“
The
letter
that
spelled
thee
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Really
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
If
you
solved
it
,
that
should
'
ve
been
the
easiest
thing
to
figure
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well
it
should
'
ve
been
obvious
if
you
solved
everything
else
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
a
train
of
thought
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Glad
its
got
you
thinking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
it

at
3
,

sociology
reading

save
it
for
after

(
its

so
I
think
I
will
just
do
that
,
go
do
laundry
if
I
can
and
eat
lunch
,
then
maybe
take
a
short
nap
before
getting
to
class
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Sounds
like
a
solid
plan
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

nap
is
a
maybe
,

dont
wanna
accidently
miss
my
first

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
nice
nice
,
well
my
class
was
kinda
weird
,
It
was
about
300
students
in
there
,
that
is
massive
first
of
all
.
And
second
of
all
,
he
is
scaring
the
shit
out
of
me
,
its
like
he
makes
it
sounds
like
we
will
be
fine
but
at
the
same
time
he
be
like
"
just
because
you
do
well
on
the
quizzes
does
not
mean
you
will
get
a
good
grade
on
the
finals
"
and
stuff
like
that
.
I
mean
he
just
went
over
the
syllabus
today
,
but
ugh
i
already
kinda
think
he
gonna
be
that
one
painful
professor
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
got
an
updated
schedule
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
yeah
they
'
re
not
trying
to
scare
you
,
its
true
like
if
you
did
all
the
quizzes
and
got
100s
,
but
failed
the
final
,
you
might
fail
the
class
type
of
deal
.
Honestly
tho
,
it
'
s
never
been
an
issue
like
ever
,
so
don
'
t
worry
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
See
,
I
told
you
they
'
d
only
go
over
the
syllabus
for
the
first
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
300
students
?
damn
that
must
be
a
huge
lecture
hall
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Pinned
a
message
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
What
did
you
change
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
discussions
,
I
see
that
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
i
see
,
yea
because
he
was
going
on
and
on
about
how
everything
will
be
like
,
and
he
is
all
like
,
you
know
you
might
fail
and
you
might
pass
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
it
was
just
100
,
that
hall
was
not
that
big
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
surprised
when
he
said
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
that
'
s
pretty
nuts
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
a
fan
of
lecture
hall
type
classrooms
just
cause
its
hard
to
ask
questions
directly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
he
was
like
,
i
dont
personally
take
questions
but
for
now
I
can
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
will
be
hard
to
get
personal
help
from
the
dude
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
,
are
all
of
your
classes
in
lecture
halls
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
had
that
class
today
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
went
around
to
check
the
rest
of
my
classes
after
and
this
one
class
is
like
around
the
corner
in
this
foresty
area
and
I
just
couldn
'
t
go
in
there
alone
,
so
that
is
a
tomorrow
5pm
problem
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
also
saw
a
dead
squirrel
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhh

its
like
you
know
in
harry
potter
when
they
go
outside
of
the
castle
and
then
find
hagrid
'
s
house

the
second
one
,
you
can
hear
the
water
underneath
the
wood
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
like
a
narrow
bridge
that
goes
through
a
creek
and
like
trees
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
wow
cool
,
did
you
just
start
a
conversation
with
them
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
are
like
a
chill
person
,
so
they
probably
just
connected
to
you
easily
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
!
like
in
the
morning
,
I
overheard
a
guy
talk
about
replacing
some
of
his
pc
parts
and
I
just
joined
in
,
and
the
conversation
was
smooth
,
and
now
i
have
him
in
my
contacts
and
we
know
each
other
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
'
re
chill
too
,
idk
why
anyone
would
think
you
'
d
be
weird
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wow
conversation
about
PC
parts
,
but
glad
you
met
someone
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
was
a
computer
science
class
,
what
else
do
you
expect
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
i
bet
you
just
slid
into
the
conversation
and
it
clicked
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
its
something
im
super
familiar
with
and
i
like
partaking
in
those
kinds
of
conversations
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
i
like
to
do
is
get
to
classes
earlier
than
anyone
,
and
those
that
come
through
like
I
'
ll
try
and
talk
to
them
just
to
ensure
I
know
at
least
1
other
person
in
the
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
doesn
'
t
have
to
be
anything
meaningful
at
all
,
just
so
they
know
me
and
I
know
them
so
its
easier
for
us
to
communicate
later
down
the
road
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
planting
seeds
yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
i
got
there
earlier
too
,
but
like
there
were
a
few
people
there
already
talking
and
it
seemed
rude
to
interrupt
so
i
just
sat
and
waited
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
*
maybe
i
am
the
weird
one
for
interrupting
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
thought
goes
through
my
head
,
like
i
meet
anyone
new
,
and
i
have
that
thought
that
goes
like
"
wait
what
if
i
am
being
nosy
or
disturbing
"
so
i
just
smile
and
wait
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
we
are
opposites
,
i
'
ll
just
strike
up
a
conversation
or
just
join
in
for
the
sake
of
joining
in
,
usually
before
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
best
time
to
make
friends
are
before
class
starts
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
even
like
the
sacred
method
,
ask
for
a
pencil
because
you
"
don
'
t
have
one
"
and
just
go
from
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
coming
into
college
and
asking
for
a
pencil
on
the
first
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
sanskar
,
really
,
would
not
have
expected
that
fom
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
'
d
be
surprised
of
how
often
that
happens
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
which
part
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
the
pencil
trick
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
cmon
its
the
easiest
thing
to
do
if
nothing
else
is
gonna
work
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
the
rest
matches
your
extroverted
personality
and
I
can
imagine
you
make
friends
fairly
easily
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
works
so
often
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mmmmm
I
'
m
like
an
ambivert
lowkey
,
like
if
im
in
my
room
,
i
don
'
t
want
anyone
bothering
me
physically
,
but
if
im
outside
i
got
that
social
battery
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
*
till
that
runs
out

doesn
'
t
happen
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

facial
expression
💀
[sskarz]

out
lmfao
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

position
in
front
of
them
,

,
"
so
what
if
i
borrowed
that
pen
of
yours
?"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh

god

'
t
try
it
,
its
obvious
you
don
'
t
know
the
sacred
technique
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no

like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
s
someone
sitting
to

right
,

cool
to
talk
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
whisper
as
if
im
trying
not
to
disturb
anyone
,
for
a
pencil
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
nah
I
am
not
asking
for
anything
,
I
will
just
go
say
hi
and
ask
them
some
math
question
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
then
after
class
,
i
will
return
that
pencil
,
and
then
talk
with
them
afterwards
about
the
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
mean
that
works
too
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
What
if
they
just
leave
and
let
you
keep
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
doesn
'
t
happen
,
like
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
imagine
whispering
into
a
random
persons
ear
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
swear
this
technique
rarely
fails
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
just
tap
them
on
the
shoulder
and
then
ask
them
in
a
low
voice
,
not
necessarily
going
into
their
ear
canal
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
LMAO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh

will
try
that
if

needed
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💯
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
got
like
a
95
%
success
rate
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
that
'
s
not
really
my
go
to
,
that
'
s
like
last
resort
and
i
really
want
to
talk
to
a
specific
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
usually
just
ask
someone
somthing
about
the
class
and
its
easy
from
there

[sskarz]

i

,
but
it
randomly
happens
not
because
i
want
it
to
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
sometimes
it
can
lead
to
beautiful
friendships
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
met
alot
of
my
really
good
friends
because
they
came
up
to
me
,
and
i
had
no
interest
in
talking
to
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
as
i
learned
they
were
pretty
cool
people
so
it
all
worked
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
happened
a
lot
in
high
school
,
i
would
be
bumping
into
the
most
random
people
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
college
is
literally
just
high
school
,
except
everyone
is
a
little
more
grown
up
and
there
'
s
so
much
more
freedom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
starting
to
feel
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

feel
more
comfortable

[prabipyakurel]
Lol

scares
me
when
I
see
those
situations
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
you

'
t
it
would

of
situations

gotcha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
um
completely
unrelated
topic
here
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
you
hear
about
how
india
landed
a
spacecraft
on
the
moon
today
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
really
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
'
re
the
4th
country
in
the
world
to
do
so
,
they
won
the
race
against
russia
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wait
let
me
search
that
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
russia
'
s
spacecraft
actually
failed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
i
thought
russia
would
be
far
ahead
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
india
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
pretty
facinating
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
as
big
moment
for
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
happy
to
see
some
brown
representation
on
the
moon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
actually
unfortunate
for
what
happened
to
their
spacecraft
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
it
was
heading
towards
the
moon
,
but
something
went
awry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
true
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
the
entire
thing

got
destroyed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
crashed
into
the
moon
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yikes

like
they
are
russia
i
feel
like
will
try
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
maybe
not
,
especially
because
of
how
the
war
with
ukraine
is
happening
,
their
space
agency
is
losing
even
more
funding
now
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
might
just
collapse
for
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
which
is
crazy
to
think
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
right
,
actually
that
might
be
correct
,
yea
the
war
is
like
messing
them
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
and
their
economy
is
just
tanking
so
,

who
knows
what
'
s
going
to
happen
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
about
their
future
,
they
messes
up
bad

[prabipyakurel]

he
is
really
a
monster
I
wont

him
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

to
suffer
,

torture
chamber

like
,

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
going

of
the
words

to
you

,

from
the
heart
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
happened
,
your
confidence
was
through
the
roof
yesterday
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
mean
it
wasn
'
t
like
through
the
roof
or
anything
like
that
,
I
just
had
soon
forgot
about
it
afterwards
,
and
I
just
got
reminded
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
know
its
kind
of
a
big
deal
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
still
has
me
thinking
too
,
lol
I
have
been
going
back
to
our
conversations
to
see
what
I
missed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Have
you
really
solved
the
entire
riddle
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
I
have
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
just
,
scared
that
if
you
get
it
wrong
,
then
I
'
m
wrong
too
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
so
dumb
for
making
this
all
so
cryptic
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
’
s
what
I
am
afraid
of
too
,
what
if
I
say
a
name
and
it
’
s
not
the
correct
one
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
want
to
tell
you
but
I
don
'
t
know
if
its
the
right
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
'
s
what
I
'
m
afraid
of
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Got
for
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
up
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
If
you
feel
comfortable
sharing
,
i
hope
I
am
not
forcing
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
'
re
not
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
just
thinking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
I
am
thinking
of
something
but
don
’
t
know
if
you
will
like
it
or
not
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Same
here

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Quite
the
predicament

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
jeopardy
music
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
,
I
feel
like
it
'
d
kind
of
sound
anti
-
climactic
if
I
just
texted
it
to
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
at
the
same
time
you
'
d
probably
be
annoyed
if
I
didn
'
t
say
anything
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
,
you
share
it
how
you
want
to
and
how
you
would
like
to
,
I
am
open
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
would
like
to
say
it
face
to
face
but
that
'
s
not
possible
,
just
to
build
up
the
suspense
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
really
isn
’
t
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Prabi
,
you
are
one
of
the
nicest
people
I
'
ve
ever
met
in
my
life
.
You
are
always
there
to
brighten
up
my
days
.
Even
when
I
can
be
too
honest
at
times
,
you
accepted
me
for
who
I
am
and
I
honestly
couldn
'
t
ask
for
any
better
.
You
truly
are
amazingier
😂
[sskarz]
I
won
'
t
try
to
hide
anymore
and
I
will

have
.
[sskarz]
I

you
,
Prabi

You

ve
got
the
nicest
smile
,
the
kindest
heart
,
and
the
best

ve
seen
on
anyone
.
You
'
re
the
only
one
I
could
tolerate
being
messed
with
all
day
and
everyday
,
and
it
'
s
because
I
love
talking
with
you
.
I
don
'
t
know
any
other
person
who
I
could
talk
to
hours
on
end
and
always
come
out
with
a
smile
.
You
'
re
beautiful
,
smart
as
all
hell
,
and
even
a
little
clumsy
but
it
just
cements
this
in
my
heart
more
.
[sskarz]
Now
I
just
want
to
say
,
if
this
isn
'
t
what
you
thought
it
was
going
to
be
,
I

All
I
ask
for
is
your
honesty
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
First
of
all
,
I
always
thought
you
were
cute
and
so
sweet
,
and
when
you
sent
that
poem
and
said
that
it
was
specifically
for
me
,
i
wanted
to
tell
you
I
liked
you
on
the
spot
,
but
lol
I
was
so
scared
to
tell
you
in
case
you
didn
’
t
think
that
way
about
me
.
No
like
I
like
you
a
lot
,
and
you
are
my
first
.
No
need
to
apologize
,
honestly
you
are
so
sweet
and
funny
and
smart
and
everything
.
Like
god
made
you
for
me
god
dammit
,
I
just
didn
’
t
want
to
share
yesterday
because
I
thought
that
only
I
had
feelings
for
you
,
but
I
am
glad
you
shared
.
You
are
amazinger
and
you
know

The
way
I
feel
talking
to
you
is
unmatched
to
any
other
conversation
I
ever
have
,
and
lol
I
have
made
your
spelling
worse
the
more
we
talk
😂
but
overall
yes
I
like
you
a
lot
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

I
'
m
so
relieved
right
now
,
you
have
no
idea
I
was
pacing
in
my
room
about
to
eat
my
own
hands
alive
.
I
'
m
so
glad
you
feel
the
same
way
,
I
really
wanted
to
tell
you
in
person
somehow
but
it
'
s
just
not
possible
and
I
done
did
the
mistake
of
going
too
far
yesterday
with
the
easy
riddle
to
solve
haha
.
But
I
'
m
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
so
glad
,
I
really
thought
I
was
the
only
one
holding
these
feelings
back
I
won
'
t
lie
😂
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

you

and
I

Oh
nah
when
you
started
typing
I
had
to
go
back
down
from
my
bunk
bed
,
like
walk
around
and
panic
while
my
roommates
were
doing
their
nighttime
routine
in
the
restroom
.
Like
I
was
stressing
and
sweating
😂,
and
you
aren
’
t
the
only
one
holding
back
feelings
,
that
was
me
like
a
while
back
.
And
when
you
came
over
to
my
house
,
I
couldn
’
t
show
it
because
lol
everyone
was
there
,
but
I
just
wanted
to
hug
you
and
tell
you
that
you
were
the
cutest
person
.

OMG
if
I
didn
'
t
need
to
leave
so
early
,
I
really
wanted
to
talk
to
you
.
Like
when
you
came
and
said
goodbye
,
I
just
wanted
to
have
that
conversation
but
I
...
got
a
little
scared
I
won
'
t
lie
.
You
know
when
we
talk
it
all
seems
so
obvious
now
,
but
I
swear
to
you
I
thought
I
was
the
only
one
on
this
side
of
our
conversations
that
had
these
feelings
I
couldn
'
t
share
!
Really
,
I
would
'
ve
much
rather
told
you
in
person
but
I
just
missed
my
chance
,
so
forgive
me
for
telling
you

dad

saying
something
to
me

door
to
say
bye
to
you
,
and
I
listened
to
him
again
after
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

'
ve
talked
to
you
for
a

longer
before
I

when
you
asked
me

I
found
someone
worthy
,
I
was
about
to
be
like
“

”
but
I
got
scared
so
I
stuck
to
“
maybe
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
you
said
yes
so
I
wanted
to
confirm
if
it
was
me
or
not
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

bringing
you
to
roller
coaster
rides
and
thrilling
stuff
you
know
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
We
will
start
slow
,
also
I
don
’
t
think
I
am
allowed
to
date
,
and
I
understand
if
that
is
the
deal
breaker
but
I
can
’
t
let
my
family
know
about
this
until
like
we
are
both
successful
and
everything
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Can
we
keep
this
a
secret
?
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

Cool
,
thank
you
for
understanding
,
like
my
parents
would
love
you
,
you
are
so
amazing
,
but
I
think
we
got
to
reach
our
goals
and
be
of
age
,
then
we
can
slowly
you
know
let
people
know
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
allowed
to
date
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Um
...
you

I

myself
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
get
like
super
mixed
signals
from
my
parents
and
everyone
,
I
'
ve
got
no
clue
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Some
days
they
'
ll
be
like
,
omg
sanskar
you
have
to
find
someone
otherwise
you
'
re
gonna
die
alone
!
or
some
days
they
'
ll
be
like
,
you
need
to
focus
on
your
studies
and
worry
about
that
stuff
later
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
lol
,
oooo
the
stare
my
family
would
give
me
if
they
knew
about
this
conversation
,
nah
uh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
if
I
'
m
honest
,
if
I
ever
let
them
know
,
I
don
'
t
think
they
'
d
be
opposed
to
it
at
all
,
they
really
liked
the
idea
of
you
being
with
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

some
music
and
everyone
was
dead
silent
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

speaks
up
and
he
just
says
,
you
know
she
'
s
right
for
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
have
to
pretend
like

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
he
straight
up
says
,
Prabi
,

Hey

hope
I

not
disturbing
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
was
your
day
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
not
at
all
,
you
are
never
disturbing
me
.
My
day
was
pretty
busy
,
I
had
the
other
4
classes
today
and
I
MADE
FRIENDS
.
I
loved
my
sociology
class
,
it
was
very
active
and
discussion
based
.
Then
I
went
to
my
english
philosophy
class
which
was
pretty
fun
,
the
teacher
was
awesome
.
After
that
I
hurried
back
to
get
some
lunch
after
like
12
to
around
1
,
then
left
to
my
discussions
from
4
to
5
o
clock
and
then
ran
all
the
way
across
campus
to
go
to
my
history
class
fom
5
to
6
.
After
that
i
came
back
,
said
bye
to
one
roommate
and
then
went
to
eat
dinner
and
said
bye
to
my
other
roommate
.
Now
I
am
alone
and
have
no
one
to
talk
to
,
sorry
for
getting
back
late
,
was
having
a
little
convo
with
my
mom
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
,
did
you
share
some
of
your
wisdom
to
the
underclassmen
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
seeeeeeee
I
told
you
'
d
make
friends
,
and
you
were
doubting
smh
haha
,
In
all
seriousness
tho
,
sounds
like
you
had
an
amazing
day
!
See
,
college
can
be
real
fun
when
you
get
these
experiences
.
Oh
and
no
worries
,
you
don
'
t
need
to
say
sorry
ever
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
today
'
s
been
a
day
lol
,
I
'
ve
been
working
for
like
12
hours
straight
and
I
just
got
to
sit
down
and
relax
.
So
I
started
my
day
at
around
6
am
and
headed
to
the
gym
,
then
back
home
,
showered
,
then
arrived
at
campus
at
8
.
I
organized
a
team
yesterday
to
setup
this
tabling
event
you
saw
from
my
instagram
post
,
so
we
set
that
up
and
it
took
us
about
an
hour
and
a
half
to
get
materials
and
setup
.
Then
I
had
to
present
to
a
lecture
hall
of
100
students
about
our
club
and
I
had
to
do
that
by
myself
because
my
partner
forgot
about
it
lol
.
After
that
,
I
went
and
sat
around
my
club
booth
for
about
2
hours
and
helped
people
sign
up
and
told
them
about
our
club
.
And
then
I
had
another
class
presentation
in
my
actual
class
,
and
after
my
class
was
over
,
I
headed
to
the
library
to
get
the
work
done
from
that
class
.
It
was
like
4pm
at
this
point
,
so
I
headed
to
Sam
'
s
Club
and
grabbed
some
workout
protein
stuff
because
I
was
running
out
,
and
that
was
busy
so
it
took
me
till
5
:
30
to
come
back
home
.
Once
I
was
back
home
,
I
fed
the
dog
and
then
worked
on
my
Saturday
curriculuum
for
my
students
and
then
had
some
server
work
to
do
.
And
then
my
mom
made
really
good
food
,
but
I
was
already
over
like
my
diet
stuff
,
so
then
after
dinner
,
like
at
around
6
:
30
,
I
went
for
a
5
mile
run
.
I
'
m
really
proud
of
this
one
because
I
actually
ran
it
without
ever
stopping
,
just
ran
and
jogged
the
entire
thing
through
which
was
crazy
.
And
then
I
just
came
back
home
from
that
,
showered
,
and
I
'
m
like
dead
as
all
hell
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
has
been
a
**
day
**
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
im
not
ignoring
,
im
reading
,
give
me
a
min
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
no
worries
no
worries
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhh
damn
,
and
i
thought
my
little
walk
around
the
campus
was
a
lot
.
Good
Job
though
,
proud
of
you
.
5
miles
is
a
lottttttt
.
Glad
the
club
went
well
and
the
fact
that
you
lectured
to
100
students
is
wild
.
You
have
had
a
day
.
Do
you
just
listen
to
music
and
think
about
nothing
when
you
run
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Take
care
though
,
make
sure
you
rest
,
you
know
drink
tea
if
needed

Oh

But

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
slightly
,
might
need
to
review
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
thats
a
first
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
testing
the
waters
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
i
'
m
ngl
,
i
used
khan
academy
like
crazy
when
I
was
going
through
my
calc
classes
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
explain
the
concepts
pretty
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
still
using
that
,
I
taught
myself
a
little
about
limits
and
how
they
work
using
khan
academy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
during
the
summer
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
good
good
!
limits
is
the
first
concept
you
learn
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
from
there
you
'
ll
transition
to
derivatives
,
and
from
there
to
anti
-
derivatives
aka
integrals
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
did
you
feel
about
limits
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
I
got
the
basics
down
,
and
if
he
went
on
from
there
,
i
should
be
able
to
pick
it
up
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
then
you
'
re
golden
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
honestly
if
you
'
re
worried
,
what
you
can
do
is
keep
ahead
in
the
khan
academy
lessons
comparatively
to
his
lessons
,
and
it
'
ll
help
you
call
back
concepts
easier
and
with
a
lot
more
understanding
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wouldn
'
t
say
study
the
entire
course
catalog
in
a
single
day
,
but
be
a
couple
lessons
ahead
so
you
know
what
to
expect
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
omg
i
was
literally
thinking
of
doing
that
,
you
fr
reading
my
thoughts
rn
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood

,
but
like
then
got
like
this
dream
that
spiders
were
everywhere
so
woke
up
in
shock
for
a
min
and
then
checked
everything
,
then
I
woke
up
straight
in
the
morning
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hope
your
sleep
was
peaceful

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

out
here
fighting
your
actual
worst
nightmare
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yep

like
a
rock
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

2
:
30
and
just
like
looking
around
,
I
like
checked
my
blanket
my
walls
and
everything
,
then
after
like
15
min
of
worrying
,
I
randomly
passed
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Thankfully
just
a
dream

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

the
call
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
had
0
energy
left
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

bug
or
spider

I
am

my
dream

time
somehow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Dude
fr
needs
to
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
praying
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
got
it
👍

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👋
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Hi
,
how
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hey
,
it
'
s
been
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nothing
too
interesting
,
math
was
simple
and
he
scared
me
less
today
,
and
I
learned
that
there
has
been
a
Covid
outbreak
in
the
residence
halls
so
that
’
s
why
I
was
sick
the
past
few
days
probably
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhh
yeah
I
guess
that
would
make
sense
,
you
were
coughing
after
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
did
you
guys
do
limits
today
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
just
review
of
pre
-
calc
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
he
said
that
limits
is
actually
going
to
be
after
like
the
midterms
,
today
he
just
went
over
the
importance
of
exponents
and
their
rules
.
he
took
way
too
long
talking
about
the
logistics
of
the
class
that
he
had
only
10
minutes
at
the
end
for
whatever
he
wanted
to
teach
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
fairly
short
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
wow
exponents
?
i
guess
setting
up
for
derivatives
,
but
that
'
s
weird
,
i
'
ve
never
seen
calc
1
be
taught
with
limits
not
being
the
first
topic
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
guess
it
makes
sense
because
connecting
limits
and
derivatives
is
towards
the
end
of
the
semester
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
thats
what
I
thought
too
,
but
he
said
he
wanted
to
get
started
with
pre
calc
stuff
and
then
move
on
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Probably
,
I
am
just
waiting
for
this
one
to
be
over
because
it
is
a
part
of
another
one
that
I
will
have
to
take
next
semester
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
have
another
math
course
after
this
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
is
it
calc
2
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
like
math
16B
,
and
the
one
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

i
would
climb
out
of

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aside
from
your
dog
,

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
laptop
broke
down
,

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
like
when
i
think
about
it
,
my
parents
would
certainly
be
shocked
/
surprised
,
but
they
'
d
warm
up
to
the
idea
eventually
....
probably
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
fs
,
and
then
we

that
i
'
m

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its

reason
i

[prabipyakurel]

d
do
anything
for
a
treat
or
a
bone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

like
dragging
your
phone
downstairs
and

his
paws
to

up
the
call
history
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

his

secret
admirer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
ll
go
on
google
images
and
search
up
treats
and
stare
at
it
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
He
seems
like
a
chill
dude
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
love
it
when
he
barely
wakes
up
,
that
'
s
when
he
'
s
the
sweetest
and
wants
to
be
around
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
once
someone
disturbs
the
peace
,
its
over
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
'
s
bouncing
off
the
walls
at
that
point
and
there

the
first
time
I
saw
you
at
your
house
,
everytime
after
that
,
if
I
saw
you
anywhere
,
I

just
be
doing
anything
to
like
get
a
chance
to
talk
to
you
or
stay
a
bit
longer
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
me
too
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
still

about
the
last
time
i

you
,
if

i
didn
'
t
have
to
go
so
early
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
i
am
replaying
that
in
my
head
wishing
I
had
said
something
other
than
just
bye
at
the
door
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
you

what
kind
of
ticked
me

when
i

went
to
go
pickup
the
person
,
they
got
stuck
in
traffic
for
40
mins
more
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
could
'
ve
just
stayed
instead
of

so
earlyyyyyyyyyyy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhhhhh

that
40
min
with

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lovely
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
my
brother
was
there
asking
the
dumbest
questions
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
wanted
to
show
you
the
things
I
enjoy
in
hopes
it
would
create
conversation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
did
,
i
called
that
thing
a
briefcase
before
I
knew
what
it
was
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
I
remember
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
started
a
conversation
,
i
was
so
dumb
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
hey
now
you
know
how
to
use
a
vinyl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
now
i
understand
why
when
your
sister
and
alish
were
going
to
mc
donalds
,
you
stayed
behind
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
thought
you
would
have
gone
with
them
,
i
was
ready
to
go
sit
with
aunties
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
really
wanted
to
have
a
chance
to
just
talk
to
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
when
we
were
playing
card
games
and
you
joined
in
,
and
then
they
said
they
wanted
to
get
food
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
really
didn
'
t
,
i
thought
i
'
d
miss
my
chance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
was
another
one
of
those
nights
to
remember
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
we
talked
a
little
bit
outside
before
i
left
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
when
you
know
a
bunch
of
boys
were
singing
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
remember
like
it
was
yesterday
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
watching
them
from
the
outside
with
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
slept
with
a
smile
on
my
face
i
swear
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
left
smiling
and
continued
smiling
on
my
way
home
to
bed
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
you
dropped
like
a
knife
or
something
and
broke
it
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
that
was
quite
funny
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg

cake
knife
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
panicking
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
looked
at
your
mom
and
went
"
it
broke
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
know
how
to
keep
a
calm
face
but
be
freaking
out
inside
pretty
well
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
but
like
I
remember
every
interaction
I
have
had
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
there
was
always
something
about
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
from
then
I
would
always
be
like
,
just
imagine
if
we
ever
started
talking
and
came
this
far
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
my
wishing
are
coming
true
little
by
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
same
wtf
we
'
re
the
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
everytime
i
heard
you
were
gonna
attend
some
event
or
something
,
i
made
sure
i
could
go
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
my
parents
were
surprised
to
see
me
be
so
eager
at
times
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
trust
me
,
i
would
not
know
if
you
were
attending
but
if
your
parents
were
,
there
was
a
chance
,
so
i
would
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
and
for
the
record
,
my
parents
would
talk
about
you
a
lot
when
we
used
to
meet
somewhat
more
regularly
,
and
i
'
d
just
have
to
pretend
that
it
was
nothing
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
couldn
'
t
let
it
show
yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
,
when
you
left
from
my
house
both
times
,
my
mom
would
start
the
convo
and
be
like
,
he
is
so
sweet
and
caring
and
nice
,
and
my
dad
would
nod
his
head
.
That
was
a
pretty
good
sign
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
brother
would
give
me
those
eyebrows
looks
and
I
would
just
pretend
that
that
i
totally
didnt
have
a
crush
on
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
your
brother
is
hilarious
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
honestly
such
a
funny
dude
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
one
fr
be
saying
the
wrong
things
at
the
wrong
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
then
seeing
you
be
mad
at
him
it
just
made
me
smile
everytime
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
,
funny
is
not
the
only
word
used
to
describe
him
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
way
you
'
d
snap
at
him
if
he
even
breathed
the
wrong
way
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
thats
because
when
we
were
playing
card
in
your
sisters
room
,
everyone
would
be
sitting
normally
and
he
be
laying
down
and
saying
the
weirdest
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
in
front
of
you
,
oh
if
looks
could
kill
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
honestly
very
wholesome
when
I
saw
you
and
your
brother
interact
with
each
other
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
could
just
tell
how
much
you
care
about
him
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
jokes
aside
I
love
him
and
want
to
see
him
be
anything
he
desires
to
be

how
to

people
down

i
remember
when
I
got
waitlisted
from
UCLA
,
I
called
her
and
she
made
me
feel
okay
and
I
stopped
stressing
.
I
would
have
panicked
and
done
something
if
she
didnt
say
some
of
those
uplifting
things
to
me
.
She
is
amazing
and
the
prettiest
person

and
if
that
'
s
not
convincing
enough
to
everyone
else
,

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
i
know
for
a
fact
my
famliy

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I

with
you
upstairs
in
my
room
when
we
were
playing
battleship
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
probably
why
he
was
teasing
you
about
speaking
nepali
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
makes
sense
now
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
he
kept
giving
you
that

[sskarz]
he
'
s
so
interested
in
relationships
or

he
got
my
phone
for
a
second
,
he

d
search

the
time
we
came
to
your
house
,
he
kept
on
passing
by
and
going
"
thats
right
"
or
"
i
taught
him
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
it
was
just
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
your
face
was
like
nah
uh
,
you
didnt
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
he
'
s
basically
my
older
brother
,
he
lived
with
me
for
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
some
stuff
,
i
won
'
t
lie
,
he
did
teach
me
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
hey
i
learned
that
stuff
on
my
own
,
that
was
true
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
and
thats
good
to
have
him
around
sometimes
you
know
,
he
will
just
keep
putting
you
in
awkward
situations
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
he
'
ll
keep
me
in
check
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
at
the
party
saturday
,
I
doubt
anyone
will
really
focus
on
you
and
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
my
parents
,
havent
seen
them
in
a
while
,
but
other
than
that
,
i
think
we
got
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
find
a
way
to
hug
you
without
anyone
seeing
us
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
on
my
bucket
list
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

t
I

away
from
each
other

and
I
hope
that
this
long
distance
thing
works
for
us
.
I
know
its
a
little
hard
and
you
might
not
want
it
to
be
this
way
but
let
me
know
if
you
ever
feel
like
its
a
little
difficult
.
But
no

how
far
we
are

of
my
room

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

communal
room
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

on
every
floor
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

d

of
the
dorm
experience

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
you

[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

talk
to
you

'
t
talked
since

somewhat
strangers

dont
like
each
other
and
talk
to
each
other
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Imagine
sitting
across
the
table
like
how
we
sat
at
that
one
party
and
screaming
,
so
how
has
life
been
?

i
remember
that
party
where
we
sat
across
from
each
other
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
remember
so
specifically
that
i
kept
sneaking
glances
at
you
,
and
then
i
saw
you
do
the
same
and
i
was
like
woah

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
wanted
to
sit
next
to
you
but
the
table
was
full
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

,
i
wanted
to
tell
bijesh
to
get
the
hell
out
of
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
sit
somewhere
else
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
poor
bijesh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
nothing
against
the
dude
,
but
I
was
like
,
just
if
that
place
was
empty
,
I
would
like
spill
a
drink
in
that
area
so
I
could
go
sit
over
there
.
[prabipyakurel]

to
bijesh
so

💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

talking
to
everyone
else
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

no
,
I
thought
I
saw
you
seeing
me
give
you
glances
,
and
I
was
scared
of
appearing
like
I
was
creeping
you
out
or
something
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
literally
tick
all
of
my
boxes
in
what
I
want
for
a
partner
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
every
single
one
of
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

how
to
hide
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

to
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
don
'
t
mind
sharing
at
all
,
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
honestly
kind
of
complicated
without
knowing
how
it
started
in
the
first
place
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
to
shorten
things
down
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
essentially
,
she
cheated
on
me
,
and
obviously
when
someone
cheats
on
you
,
you
feel
like
the
worst
,
so
I
ended
things
with
her
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
geez
,
im
so
sorry
,
yea
no
its
good
that
you
ended
it
off
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
She
didnt
deserve
you
,
thats
cruel
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
it
was
a
very
...
interesting
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
have
to
tell
you
the
whole
story
another
time
though
,
it
'
s
honestly
wild
how
that
all
happened
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
another
time
for
sure
,
i
would
love
to
hear
how
this
bitch
had
the
audacity
to
cheat
on
someone
like
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry

the
language
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

no
no
need
to
hide
the
language
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i

hiding
my
language
too
in
case
you
were
like
super
against
cursing
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Was
she
nepali

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
doomed
from
the
start
,
but
yk
,
i
wasn
'
t
exactly
the
smartest
back
then
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
but
its
okay
,
life
builds
us
and
sometimes
god
doesnt
let
things
work
out
and
settle
down
for
a
reason
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
no
im
glad
i
learned
from
that
experience
,
but
i
don
'
t
miss
it
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
a
life
lesson
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
glad
you
ended
it
when
you
did
,
that
sucks
,
from
what
I
saw
happen
to
my
friend
this
years
,
i
hate
cheaters
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
because
people
cheat
,
that
is
why
sometimes
it
takes
me
a
while
to
fully
like
a
guy
you
know
,
like
some
of
them
are
nice
and
all
and
they
have
done
many
bad
things
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
totally
get
that
,
you
have
to
protect
yourself
from
them
yk

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

You
are
just
being
you
and
went
though
things
that
you
didn

t
deserve
at
all

things
are
getting
better
for
you

How
about

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
I
'
m
ngl
I
was
so
tired
after
the
class
,
and
then
hearing
that
I
had
to
carry
stuff
back
and
forth
between
houses
I
was
like
ughh
.
But
I
went
and
did
it
,
and
that
took
like
2
hours
.
So
afterwards
,
I
was
like
,
I
already
did
so
much
lifting
,
so
I
might
as
well
just
go
straight
into
a
workout
.
Drove
from
my
cousin
'
s
house
,
to
my
house
,
got
some
caffeine
and
then
went
to
the
gym
.
So
here
'
s
the
crazy
part
:
I
met
Bijesh
and
the
whole
gang
there
and
they
were
working
out
too
.
As
well
as
one
CSULA
student
that
recognized
me
from
doing
the
presentations
in
multiple
of
their
classes
lol
.
That
was
pretty
cool
,
and
then
I
got
like
a
2
hour
workout
in
.
Absolutely
exhausted
myself
,
came
back
home
,
showered
and
drank
tons
of
water
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
you
are
just
too
cute
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

were
like
busy
busy
.
You
must
be
tired
after
all
that
,
see
so
many
people
recognize
you
,
you
are
already
starting
to
be
famous
.
Make
sure
to
rest
a
lot
and
drink
water
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
was
the
workout
,
was
it
like
a
short
and
quick
one
or
like
did
you
do
extra
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

I
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
went
extra
hard
today
,
really
just
wanted
to
exhaust
all
my
energy
out
so
I
could
come
home
nice
and
relaxed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
,
my
lunch
was
some
restaurant
food
,
and
it
was
full
of
carbs
so
I
needed
to
burn
that
off
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
mhmmm
you
really
are
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
but
sometimes
its
okay
to
just
eat
outside
food
and
fall
asleep
,
i
be
doing
nothing
after
eating
lol
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
literally
burning
everything
I
eat
just
walking
around
campus
and
up
and
down
the
stairs
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
your
campus
is
huge
,
that
cardio
comes
naturally
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
sometimes
,
dont
exhaust
yourself
all
the
way
either
,
take
care
of
your
health
too
.

,
im
just
like
so
out
of
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
this
album
i
'
m
listening
to
is
putting
me
in
a
trance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
so
nice
its
like
my
brain
feels
so
relaxed
it
'
s
forgetting
to
think
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
should
feel
relaxed
,
and
the
playlist
is
pretty
calm
and
smooth
,
lol
I
was
blasting
mexican
music
in
my
ear
like
before
I
was
texting
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
comparing
this
to
what
i
listen
to
in
the
gym
couldn
'
t
be
more
opposite
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
fr
might
go
deaf
for
how
loud
i
put
the
music
in
my
ears
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
probably
listen
to
some
motivating
music
at
the
gym
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yup
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
I
do
that
and
have
to
take
them
out
to
see
if
I
can
still
hear
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
might
need
to
do
one
of
those
hearing
tests
they
do
in
like
those
hospital
checkups
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
where
you
raise
your
hand
depending
on
where
you
hear
the
pitch
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
like
actually
,
I
got
that
done
and
they
told
me
I
need
to
go
check
it
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
hearing
has
definitely
gotten
worse
over
the
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
probably
like
ear
wax
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
i
clean
that
stuff
out
regularly
,
i
doubt
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
for
sure
,
at
this
point
when
I
tell
people
to
repeat
and
I
dont
hear
on
the
3rd
try
,
I
just
nod
and
agree
with
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

re

lower
than
usual
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

in

make
sure
you

some
sleep
in

[prabipyakurel]
True

a
wave

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

idk
might
raise
some

,
espcially
to
my
nosy
cousin
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh

be
watching
everything
closely
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

caught
me
today
,
i
was
teaching
and
he
came
up
to
me
,
and

was
unlocked
and

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
on
the
conversation
with
me
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
i
had
just
finished
responding
to
you
and
he
came
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
,
keep
him
away
,
the
last
thing
i
need
is
someone
accidently
getting
their
hands
on
our
conversation
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
might
need
to
invest
into
a
privacy
screen
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Your
heart
probably
did
that
"
oh
shit
"
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
then
again
,
that
'
s
probably
raising
more
suspicions
then
protecting
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
parents
are
gonna
be
like
,
why
did
you
suddenly
decide
to
put
that
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeahhh
i
just
froze
and
smoothly
just
flipped
my
phone
over
while
we
talked
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
then
its
over
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
know
my
parents
are
hilarious
,
they
used
to
pretend
i
had
a
girlfriend
before
and
i
always
just
told
them
fake
stories
about
a
fake
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
parents
will
ask
you
sus
questions
in
such
a
way
,
that
you
will
give
it
up
somehow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
'
d
have
no
idea
if
they
asked
me
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
but
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
real
detectives
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
they
will
just
think
you
are
talking
about
a
fake
person
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
they
'
d
have
no
idea
what
developments
have
happened
since
the
last
time
they
joked
with
me
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
something
i
thought
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
they
probably
wont
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
trust
me
,
our
secret
stays
with
us
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
not
going
to
hint
at
anything
at
all
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
until
we
'
re
both
confident
with
us
being
known
with
our
families
and
everyone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
have
my
absolute
word
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
me
neither
,
yea
we
will
get
older
,
and
be
successful
,
then
when
we
are
both
able
to
,
confront
them
somehow
,
I
dont
know
how
the
hell
,
but
someway
that
doesnt
involve
getting
a
lecture
back
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
the
lecture
is
inevitable
haha
,
but
we
can
worry
about
that
later

form
your
own
corner
in
my
heart
and
it
grows
by
the
coming
days

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
no
idea
if
you
were
interested
in
me
at
all
,
or
you
were
just
reciprocating
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
was
interested
in
you
the
day
I
saw
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you

,
I
fr
just
thought
you
saw
me
as
a
college
freshmen
that
just
talked
a
lot
,
and
would
always
think
,
is
he
interested
in
me
,
or
is
he
just
being
him
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

:)

You

things
you
said
to
me
before
you
told
me
you
likes
me
,
I
am
ngl
,
I
used
to
search
up
like
"
what
does
it
mean
when
a
boy
says
this
or
that
"
and
looking
back
at
our
conversation
,
it
seems
really
obvious
now
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

No

,
I
searched
up
everything
you
said
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
kept
every
word
in
my
mind
and
would
go
back
and
read
it
over
and
over
to
figure
it
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
was
too
scared
to
ask
you
if
you
felt
that
way
.

[sskarz]

no
debate
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
have
liked
you
for
like
2
years
and
you
probably
didnt
even
know
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
had
no
clue
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
there
is
a
reasonable
debate
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
exactly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
its
me
first
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
know
I
'
m
dumb
as
rocks
to
take
any
sort
of
hint
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
still
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
love
you
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
idk
if
i
ever
gave
you
hints
,
i
always
though
you
would
find
it
weird
but
i
tried
my
best
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
you
were
elusive
,
too
small
of
hints
to
tell
if
you
were
just
being
nice
or
you
liked
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
thought
if
I
gave
away
too
much
,
you
would
slowly
disconnect
from
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
would
never
,
my
heart
always
raced
and
beat
so
fast
when
I
talked
to
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
would
have
discord
open
so
I
would
never
miss
your
message
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
,
just
finished
the
playlist
,
it
was
awesome
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
an
album
but
yk

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
literally
played
this
in
the
background
talking
to
you
and
I
just
fits
the
mood
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
add
that
to
the
date
playlist
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
incredibly
relaxed
right
now
,
and
I
’
m
laying
down
in
bed
texting
you
with
this
music
,
I
couldn
’
t
ask
for
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
like
I
’
m
gonna
sink
into
my
bed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
need
this
on
vinyl
,
I
’
ve
decided
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
always
relaxing
talking
to
you
too
,
about
literally
anything
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
calms
me
down
and
gets
me
ready
for
the
next
day
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
make
me
so
happy
you
don
’
t
even
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
should
have
asked
for
your
discord
the
time
time
I
met
you
,
i
had
barely
gotten
discord
and
I
was
going
and
asking
everyone
like
crazy
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
i
missed
you
,
the
one
person
I
should
have
gotten
it
from
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
wanted
to
ask
for
your
number
,
but
I
thought
it
was
too
soon
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
then
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
the
first
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
No
lie
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
unsure
still
because
I
hadn
’
t
felt
like
that
before
,
but
I
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
if
I
gave
it
a
chance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
trust
me
when
I
say
this
,
I
am
not
a
big
fan
of
giving
my
number
out
and
will
avoid
the
question
,
but
that
night
I
saw
you
and
I
was
like
,
okay
if
he
asks
,
you
give
it
to
him
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
then
I
got
scared
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
completely
fair
,
I
’
m
kinda
glad
I
waited
till
I
confessed
my
love
for
you
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
to
be
sure
yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
so
scared
,
you
and
my
brother
and
the
kid
went
upstairs
,
and
I
came
in
after
,
I
thought
you
were
gonna
find
me
so
weird
and
all
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Noooo
I
was
interested
in
talking
with
you
the
most
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
the
love
was
already
there
,
we
both
were
just
doubting
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
you
gave
me
shy
girl
vibes
so
I
didn
’
t
want
to
force
any
conversation
that
would
lead
to
my
demise
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
rode
the
wave
for
what
you
were
comfortable
with
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
sweet
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
#
1
goal
with
meeting
new
people
and
getting
to
know
them
is
having
them
be
comfortable
around
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally
I
saw
you
after
your
dad
called
and
introduced
you
and
i
was
like
just
staring
at
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
u
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
for
sure
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
that
was
so
uncomfortable
when
my
dad
was
introducing
me
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
like
dad
stoppppp
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
’
re
turning
her
awayyyy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
he
wasnt
,
because
he
came
to
ours
for
the
previous
meeting
and
he
was
talking
about
how
you
went
to
mark
keppel
and
then
he
moved
you
and
stuff
,
and
I
was
so
excited
to
meet
you
that
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
I
did
,
and
it
was
just
amazing
,
I
followed
your
mom
when
she
was
giving
the
house
tour
to
the
other
people
and
I
was
like
"
great
chance
to
go
up
and
introduce
myself
to
him
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
are
so
god
damn
adorable
ugh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
make
my
heart
ache
in
the
best
way
possible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
My
heart
warms
up
so
much
when
I
even
read
your
messages
,
and
then
i
just
freeze
and
I
love
that
feeling
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
there
was
this
other
time
when
there
was
some
sort
of
event
at
your
house
,
but
only
my
parents
went
because
I
think
we
had
someone
over
and
I
think
your
dad
had
told
you
that
we
were
coming
,
and
my
dad
was
like
sanskar
came
down
to
meet
you
,
we
should
have
taken
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
seriously
,
like
I
was
begging
for
them
to
take
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OMG
yeah
I
wanted
to
see
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
kinda
sad
when
I
couldn
’
t
see
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
like
damn
,
did
I
say
something
or
do
something
to
make
her
avoid
me
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
classic
doubting
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
no
never
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
my
mom
was
like
,
he
came
running
but
didnt
get
to
meet
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
,
"
yuh
because
you
didnt
take
me
when
I
wanted
to
go
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
had
no
idea
,
I
heard
your
parents
were
coming
over
and
I
made
sure
to
look
and
be
my
best
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wanted
to
make
better
impressions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You

need
to
try
looking
the
best
,
you
were
already
so
cute
and
perfect
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

Like
when
I
used
to
go
to
alish
dada
'
s
house
for
the
teej
programs
and
stuff
,
I
would
take
a
little
walk
around
their
house
just
to
see
if
I
could
get
like
a
small
glimpse
of
you
from
anywhere
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

And

to
keep
it
as
a
vivid
memory
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
your
parents
came
in
and
my

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But

in
the
back
of
my
mind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
never
felt
this
way
with
anyone
,
it
was
an
amazing
feeling
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Me
neither
,
this
is
unlike
anything
I
’
ve
ever
felt
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
I
’
ve
never
felt
so
connected
with
someone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Even
just
texting
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
just
that
conversation
on
fourth
of
july
set
this
thing
off
and
I
was
so
amazed
by
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
know
you
’
re
out
there
,
striving
to
be
your
best
,
and
that
makes
me
love
you
so
much
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
so
so
so
so
so
glad
I
sent
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
really
close
to
just
saying
,
ah
that
’
s
stupid
I
shouldn
’
t
just
say
this
out
of
nowhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
something
just
felt
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
it
was
meant
to
be
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
,
I
am
starting
to
think
it
was
just
destined
from
the
beginning
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
I
was
just
ugly
,
turns
out
god
had
better
and
probably
the
best
plan
for
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
god
you
’
re
beautiful
,
don
’
t
think
any
thing
else
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
’
re
so
pretty
like
really
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
stunned
every
time
I
see
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
that
’
s
the
truth
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
know
I
’
m
honest
to
everything
I
say
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
LOVE
YOU
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

you
more
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
feel
right
at
home
with
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
the
4th
of
july
you
texted
me
,
we
had
people
over
too
,
you
dont
know
how
fast
I
cleaned
everything
up
and
told
everyone
to
forget
about
looking
outside
at
fireworks
and
go
to
bed
so
I
can
go
to
my
bed
,
turn
off
the
lights
and
have
a
conversation
with
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
didn
'
t
brush
that
night
,
i
literally
jumped
into
my
PJs
and
was
like
,
nope
dont
got
that
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
like
my
home
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
just
a
part
of
me
now
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
will
forever
be
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahahaha
the
way
I
forgot
it
was
the
4th
of
July
when
our
conversation
kept
going
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Actually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
you
’
re
a
part
of
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
in
the
beginning
I
was
so
happy
when
I
got
my
message
from
you
,
and
my
brother
was
like
"
yea
I
am
currently
taking
to
sanskar
dada
right
now
,
and
i
was
like
oh
I
guess
he
was
just
sending
it
to
both
siblings
then
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
now
when
you
tell
me
that
you
wanted
it
to
start
a
conversation
and
as
to
why
you
sent
it
to
the
both
if
us
,
it
is
the
most
sweetest
thing
ever
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Those
fireworks
were
for
us
,
it
was
not
for
the
fourth
of
july
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
was
my
cover
up
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg
my
sister
and
my
uncle
just
barged
into
my
room
just
now
and
I
flipped
my
phone
under
my
covers
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
can
’
t
keep
doing
this
to
me
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
really
was
,
I
’
d
love
the
chance
to
see
the
fireworks
with
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
’
ll
feel
like
it
all
came
full
circle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Great

my
parents

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hmmm

,
so
yk
I
don
’
t
have
to
distance
myself
from
you
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Did

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
Trust

in
your
arms
with
a
blanket
and
food
just
looking
up
at
the
sky

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We

[prabipyakurel]
Me

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
got
many
things
to
do
,
and
as
I
get
used
to
like
college
and
stuff
,
after
some
time
I
should
be
able
to
tell
my
parents
like
I
am
going
with
a
few
friends
of
mine
,
and
they
wont
mind
.
Other
times
I
will
sneak
out
to
see
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha

backup
plan

I
don
’
t
wanna
do
anything
that
’
s
gonna
jeopardize
us
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I

have
a
coverup
story
ready
,
if
anything
a
homeless
man
chased
me
to
the
park
and
I

came
running
back
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

came
in
just
to
mess
with
me
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
They
also
needed
a
blanket
,
but
damn

came
in
with
guns
blazing
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
trust
me
they
don
’
t
know
anything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
good
at
hiding
things
physically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
we
are
not
doing
anything
illegal
,
its
just
when
you
have
strict
parents
and
a
strict
household
in
general
,
everytime
I
am
talking
to
you
and
they
barge
in
,
I
got
to
act
like
I
am
hiding
drugs
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
get
used
to
flipping
that
phone
over
under
the
sheets
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hey
both
of
our
parents

the
idea
of
us
together

to
that
situation
,
I

m
fighting
for
us
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Been

life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Meh

fine
with
us
,
I
am
not
even
worrying
about
that
part
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Aside
from
your
dog
,
who
is
still
scary
as
of
now
,
everyone
is
lovely
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
so
determined
to
be
with
you
,
I
will
fight
everyone
that
dares
to
question
my
feelings
with
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
’
ll
come
to
love
him
too
,
maybe
not
yet
but
eventually
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
’
s
an
even
bigger
sweetheart
than
I
am
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
,
I
am
fighting
with
anyone
that
tries
to
destroy
anything
between
us
or
says
something
about
the
both
of
us
,
they
can
go
to
hell
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
,
yea
that
time
will
come
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
When
you
find
out
how
fluffy
he
is
,
it
’
ll
be
instant
love
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
when
I
am
comfortable
with
the
dog
,
he
is
mine
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
being
the
better
one
,
I
will
tell
him
not
to
eat
bees
instead
of
continuously
asking
him
"
you
like
bees
bear
"
"
yea
you
like
bees
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
I
saw
him
hunting
more
bees
the
other
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
’
s
really
a
menace
out
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
poor
bees
fearing
for
their
lives
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
gonna
stop
coming
over
to
yours
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
don
’
t
exactly
have
the
best
history
with
bees
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Back
in
my
old
house
,
there
was
this
huge
hive
right
outside
my
garage
and
every
time
I
left
the
house
,
I
had
to
run
past
the
active
hive
just
so
I
wouldn
’
t
piss
off
any
hornet
that
was
bored
and
wanted
to
sting
someone
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
They
fr
traumatized
me
with
how
they
chased
me
sometimes
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
ever
get
bitten
though
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Surprisingly
I
have
no
memory
of
being
stung
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
probably
went
out
to
sting
those
that
deserved
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
still
a
little
scared
of
them
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
I
see
one
near
me
I
’
m
running
at
least
half
a
mile
before
I
check
over
my
shoulder
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
one
of
the
few
insects
that
actually
scare
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
got
you
,
if
there
is
a
bee
or
a
wasp
,
I
will
get
it
away
from
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
you
’
re
really
perfect
,
my
savior
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
gotchu
from
spiders
you
don
’
t
even
need
to
worry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
,
like
when
I
go
out
to
water
my
flowers
back
home
,
the
bees
be
chillin
flying
doing
their
thing
and
if
they
come
near
me
,
the
most
I
would
do
is
shut
the
front
door
so
they
wont
get
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
just
wave
my
hands
slightly
and
they
will
move
on
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don
'
t
worry
,
nothing
is
harming
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
See
I
did
that
one
time
as
a
kid
,
and
me
being
unlucky
,
I
pissed
off
a
wasp
and
I
ran
for
my
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
love
you
more
bae
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
there
are
always
wasps
around
my
new
house
,
and
like
multiple
used
to
just
hover
when
I
was
watering
the
plans
,
I
think
there
might
be
a
small
hive
under
one
of
the
bushes
or
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
wasps
are
okay
,
if
you
leave
them
alone
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Now
those
flying
beetles
and
big
cockroaches
,
those
are
a
problem
,
I
will
leave
and
run
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
all
banded
together
,
had
a
bee
meeting
,
and
said
if
they
saw
me
it
’
s
sting
on
sight
I
swear
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah

’
ll
run
away
together
on
that
one
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
you
are
really
sweet
,
so

it
out
,
I
usually
just
cry
in
a
pillow
or
just
like
in
the
restroom
,
the
one
time
i
did
have
a
panic
attack
was
when
I
was
picking
classes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
was
just
a
horrible
day

where
my
eyes
are
like
“

’
s
time
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

the
teacher
isn

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

d
keep
you
awake
at
least
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

wouldn
’
t
,
I
would
just
zone
out

pass
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
in
the
future
,
maybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwwww
but
yes
that
would
be
so
cute
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
am
telling
you
in
high
school
I
slept
through
my
math
and
English
class
and
the
teachers
would
pick
on
everyone
else
but
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
lucky
,
i
always
got
called
on
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
unfair
fr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Aha
loser
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
i
had
a
professor
that
just
loved
picking
on
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
when
i
realized
that
,
i
aced
every
single
question
for
like
a
week
and
he
stopped
picking
on
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
so
annoyed
by
that
guy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
because
you
were
smart
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
why
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nah
i
just
forced
caffeine
before
the
class
so
i
could
stay
awake
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
had
like
the
most
**
monotone
**
voice
ever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
'
s
somewhat
relaxing
,
and
when
nothing
is
happening
,
i
just
dozed
off
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
all
of
the
work
i
could
just
do
outside
of
the
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
attendance
was
mandatory
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
aka
sleep
time
because
i
did
all
the
work
before
class
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
like
imagining
how
you
would
look
dozing
off
and
sleeping
in
class
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
in
high
school
I
had
classes
where
I
went
in
and
was
like
okay
nap
time
,
and
no
one
cared
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like

to
text
me

wake
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
had
to
do
the
same
for
notes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

english
teacher

me

a
couple
others
out
for
turning

an
in

A

me
think
of
you
now
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Before
I
was
like
single
and
alone
and
just
vibes
to
the
rhythm
but
now
I
listen
to
the
same
music
and
you

to
mind
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It

s
a
really
good
feeling

[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OMG
speaking
of
single
and
alone
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
remember
when
I
was
talking
to
you
one
time
,
and
you
said
,
"
oh
yeah
i
'
m
living
my
best
life
being
single
"
and
i
was
like
BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
its
doomed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
right
here
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

’
s
because
I
had
to
wait
if
you
were
the
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
’
t
just
say
I
am
taken
when
I
thought
that
only
I
loved
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
needed
to
be
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha

I
totally
get
it
,
I
just
remember
being
like
nooooooooooooooo
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Would
you
have
liked
it
better
if
I
had
said
“
no
I
am
living
the
best
life
with
my
boyfriend
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
better
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
the
way
i
would
'
ve
just
*
faded
away
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
u
wouldn
'
t
have
seen
me
after
that
day
lmao
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
🫠
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lmao
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
would
have
believed
me
that
someone
like
me
would
have
been
dating
someone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
let
my
family
and
their
suspicions
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
uhhhhhhh
who
wouldn
'
t
want
to
be
dating
you
first
of
all
lady
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
had
to
snatch
you
before
anyone
else
could
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
reminded
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
there
is
this
one
dude
that
likes
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
From
sg
,
goes
to
ucla
and
the
way
he
talks
sometimes
is
like
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
makes
me
question
things
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ooooooooooooooooh
dramaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
jk
jk
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
he
uses
🥰
emoji
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
hmmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
to
think
about
that
last
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
yeah
unless
he
'
s
like
,
swinging
the
other
way
in
terms
of
sexuality
,
i
think
ur
right
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
dw
you
did
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
and
I
think
if
you
look
at
my
recent
insta
post
,
under
the
name
avocado
or
something
,
he
reacted
with
those
emojis
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
fr
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
he
might
be
gay
tho
,
i
know
some
gay
friends
and
they
use
that
emoji
around
their
friends
that
are
girls
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
idk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
he
is
not
gay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
gay
friends
and
they
do
not
talk
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhh
then
maybe
he
does
have
a
crush
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
know
that
also
reminds
me
of
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
when
we
used
to
talk
like
in
the
early
stage
,
we
talked
one
time
on
instagram
,
and
when
i
said
bye
to
you
after
talking
to
you
,
you
sent
me
like
a
heart
emoji
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
at
the
time
i
was
like
,
wait
am
i
looking
at
this
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
spent
like
20
minutes
staring
at
that
emoji
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
okay
,
let
me
explain
,
I
remember
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
that
when
you
press
on
the
heart
,
more
emojis
pop
up
and
I
was
going
to
use
bye
,
but
then
it
just
sent
and
I
didn
’
t
know
how
to
unsend
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAOOOOOOOOOO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
fr
thought
you
would
have
stopped
talking
to
me
after
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
i
was
like
,
WOAH
this
is
my
chance
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
but
that
heart
went
out
to
you
and
I
was
happy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
like
calculating
about
how
i
should
respond
back
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
then
i
was
like
,
nah
i
just
gotta
send
it
back
,
take
the
risk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
one
of
the
scariest
moments
i
swear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
God
you
don
’
t
even
know
,
I
sent
that
and
I
was
like
“
shit
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
had
a
feeling
it
was
a
mistake
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
couldn
'
t
pass
up
the
opportunity
in
case
it
was
intentional
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
the
entire
heart
reacting
started
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
paid
attention
to
every
detail
i
swear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
I
wish
you
could
see
the
way
you
talked
to
me
and
how
I
felt
through
my
shoes
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
in
love
with
everything
you
said
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
like

kept
every

it
made
sense
when
I
met
you
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Because
before
I
saw
you
and
someone
said
that
I
would
be
like
“
what
love
,
who
love
,
where
love
,
HOW
love
?”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
but
fr
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
finding
love
right
now
was
like
nowhere
near
part
of
my
primary
goals
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
hey
,
its
the
best
thing
so
im
so
glad
this
happened
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
just
ticked
off
my
bucket
list
item
:
find
your
someone
that
loves
and
understands
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
They
way
this
happened
and
when
it
did
happen
,
I
am
telling
you
I
wanted
to
just
scream
it
out
my
window
and
say
your
name
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
My
bucket
list
just
said
”
find
the
one
”
and
I
did
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
you
'
ve
got
no
idea
,
i
was
in
a
call
with
my
friends
and
i
wanted
to
just
scream
into
my
mic
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
'
re
one
step
closer
to
completing
our
lists
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
When
you
were
telling
me
you
liked
me
,
you
were
on
a
call
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeahhhhh
i
just
had
them
on
for
white
noise
and
i
wasn
'
t
expecting
all
of
that
to
happen
that
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
literally
left
the
call
the
second
it
started
getting
serious
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
to
like
focus
up
and
think
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwww
lol
could
have
just
let
them
hear
you
panicking
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
mean
i
was
just
silent
,
and
then
i
left
so
they
have
no
clue
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
,
like
you
sent
me
the
riddle
and
when
I
said
I
had
an
idea
,
you
went
,”
now
I
am
scared
you
might
know
the
answer
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
YEAHHHHHHH
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
literally
that
point
i
was
like
,
wait
hold
on
what
is
going
onnnnnnnnnn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
you
send
ME
the
riddle
and
you
started
freaking
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
like
dying
mentally
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
no
because
i
couldn
'
t
tell
if
you
were
disappointed
or
like
happy
with
whatever
you
thought
it
was
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
was
like
wait
this
was
a
mistake
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
like
whyyyyyy
didn
'
t
i
just
say
i
liked
her
,
why
am
i
such
a
dumbass
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
was
not
,
I
didn
’
t
even
think
about
battle
ship
,
I
just
translated
the
last
sentence
and
understood
within
5
min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
not
one
,
tho
I
will
let
you
know
at
times
if
you
act
like
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
after
I
had
a
guess
it
was
me
,
you
know
from
how
you
talk
to
me
everyday
and
stuff
,
I
just
had
to
be
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
true
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
doubted
myself
a
lot
about
how
you
felt
about
me
so
that
'
s
why
i
was
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
edging
the
answer
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
are
the
worst
at
giving
hints
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Let
me
just
put
that
out
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
seriously
copied
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
intentioally
made
them
like
it
made
no
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
well
yeah
you
weren
'
t
giving
any
useful
information
either
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
said
any
other
letter
in
your
name
,
it
would
have
probably
given
it
away
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
SANSKAR

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
1
omg
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
slept
probably
around
11
:
30
to
12
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
had
to
stare
at
the
ceiling
for
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
know
,
the
daily
routine
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
had
one
of
the
mini
insomniac
nights
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
do
you
also
toss
and
turn
when
you
can
’
t
sleep
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
was
so
tired
,
yet
my
body
was
like
nah
we
can
’
t
sleep
rn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeahhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
that
happens
,
and
it
’
s
really
annoying
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Glad
I
am
not
the
only
one
,
I
like
move
so
much
,
and
change
sleeping
positions
and
all
and
still
can
’
t
fall
asleep
when
I
need
to
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha
yeah
it
just
be
like
that
sometimes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Usually
I
can
sleep
in
a
matter
of
like
5
minutes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
there
are
those
nights
where
it
’
s
really
hard
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Do
you
ever
try
just
shutting
your
eyes
for
a
super
long
time
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
for
like
10
minutes
,
and
if
that
doesn
’
t
work
then
I
just
start
watching
some
boring
YouTube
video
in
hopes
I
fall
asleep
from
that
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
basically
what
I
did
last
night
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
but
yea
take
care
of
yourself
,
um
maybe
try
something
different
with
your
routine
to
help
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Only
happens
once
in
a
while
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
ok
,
also
do
you
sleep
with
the
lights
on
,
like
a
little
night
light
or
do
you
need
it
pitch
black
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
sleep
with
the
lights
off
,
but
I
have
a
small
night
light
that
barely
illuminates
,
but
it
’
s
enough
for
me
to
not
bump
into
anything
if
I
got
up
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
I
see
,
I
need
darkness
,
I
cannot
even
have
like
a
little
bright
light
from
anywhere
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
you
know
sometimes
like
this
random
thing
in
your
room
is
giving
off
like
a
little
dot
of
light
,
no
I
cover
that
thing
all
the
way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
damn
,
what
if
you
’
re
getting
light
from
like
a
window
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
mean
I
can
still
fall
asleep
with
lights
on
,
it
’
s
just
not
as
fast
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Window
is

from
window

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
’
ve
gotta
be
like
dead
tired
to
sleep
with
lights
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
otherwise
it
’
s
difficult
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
sometimes
I
occasionally
wake
up
after
nightmares
and
I
will
just
be
walking
around
my
room
trynna
find
the
light
switch
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
the
only
time
I
actually
kind
of
get
scared
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmmm

Woah
that
’

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Feels
like
I
’
m
back
in
Rome
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
pretty
to
look
at
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
the
way
I
pass
this
building
to
get
to
my
11
:
00
class
from
a
class
that
ends
at
10
:
59
,
it
’

crazy
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
was
gonna
mention
that
the
other
day
,
do
u
just
get
there
late
?
No
way
you
can
get
there
in
1
min
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
Berkeley
time
here
which
is
when
the
class
starts
10
min
later
then
the
said
time
so
students
and
professors
can
get
there
in
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhh
okay
that
is
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
if
the
class
extends
just
2
min
past
10
,
it
’
s
the
worst
walk
over
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
imagine
lol
,
the
campus
is
huge
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
the
time
of
the
week
where
I
drink
the
most
water

Oh
okay
,
that
’
s
sounds
pretty
good
,
and
the
only
reason
I

.
Didn

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

time
and

2
min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Don

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
where
or
when
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
'
s
fair
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
I
played
a
car
game
at
my
cousins
and
he
laughed
at
me
the
entire
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
probably
doesn
’
t
count
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
The
controller
is
so
difficult
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
you
just
don
'
t
have
enough
experience
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
maybe
that
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
idk
it
never
really
caught
my
attention
in
any
way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
probably
not
for
you
then
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
couldn
'
t
say
the
same
for
me

lol
,
i
started
playing
when
i
was
really
young
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

with
some
of
my
buddies
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
it
’
s
okay
to
play
once
in
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Remember
I
played
it
in
front
of
you
when
you
came
over
to
our
old
house
and
you
said
something
about
pumpkin
head
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
With
that
high
voice
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
dw
i
wiped
it
from
my
memory
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
I
still
got
it
in
mine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
ngl
after
you
showed
me
the
YouTube
channel
,
I
went
though
some
and
they
were
hilarious
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
fun
when
i
'
ve
done
everything
else
i
'
ve
needed
to
do
,
otherwise
the
stress
of
the
other
stuff
kills
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
mini
Sanskar
narrating
what
was
happening
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
voice
was
so
damn

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No

that
’
s
completely
normal
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

an
expert
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

11
year

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You

so
adorable
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

not
dumb

2
years

the
Microsoft
certification
thing
,
you
were
not
dumb
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

until
you
realize
i
only
started
learning
a
year
before
i
got
that
cert
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
but
you
were
far
from
dumb
,
maybe
you
saw
yourself
that
way
because
you
have
grown
now
,
but
I
am
sure
your
mind
was
just
as
sharp
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Now
I

hear
your

boy
stories
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I

Were

boy
stories

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
She

needed
my
perspective
on
stuff
as
a
guy
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

There

this
guy
at
her
hospital
and
he

s
a
nurse
that
flirts
with
her
,
but
she
didn
’
t
realize
it
till
I
pointed
stuff
out
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwwwww
omg
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

s
textbook
(
me
who
didn
’
t
know
you
liked
me
even
from
the
most
obvious
shit
in
the
world
)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
is
she
okay
with
you
sharing
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
this
is
our
dynamic
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
We
do
this
all
the
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

adorable
,
you
don
’
t
know
how
to
read
any
hints
I
swear
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
anyways
yeah
that
’
s
basically
how
it
went
,
and
I
was
just
like
in
my
head
,
you
know
if
I
said
this
stuff
to
prabi
,
she
would
know
I
liked
her
right
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
my
,
if
you
let
her
reads
out
previous
texts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
She
would
probably
slap
you
as
to
why
you
didn
’
t
realize
before
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
if
I
said
:
oh
yeah
I
would
’
ve
noticed
you
in
a
crowded
room
,
do
you
think
you
would
’
ve
known
I
liked
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg
we
need
to
just
never
tell
her
ever
about
how
I
confessed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
way
I
would
get
laughed
at
for
the
rest
of
my
life
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
once
we
tell
we
tell
her
all
of
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
at
least
if
you
don
’
t
,
yk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
she
can
laugh
at
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Typical
sibling
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
doomed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
not
,
you
are
fine
,
it
was
the
cutest
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
still
feel
embarrassed
thinking
about
it
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
wouldn
’
t
,
I
’
m
too
tiny
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
LMAO

no
that
’
s
not
what
I
meant
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
hey
,
that
was
one
of
the
best
nights
when
you
explained
the
poem
and
confessed
,
I
loved
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
???
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
mean
like
a
guy
says
that
when
they
think
you
’
re
beautiful
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Not
to
compare
heights
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
do
they
?
Yea
that
’
s
a
pretty
sweet
thing
to
say
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
the
guy
said
that
to
swezna
and
she
was
like
,
is
that
flirting
,
so
I
wondered
if
I
said
that
to
u
,
would
u
think
I
was
flirting
with
u
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
hmmmm
,
maybe
yes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Just
to
see
a
girls
perspective
yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ah
okay
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
’
s
like
maybe
maybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
see
that
’
s
the
thing
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
As
a
guy
,
it
’
s
obvious
because
that
’
s
like
textbook
for
flirting
with
a
girl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
a
girl
wouldn
’
t
be
so
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Pretty
interesting
actually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
you
right
you
right
,
we
’
ll
did
he
say
anything
else
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
he
likes
her
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
In
short
yeah
,
which
all
from
a
guys
perspective
it
looks
like
he
likes
her
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
she
wasn
’
t
so
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
’
s
said
and
done
stuff
and
I
’
m
like
,
yeah
I
wouldn
’
t
do
that
to
any
of
my
friends
that
are
girls
that
I
have
no
attraction
to
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhhh
omg
then
maybe
he
likes
her
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Huh
maybe
we
should
tell
her
about
us
soon
,
just
her
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Definitely
does
,
to
the
point
that
MULTIPLE
coworkers
said
it
out
loud
to
her
face
and
she
wasn
’
t
convinced
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
all
up
to
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
She
should
look
into
it
,
but
like
I
am
no
expert
so
tell
her
to
be
careful
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
does
she
like
the
dude
back
in
anyway
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
think
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
👍
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
well
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
and
she
kinda
got
in
this
hole
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
I
see
,
well
there
are
ways
to
let
boys
down
softly
yk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
bet
that
the
guy
would
confess
or
try
a
move
in
the
next
2
weeks
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Possibly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
glad
I
’
m
not
on
that
end
of
the
stick
🙏
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
maybe
he
is
shy
like
you
and
just
like
to
annoy
them
with
hints
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ah
no
trust
me
you
are
fine
,
I
am
glad
you
aren
’
t
the
one
I
had
to
do
that
to
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Could
be
,
but
let
’
s
be
honest
a
26
year
old
me
would
probably
be
a
little
more
straight
to
the
face
than
rn
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Anyone
else
that
confesses
,
they
will
hear
how
I
let
them
down
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Would
you
rather
live
for
eternity
,
or
would
you
rather
live
for
a
shortened
life
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
ask
a
lot
of
friends
this
question
and
the
answers
are
always
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Short
normal
like
with
the
people
I
love
(
including
you
).
I
feel
like
what
is
the
point
of
eternity
when
all
you
can
find
is
in
front
of
you
.
When
you
have
people
you
love
and
friends
around
you
,
just
a
happy
life
to
the
fullest
is
the
best
.
I
would
not
want
to
live
forever
.
Short
and
sweet
,
especially
now
that
I
have
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
literally
the
exact
same
answer
as
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wouldn
’
t
change
a
thing
,
I
’
d
rather
spend
my
last
days
with
you
then
to
live
eternally
for
nothing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
don
’
t
talk
like
that
,
I
cannot
even
imagine
losing
you
in
anyway
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Eternity
is
nothing
without
people
you
love
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
There
’
s
no
point
of
living
for
eternity
if
for
no
emotions
.
Life
is
about
feeling
emotions
,
and
once
you
take
that
away
,
there
’
s
no
more
reason
to
live
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
won
’
t
ever
lose
me
,
trust
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Exactly
how
I
feel
,
yea
like
people
say
you
only
live
once
for
a
reason
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
also
what
would
you
do
if
you
lived
for
an
eternity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
,
you
probably
experienced
everything
the
universe
has
to
offer
at
some
point
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
If
only
I
lived
forever
or
others
too
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Just
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
nothing
,
I
wouldn
’
t
do
anything
,
I
would
think
about
everything
I
had
and
go
insane
thinking
about
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
this
short
life
is
good
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
With
you
and
family
and
friends
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
agree
,
this
life
is
too
good
to
give
up
when
I
have
an
amazing
girlfriend
and
an
amazing
family
,
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
The
gifts
that
don

t
stop
giving
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Sometimes
I
think
about
how
life
has
been
treating
me
so
well
,
and
like
when
is
karma
going
to
catch
up
and
smack
me
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
think
about
that
too
,
I
know
you
will
always
be
with
me
,
but
with
everything
school
wise
that
have
been
going
well
,
I
feel
like
it
will
all
come
down
and
hit
me
somewhere
to
the
point
where
I
won
’
t
be
able
to
pick
my
self
up
anymore
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
dw
no
karma
will
come
for
you
🙏
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
let
me
know
when
you
feel
down
,
and
I
will
lift
you
back
up
,
no
matter
what
it
takes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
no
bad
karma
for
you
either
,
only
the
good
kind
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
always
let
you
know
first
,
you
always
know
what
to
say
.
You
let
me
know
too
if
anything
is
ever
bothering
you
.
I
will
give
you
a
virtual
hug
and
talk
you
through
it

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
it
was
like
an
info
session
for
the
Berkeley
mock
trial
team
,
but
I
don
’
t
think
I
have
the
mental
power
to
take
on
that
club
now
as
a
freshmen
so
it
will
be
like
a
later
thing
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
the
auditions
are
this
week
and
I
chose
to
come
to
LA
and
see
you
instead
of
staying
here
for
that
audition
.

[sskarz]
what
is
the
berkeley
mock
trial
team
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
where
you
basically
become
attorneys
and
witnesses
and
perform
a
case
given
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
compete
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

to
come
to
LA
?
Now
I
feel
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
the
last
thing
I
wanna

pressure
on
myself
with
everything
else
on

of
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
guess
that
'
s
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
not
at
all
,
the
time
commitment
is
crazy
too
,
I
promise
it
’
s
not
like
that
,
it
is
the
time
commitment
of
a
4
unit
course
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
’
t
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

I

so
basically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
a
class
at
11
am
,
and
i
had
already
done
all
the
assignments
for
that
day
before
the
class
so
i
did
nothing
in
class
.
Then
my
next
class
was
supposed
to
be
at
like
3
,
but
that
got
cancelled
.
So
I
had
to
stay
like
5
hours
doing
nothing
to
my
next
class
,
in
which
we
did
literally
nothing
in
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
it
was
just
like
a
whatever
type
of
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Maybe
you
hung
out
with
friends
tho
during
that
time
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
have
never
been
so
unproductive
expecting
to
be
productive
in
my
life
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
everyone
was
in
class
and
there
was
no
one
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
sat
in
the
library
listening
to
music
and
watching
youtube
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awwwww
lol
I
would
say
you
could
have
talked
to
me
but
I
was
also
in
class
lolz
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
what
time
did
you
come
home
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
a
awkward
feeling
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
haha
,
I
was
tempted
to
but
again
,
I
don
'
t
want
to
hinder
your
studies
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
really
is
,
I
just
waited
for
something
the
entire
day
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
would
never
,
I
know
you
won
’
t
!!!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
did
nothing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
’
s
okay
tho
,
you
gave
yourself
a
free
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
is
a
day
to
clear
your
head
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Think
of
it
like
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
know
I
know
but
I
have
respect
for
you
and
this
is
the
promise
I
hold
for
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
How
can
I
clear
my
head
if
there
was
nothing
there
to
begin
with
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Love
you
for
that
,
same
here
,
I
promise
to
never
get
in
your
way
,
I
will
be
in
your
heart
for
moral
support
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
then
it
was
a
free
day
for
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Think
of
it
as
a
rest
day
after
your
time
at
the
gym
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
You
will
never
get
in
my
way
ever
love
,
but
I
appreciate
you
:)

from
exhaustion
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Literally

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
but
it
’
s

,
don

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
A
day
of
sitting
in
the
library
and
YouTube
isn
’
t
going
to
hurt
you
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
will
probably
make
up
for
that
time
one
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
but
like
I
was
just
bored
out
of
my
mind
and
that
'
s
why
it
felt
like
a
slog
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wish
I
just
went
home
early
and
joined
the
class
on
zoom
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
In
my
last
class
,
I
literally
went
to
the
back
of
the
room
and
put
my
head
down
for
20
mins
,
I
woke
up
and
we
were
still
on
the
same
thing
that
I
had
already
done
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
I
see
,
but
it
’
s
fine
.
You
didn
’
t
expect
it
and
sometimes
life
does
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
,
but
you
had
a
good
nap
I
suppose
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
friend
woke
me
up
and
I
looked
at
the
board
,
nothing
had
changed
,
put
my
head
back
down
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
a
good
friend
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
that
’
s
seems
boring
ngl
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
it
was
pretty
bad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
was
your
math
class
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
a
lot
of
help
during
office
hours
,
spent
35
min
looking
for
the
location
but
who
is
counting
that
,
and
for
the
actual
math
class
I
made
a
friend
,
in

her
insta

communicate

Walking

[prabipyakurel]
And

back
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

The

night

I
didn

t
even
want
to
take
the
shortcut
so
I
came
the
long
way
and

I
was

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

past
8

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh

They

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
UGH

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
most
definitely
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
reals
,
it
usually
is
like
hey
I
’
m
here
,
and
hey
I
am
going
the
next
day
,
but
like
damn
,
this
week
has
gone
so
slow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Honestly
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
At
this
point
,
if
I
have
no
other
opportunity
,
I
’
m
gonna
hug
you
in
front
of
everyone
regardless
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
just
mean
so
much
to
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
if
by
the
time
we
leave
I
don
’
t
get
a
chance
,
I
will
go
up
to
you
and
be
like
,
it
was
so
nice
meeting
you
see
you
soon
and
proceed
with
a
BIG
hug
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
,
let
everyone
stare
and
think
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
the
next
day
would
be
WILD
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
For
you
,
imma
be
out
of
town
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
bet
your
family
would
just
spam
call
you
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Gonna
get
lectured
through
the
phone
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yours
would
probably
just
laugh
it
out
or
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
you
will
look
sus
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
no
they
would
be
absolutely
shocked
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
In
a
good
way
most
likely
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
but
it
’
s
a
hug
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yk
,
maybe
it
’
s
not
so
bad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
my
family
would
take
it
to
lengths
and
get
an
FBI
investigation
up
in
our
relationship
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yikes
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
would
stay
insistent
on
knowing
everything
from
that
point
forward
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
yk
it
’
s
good
it
’
s
just
us
right
now
,
let
’
s
keep
it
that
way
so
we
have
our
own
freedom
with
each
other
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
I
don
’
t
want
anyone
to
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
If
I
am
getting
a
hug
,
I
am
getting
one
that
is
worth
it
.
So
we
will
have
to
do
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
ve
got
a
few
ideas
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Go
on
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Okay
first
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
bring
up
the
idea
of
showing
you
the
car
that
I
’
m
driving
now
,
the
Tesla
,
and
we
make
an
excuse
to
go
outside
and
since
you
were
so
interested
,
you
wanted
to
see
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
okay
okay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Second
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
know
the
layout
of
kreepas
house
somewhat
,
and
I
know
that
the
second
floor
has
a
lot
of
rooms
.
We
could
just
make
an
excuse
to
go
talk
upstairs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
it
is
at
their
house
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
assuming
so
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Shit
unless
it
’
s
not
,
then
that
idea
won
’
t
work
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmm
not
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
This
is
why
I
’
ve
thought
of
several
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Third
idea
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Uh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
pull
you
to
a
room
and
lock
it
,
if
literally
nothing
else
works
for
privacy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
so
the
last
2
ideas
are
not
going
to
work
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Most
likely
not
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ve
got
no
idea
what
the
venue
is
like
either
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
either
at
their
house
or
some
kind
of
dinner
place
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
the
first
idea
has
some
merit
to
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
got
any
ideas
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
brother
called
and
then
mom
called
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha
no
worries
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Also
diamond
bar
,
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
’
ll
pray
the
first
idea
works
then
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
first
idea
might
be
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
I
can
leave
something
like
lip
gloss
or
something
in
my
car
and
while
I
am
getting
that
from
dads
car
,
you
can
come
to
check
on
your
car
or
something
a
little
after
I
get
out
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohh
yeah
that
’
s
also
a
good
one
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Watch
my
dad
be
like
,
why
do
you
need
to
get
more
lip
gloss
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Now
the
thing
is
,
since
it
’
s
a
hall
,
we
would
have
to
be
a
little
more
discrete
since
it
’
s
out
in
the
open
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
fr
,
it
is
open
open
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
can
just
park
in
a
dark
corner
,
no
one
would
see
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
need
to
find
that
parking
first
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
scout
the
place
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
say
go
to
the
little
area
to
the
bathroom
and
hug
but
I
know
there
will
be
so
many
aunties
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
that
’
s
got
lots
of
risks
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
What
if
someone
was
in
line
for
the
bathroom
and
we
both
came
out
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Instant
death
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
omg
I
don
’
t
even
want
to
imagine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Scratch
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Burn
that
actually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hmmmmm
[prabipyakurel]

plan
or

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Did
you
sleep
well
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
slept
pretty
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Wbu
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
after
I
was
done
texting
you
,
it
took
me
a
while
to
fall
asleep
and
my
leg
was
hurting
so
bad
,
I
couldn
’
t
fall
asleep
until
maybe
1
.
But
after
that
was
okay
,
I
just
got
up
in
the
morning
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Why
was
your
leg
hurting
so
badly
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
no
idea
honestly
,
but
it
was
just
my
right
one
and
like
nothing
would
help
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
just
like
started
hurting
for
no
reason
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Maybe
it
was
a
muscle
spasm
or
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
possibly
,
but
it
was
like
kind
of
annoying
because
I
couldn
’
t
stop
moving
me
feet
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Then
I
got
up
and
pressed
it
for
a
little
and
it
slightly
went
away
and
I
think
I
slept
after
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
am
all
good
now
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Okay
that
’
s
good
to
hear
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Try
not
to
put
too
much
stress
on
that
leg
for
today
and
see
how
you
feel
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
hey
do
you
remember
a
while
back
when
you
went
to
the
gym
at
like
10
:
00
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
when
you
hadnt
confessed
yet
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
sent
me
a
picture
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
remember
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
so
after
a
little
while
,
you
said
"
can
I
ask
why
you
dont
want
to
hang
out
",
were
you
mad
at
during
that
time
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
has
just
always
been
in
my
mind
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
I
wasn
’
t
mad
,
I
was
honestly
just
confused
.
It
was
during
a
time
I
felt
the
most
confused
with
how
you
felt
about
me
and
I
just
wanted
to
know
why
you
were
feeling
that
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
after
that
conversation
,
I
took
a
step
back
and
reflected
upon
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
,
yea
you
were
like
"
come
to
the
gym
I
will
show
you
everyhting
you
need
to
know
"
and
I
was
like
omg
damn
.
And
then
you
said
that
and
I
was
like
"
oh
no
,
what
if
he
is
like
mad
at
me
or
something
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
,
it
’
s
just
at
the
time
I
was
thinking
back
to
when
you
didn
’
t
want
to
hangout
initially
is
when
it
was
bogging
my
mind
down
.
And
I
just
needed
to
know
why
is
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Trust
me
I
don
’
t
get
mad
easily
haha
,
I
ask
honest
questions
and
then
I
’
ll
decide
if
it
’
s
right
to
be
mad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Gotcha
,
no
no
you
it
was
right
for
you
to
ask
me
lol
,
everyime
someone
asks
to
like
go
here
or
lets
go
there
,
I
am
always
like
,
"
yea
in
the
future
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
love
you
for
that
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
,
couldnt
tell
you
that
night
,
but
you
looked
cute

that
picture

answer
so
I
’
ve
always
just
stepped
back
and
kind

backed
off
just
to
analyze
the
situation
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Awwww

you

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

I
was
scared
that
you
were
going
to
ask
me
to
go
somewhere
and
I
would
have
to
turn
you
down
because
my
parents
will
not
be
okay
,
especially
that
time
when
I
didnt
know
you
liked
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
I
realized
what
I
was
asking
for
wasn

t
realistic
so
I

it
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

you

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
adorable
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
...
you
just
gonna
let
it
sit
there
half
done
if
no
one
is
going
to
attempt
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
TECHNICALLY
it
is
done
…
just
not
correctly
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
then
its
not
done
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mmmm
but
I
could
make
the
argument
that
it
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
until
someone
sits
on
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
then
its
back
to
many
parts
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
the
thing
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
won
’
t
collapse
initially
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
overtime
it
will
eventually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
well
its
not
like
a
one
time
use
and
throw
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
will
stay
there
for
your
entire
family
to
eventually
sit
on
no
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
My
brain
on
that
thing
was
a
one
time
use
and
throw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
will
also
probably
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Someone
’
s
gonna
fix
it
,
eventually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
eventually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
mhmmm
eventually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Someone

[prabipyakurel]
There

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
more
like
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
ll
keep
it
in
mind
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
quick
question
,
how
many
alarms
do
you
have
on
your
phone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
7
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
like
a
few
alarms
person
or
like
15
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Because
I
I
got
one
every
15
min
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
have
one
every
single
minute
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
,
that
’
s
a
reasonable
number
yet
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Every
15
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
From
6
:
30
to
6
:
45
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
There
is
an
alarm
for
every
minute
in
between
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
guess
15
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
If
we
ever
have
a
sleepover
,
this
thing
will
go
off
every
15
min
until
I
get
tired
and
get
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
like
how
your
6
:
20
alarm
says
WAKE
UP
and
the
others
are
just
alarms
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
would
get
sick
of
me
and
my
alarms
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
yea
it
’
s
because
I
want
that
to
be
the
one
time
to
actually
get
up
if
possible
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
you
only
have
7
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
15
*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Unless
you
hit
snooze
and
it
keeps
going
off
you
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
have
to
annoy
myself
with
alarms
to
get
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
even
then
,
I
really
could
just
sleep
through
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Omg
one
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
do
that
,
you
are
not
alone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
just
continue
to
fall
asleep
in
the
weirdest
positions
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
went
to
a
MESA
conference
in
San
Diego
with
my
friend
Anthony
and
it
’
s
basically
a
place
where
you
meet
company
representatives
and
whatever
and
it
was
all
sponsored
for
us
to
go
right
.
We
were
there
for
like
3
days
,
and
Anthony
and
I
shared
a
hotel
room
with
2
beds
right
.
Every
single
morning
,
I
would
literally
have
my
alarms
ring
and
he
got
tired
of
my
shit
one
time
and
literally
turned
off
all
of
my
alarms
so
he
could
go
back
to
sleep
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
what
a
friend
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha

it
could
be
worse
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
My
dad

,
so
none
of
us
sleep
with
our
doors
locked
and
because
all
of
our
rooms
are
like
in
a
row
,
when

alarms

my
dad
across
the
hallway
can
hear

and
he
comes
and
goes
“

stops

[sskarz]
One
alarm

doesn
’
t
cut
it
these
days
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
his
alarm
rings
at

I
can
hear
him
like

and
by
the
time
I
am
like
out
of
the
shower
,
moms
already
downstairs
and
all
,
he
is
barely
fixing
his
bed
,
and
I
give
him
that
glance
and
run
before
he
can
tell
me
anything
about
my
alarm
situation
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
doesn
’
t
and
they
don
’
t
understand
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
this
mf
be
criticizing
ME
when
he
hasn
’
t
even
finished
fixing
the
bed
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
takes
his
sweet
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Surprisingly
makes
it
everywhere
in
time
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
be
moving
so
fast
and
it

like
I
am
late
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Lol

[prabipyakurel]
Your
parents

alarms
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah

and
sometimes
they
forget
to
turn
it
off
so
they
go
on
for
eternity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
parents
like
my
mom

’
t
need
an
alarm
,
they
fr
just
wake
them
self
up
at
6
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
They
got
their
circadian
rhythm
down
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
my
brother
,
he
sleeps
through
the
alarms
,
and
when
his
school
started
a
week
before
I
came
here
,
that
kid
would
set
and
alarm
to
wake
up
at
5
:
30
and
I
would
have
to
go
shut
that
think
up
and
slap
some
sense
into
him
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Takes

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Fixes
his
hair
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
just
takes
so
long
getting
ready
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
He
gets
ready

is
going
to
see
his
girl
at
school
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

meeting
thing
that
they

turns
doing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Meeting

ll

and
go
with
the

yk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

dad
will
literally
look
at
me
and
be
like
“

huh
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
will
get
out
chances
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
this
one
time
,
it
was
a
Saturday
and
you
know
the
one
uncle
with
the
annoying
kid
that
turned
off
your
drum
set
,
yea
we
went
to
their
for
like
a
pre
dashain
celebration
and
a
meeting
thing
.
And
your
parents
were
there
and
all
too
.
And
let
me
tell
you
got
bored
I
was
,
it
was
so
obvious
that
your
dad
came
over
and
was
like
“
you
are
so
bored
right
chhori
”
you
don
’
t
know
how
much
I
wanted
to
just
come
back
home
.
I
thought
you
would
be
there
and
you
weren
’
t
and
I
was
like
damn
.
Then
your
dad
was
like
next
time
you
go
over
to
ours
when
parents
go
somewhere
and
you
can
hang
out
with
them
and
I
was
like
“
maybe
that
day
will
come
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
could
not
wait
to
leave
that
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
There
were
also
so
many
kids
that
day
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
I
remember
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
it
’
s
partly
due
to
the
fact
that
I
had
like
projects
I
had
to
finish
,
and
also
I
remembered
his
little
kid
and
got
instantly
turned
off
by
that
idea
of
seeing
him
again
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
assumed
you
were
busy
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
little
kid
drove
me
nuts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
but
fr
that
little
kid
is
so
arrogant
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
yk
he
’
s
just
a
kid
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
remember
he
cam
over
to
yours
and
he
wanted
to
play
hide
and
seek
and
the
kid
just
hid
in
front
of
us
and
told
us
to
come
seek
him
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
wanted
to
be
like
“
just
saw
you
go
in
the
closet
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Nah
gotta
pretend
you
’
re
blind
yk
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Was

a
kid
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
For

Talk
to

tomorrow

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hey
,
I
hope
you
read
this
in
the
morning
and
not
tonight
,
I
want
you
to
get
good
sleep
,
you
just
travelled
a
long
way
and
you
’
re
most
definitely
tired
,
so
if
you
see
this
before
you
sleep
,
put
the
phone
down
,
go
to
bed
,
and
then
read
the
next
in
the
morning
.
Please
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
haven
’
t
been
able
to
sleep
at
all
,
and
I
can
’
t
until
I
say
some
things
.
First
of
all
,
tonight
was
amazing
.
Seeing
you
again
really
made
me
have
butterflies
in
my
stomach
and
you
looked
stunning
as
always
.
So
thank
you
,
for
being
there
,
it
was
really
nice
seeing
you
again
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Before
I
get
to
my
point
of
this
entire
message
,
please
understand
that
I
’
m
not
mad
at
all
,
and
I
wasn
’
t
at
all
at
any
point
during
tonight
.
I
had
lots
of
fun
!
It
’
s
just
that
I
feel
conflicted
,
in
a
way
that
you
probably
didn
’
t
know
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Going
into
this
party
,
my
entire
reasoning
behind
being
excited
for
tonight
was
to
see
you
,
and
that
was
fulfilled
for
me
.
And
before
the
party
for
the
entire
week
,
we
’
ve
both
been
talking
about
how
excited
we
were
to
see
each
other
and
what
we
would
do
if
opportunities
had
ever
risen
for
the
both
of
us
to
be
isolated
from
the
rest
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
When
I
texted
you
to
come
outside
,
I
saw
that
as
our
one
opportunity
to
actually
be
able
to
talk
to
each
other
properly
.
And
looking
back
on
this
,
I
wish
I
hadn
’
t
.
I
’
m
really
,
deeply
,
sorry
if
it
made
you
super
uncomfortable
.
At
that
moment
,
I
could
tell
you
were
extremely
nervous
and
anxious
about
doing
that
thing
,
and
I
’
m
so
so
sorry
.
It
’
s
my
fault
and
I
should
’
ve
realized
this
sooner
instead
of
trying
to
remedy
it
.
Please
understand
that
if
I
had
known
before
hand
about
how
you
were
going
to
react
,
I
never
would
have
brought
you
out
.
For
that
,
I
am
so
sorry
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
only
expectation
when
it
came
to
seeing
you
outside
was
to
have
a
nice
hug
with
you
.
If
you
thought
I
had
other
intentions
,
please
understand
that
I
only
wanted
the
hug
that
I
promised
.
We
’
re
so
new
into
this
relationship
that
I
don
’
t
want
to
rush
things
that
don
’
t
need
rushing
.
I
love
you
for
you
,
for
who
you
are
as
a
person
,
and
nothing
will
change
that
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
remember
that
you
also
wanted
to
hug
,
and
so
that
’
s
the
only
thing
I
wanted
too
.
I
also
recognize
that
this
is
your
first
time
doing
anything
like
this
with
a
guy
and
I
get
it
.
But
,
your
reaction
threw
me
off
,
and
it
’
s
not
your
fault
,
but
it
kind
of
messed
with
me
tonight
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
A
part
of
me
is
regretful
for
doing
that
in
the
first
place
,
but
another
part
of
me
is
left
wondering
how
I
should
act
with
you
from
here
on
out
.
I
really
wasn
’
t
expecting
the
reaction
from
you
,
but
again
it
’
s
justified
for
the
way
that
I
also
acted
.
We
’
re
both
not
sure
of
the
next
time
we
’
ll
see
each
other
again
,
so
I
wanted
tonight
to
be
special
for
the
two
of
us
.
It
sounds
selfish
I
know
,
but
all
I
wanted
was
to
embrace
you
in
a
nice
hug
,
especially
since
I
’
ve
got
no
idea
if
the
next
time
I
’
ll
see
you
is
in
a
few
months
or
an
entire
year
,
which
is
why
I
feel
so
conflicted
in
the
first
place
.
It
’
s
not
your
fault
,
it
’
s
just
that
I
’
m
going
to
seriously
miss
you
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Again
,
I
’
m
not
mad
at
all
,
trust
me
you
’
ve
gotta
do
something
terrible
to
make
me
mad
even
one
bit
.
But
I
,
my
heart
,
is
confused
of
what
to
think
about
tonight
,
as
great
as
it
was
.
And
I
just
needed
to
get
this
off
my
chest
so
I
can
sleep
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
still
love
you
,
as
much
as
I
did
before
this
entire
event
,
and
never
get
that
twisted
.
You
make
my
world
go
round
some
days
,
and
I
can
’
t
thank
you
enough
for
that
.
But
I
’
m
also
an
honest
person
,
that
wants
to
be
open
about
his
feelings
,
and
I
just
wanted
to
share
this
with
you
.
I
love
you
❤

Hey
,
I
know
you
told
me
to
read
this
in
the
morning
but
I
read
it
now
and
I
am
not
asleep
yet
either
,
sorry
if
I
am
disturbing
you
.
Seeing
you
today
was
magical
and
as
much
as
I
tried
to
keep
it
hidden
,
there
were
so
many
times
where
I
kept
glancing
at
you
.
When
you
made
me
feel
better
about
going
up
to
dance
while
I
was
nervous
and
supported
me
.
Trust
me
I
still
had
butterflies
and
could
not
believe
I
was
seeing
you
.
When
you
called
me
outside
,
I
was
ready
.
But
then
I
stepped
outside
and
saw
some
uncles
that
I
know
that
were
in
the
group
.
But
let
me
tell
you
,
when
you
brought
me
to
your
car
and
gave
me
the
first
glance
,
I
was
just
frozen
,
you
were
so
handsome
and
looked
really
nice
.
But
I
was
hesitating
because
the
uncles
was
walking
back
and
fourth
up
and
down
the
parking
lot
.
And
when
you
pulled
me
in
for
a
hug
,
you
don
’
t
even
know
how
much
I
wanted
to
just
stay
in
that
position
and
for
the
time
to
freeze
.
And
you
don
’
t
ever
need
to
act
differently
forward
me
,
just
talk
to
me
and
see
me
the
same
way
you
see
me
now
.
And
I
didn
’
t
get
inside
the
car
with
you
because
I
was
afraid
that
someone
(
possibly
your
family
)
would
come
to
get
you
or
ask
you
something
and
we
would
be
caught
getting
out
.
when
we
talked
that
time
,
I
was
so
happy
.
Yes
I
was
scared
as
hell
and
so
anxious
,
but
then
I
held
your
hands
and
it
felt
so
good
and
so
safe
.
Don
’
t
apologize
,
going
outside
was
not
a
mistake
and
I
should
be
the
one
apologizing
,
I
made
it
so
awkward
and
I
am
so
sorry
about
that
.
Just
know
that
after
that
interaction
,
I
felt
so
alive
and
so
excited
and
that
meet
with
you
made
my
night
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
sorry
if
anything
I
did
made
you
feel
that
way
.
I
am
so
in
love
with
you
and
will
forever
be
.
For
the
record
you
are
a
gentlemen
and
I
would
never
question
your
intentions
with
me
.
I
knew
I
was
going
for
a
hug
,
and
I
freaked
out
when
I
got
out
there
.
But
after
you
did
hug
me
and
talked
to
me
,
I
started
to
feel
better
.
I
wanted
to
talk
a
little
more
but
I
just
know
either
my
mom
if
not
my
brother
would
come
looking
for
me
and
everyone
would
have
been
looking
for
me
.
And
once
again
I
know
you
told
me
not
to
read
your
text
,
but
I
did
love
.
I
hope
that
this
doesn
’
t
change
anything
about
us
in
anyway
.
I
loved
seeing
you
dance
and
just
dancing
on
the
dance
floor
with
you
.
I
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
night
.
Love
you
so
much
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
sorry
for
messaging
you
late
into
the
night
,
I
love
you
,
please
don
’
t
feel
like
I
am
drifting
away
from
you
.
You
have
all
of
my
heart
.

things
the

and
not
have
to
do
that
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
next
time
I
will
try
to
you
know
not
freak
out
so
much
.
But
in
all
honestly
,
I
loved
that
you
pulled
me
closer
for
the
hug

It

not
your

it
was
kinda
stupid
to
do
that
in
the
first
place
lol
.
Don

blame
yourself
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
hey
hey
,
but
I
hate
it
when
you
say
sorry
to
me
for
something
that
isn

t
your
fault
,
please
don
’

,
it
was

sneaking

Awwwww
yes
you

,
and
you
will
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
am
extremely
sorry
for
making
you
feel
that
way
yesterday
,
I
was
truly
happy
,
I
was
scared
in
the
beginning
that
someone
was
going
to
catch
us
,
because
I
was
afraid
of
loosing
you
and
just
wanted
us
safe
,
however
when
you
held
my
hand
,
I
am
telling
you
it
was
so
amazing
and
I
felt
like
I
was
winning
in
life
when
I
said
bye
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Also
I
would
have
started
crying
if
I
kept
staring
at
you
because
seeing
you
up
close
made
me
realize
how
hard
it
will
be
for
me
to
not
kiss
you
from
all
the
at
over
there
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
love
you
so
much
and
sooner
or
later
we
will
get
our
time
.
I
know
it

.
Thank
you

cheering
me
on
when
I
was
nervous
,

,
I
would

finished
the
entire
jug
of
water
in

my
nosy

and

I

My
sister
looks
at

and
just
gives
me
the
biggest
wink
and

of
them

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
yeah
,
my
morning
started
off
on
a
very
interesting
note
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
woke
up
,
texted
you
,
went
downstairs
and
my
mom
and
sister
were
talking
and
then
I
noticed
,
and
then
we
started
talking
about
last
night
.
The
first
topic
was
:
oh
you
remembered
Prabi
right
?
Are
you
interested
in
her
?
And
I
was
like
uhhhhhhh
everyone
let
’
s
all
relax
for
a
bit
here
I
just
woke
up
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
said
yeah
a
part
of
me
is
interested
and
then
my
mom
was
like
,
well
why
don
’
t
you
guys
talk
more
,
get
her
number
or
something
and
I
was
like
YO
CHILLLLLLL
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Basically
I
had
to
deflect
the
conversation
by
saying
there
’
s
no
way
I
’
d
be
able
to
talk
to
her
consistently
when
she
’
s
studying
like
crazy
and
I
can
’
t
be
a
nuisance
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
I
would
have
taken
a
deep
breath
and
focused
on
you
rather
than
think
about
getting
caught
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
held
your
hand
longer
,
hugged
you
longer
,
just
stay
there
smiling
at
you
longer
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
would

the
past
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

when
you
hugged
me

[prabipyakurel]
No

that
I
was

but
it
was
because
I
was
just
nervous
,
and
I
love
you

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
It

[sskarz]

[sskarz]
Can

I
am
not

to
give
you
the
same
back

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That

on
the
road
that
run
into
the
car
for
money
,
Yea
and
you
metioned
that
your
tesla
has
a
camera
everywhere
,
when
we
met
near
your
car
,
that
wasnt
recorded
or
anything
right
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Sorry

about
it

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
made
sure
before
hand
that
the
feature
was
turned
off
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
thought
about

[sskarz]
No

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mmmm

the
moment
I
walked
in
my
brother
made
eye
contact
with
me
,
I
ran
into
him
at
the
door
because
he
was
looking
for
me
to
use
my
phone
to
take
a
picture
of
something
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thats
good
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Then
what
we
did
was
in
perfect
timing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Had
it
gone
any
longer
,
maybe
it
would
’
ve
been
way
worse
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
guess
so
,
but
I
loved
it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Your

it
might
be
the
only
alone
time
i
might
get
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
If
I
’

be
without
the
burden
of
us
getting
into
trouble
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
sorry
,
but
this
is

I
can

t
risk
something
like
that
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
see
,
I
get
that
,
yea
it
is
more
comfortable
when
we
dont
have
to
look
over
our
shoulders
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
We
wont
,

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ok
this
actually
reminded
me
of
a
funny
story
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
one
time
,
I
brought
over
my
group
of
friends
to
my
house
to
hang
out
and
eat
food
and
whatever
,
and
one
of
my
friends
came
through
MY
FRONT
DOOR
WITH
A
CAMERA
,
wearing
a
suit
,
tophat
,
and
brought
roses
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
was
DONE
and
my
parents
saw
the
camera
feed
and
questioned
me
so
hard
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
prank
was
death
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
if
they
read
our
messages
they
will
think
that
you
are
actually
gay
and
tie
it
together
to
this
one
story
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
What
was
your
explanation
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
That
my
friend
pranked
me
,
and
they
didn
’
t
want
to
believe
that
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I
just
laughed
it
off
and
they
eventually
forgot
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yikes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
must
have
all
questioned
you
for
a
while
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
like
an
hour
of
straight
grilling
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
got
so
mad
at
my
friend
but
it
was
pretty
funny
after
looking
back
at
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol

friend

show
his
love
for
you

way

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

my

this
dada

such
formal
language
when
talking

and
I
was
gonna
say
,
he
does
the
same
for
me
,
but
I
was
like
,
idk
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
didnt
want
him
to
know
that
we
talked
because
then
the
next
time
we
were
brought
up
(
which
we
were
brought
up
frequently
whenever
they
saw
you
anywhere
),
he
would
have
been
like
,

the
time

and
then
my
family
would
be
like
,
why

I
would
always
walk
away
and
smile
after
i
turned
the
corner
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Whenever
your
family

i
guess
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
pizza
,
they
only
had
beef
,
and
then

kinda
gross
tbh
[prabipyakurel]

momos
from

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
german
chocolate
cake
,

alright
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
to
alleviate
some
of
that
homesick
food
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
cant
have
too
much
of
that
either
,
I

get
the
chowmein
from
that
place
sometimes
this
week
though
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
a
mix
of
missing
everyone
and
the
food
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
feels
a
little
out
of
place
,

when
you

him
the
look
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Dude
kept
on
stepping
on
my
dress
with
his
size
10
or
13
shoes
and
I
was
just
ready
to
slap
the
kid
out
of
existence
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
then
you
were
there
just
staring
at
us
and
I
was
like
"
lets
not
do
that
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
stare
,
i
do
that
often
,
and
it
usually
lasts
a
good
30
seconds
before
i
look
away
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

at
you

laughing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

'
t
tempt
me
with
a
good
time
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
we

to
have
a
staring
contest
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
either
over
the
video
call
or

t

getting
mad
at
you
without
laughing
right
after
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
you

you
until

if
you
are
ever
mad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
have
also
seen
me
be
the
most
nervous
person
ever
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
chewing
on
my

my
time
to

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

a
stuffy
nose
I
will
sleep
facing
up

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
one

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No

know
bad
writing

affiliated

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhh
but
seriously
that
was
so
cute
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
mean
it
wasnt
the
hardest
riddle
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
toook
me
5
minutes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
you
didn
’
t
solve
it
in
the
way
I
intended
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
it
was
the
best
trying
to
figure
that
out
and
how
to
tell
you
ofc
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
solved
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
made
it
so
clear
with
the
last
sentence
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
mentioned
that
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
thee
means
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
"
the
letter
that
spelled
you
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
wanted
it
to
rhyme
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
in
front
of
my
face
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
had
no
idea
it
meant
you
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
well
it
served
both
purposes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
such
a
dumbass
hahahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
damn
,
no
i
am
the
idiotic
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

imagine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
far
from
it
love
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
smartest
girl
I
know
I
’
ll
swear
by
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
not
me
and
it
was
another
girl
and
you
added
that
to
make
it
rhyme
,
and
i
said
it
was
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
have
started
looking
for
a
coffin
for
myself
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
the
smartest
boy
out
there
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
you
are
mine
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
🥰
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
What
other
girl
could
it
POSSIBLY
be
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
so
scared
it
was
gonna
be
someone
else
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
going
to
be
yours
forever
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
ready
for
you
to
be
like
,
well
this
girl
(
girls
name
)
is
blah
blah
blah
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Correct
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Literally
that
would
’
ve
just
been
impossible
for
you
to
figure
out
,
I
wouldn
’
t
even
have
bothered
going
through
all
that
riddle
trouble
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
it
was
you
and
I
was
unsure
of
how
you
felt
at
the
time
so
I
did
something
stupid
and
made
a
stupidly
easy
riddle

Yea
when
you
wouldnt
give
up
the
name
I
had
a
feeling
either
i
knew
the
person
or
it
was
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
so
amazing
,
I
will
remember
the
night
you
sent
it
and
solved
it
both
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
There
’
s
no
one
better
than
you
so
that
possibility
was
never
going
to
be
true
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
there
was
no
name
on
that
riddle
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
There
is
no
boy
out
there
that
deserves
a
place
in
ly
life
other
than
you
and
you
remember
that
.

except
I
forgot
the
key
detail
being
that
thee
means
you
but
yk
😭*
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
it
was
a
little
dumb
but
thats
how
i
solved
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
i
was
like
okay
,
either
he
is
going
to
tell
me
its
me
,
or
i
will
slowly
move
away
from
him
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
well
it
must
’
ve
gave
you
some
piece
of
mind
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Oh
thank
god
I
confessed
early
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
hit
me
,
when
you
sent
that
,
a
part
of
my
brain
went
,
"
omg
he
likes
me
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
am
glad
you
did
,
because
a
week
after
that
,
I
saw
you
in
person
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
uh
,
you
got
a
dependent
clause
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
the
sentence
before
the
comma
is
fine
that
’
s
an
independent
clause
,
but
after
the
comma
is
when
that
dependent
clause
starts
but
never
ends
properly
,
thus
making
it
an
incomplete
sentence
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
professor
thapa
,
I
will
note
that
down
.
[prabipyakurel]

I
went
to
my
history
class
from
5
-
5
:
30
and
I
was
like
its
in
the
evening
and
its
not
hot
outside
so
I
didnt
take
water
with
me
and
like
the
moment
I
sat
down
in
class
I
was
like
coughing
and
my
throat
was
itchy
.
I
was
like
shit
.
Usually
when
I
have
water
,
i
dont
need
it
and
today
i
wanted
water
and
I
just
didnt
have
it
with
me
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
remember
,
i
am
getting
better

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

it
with
you
and

that

keep
myself
from

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]

️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
so
basically
,
after
my
boring
english
class
in
which
i
napped
for
a
bit
(
jk
jk
,
just
boring
),
went
to
the
library
and
chilled
out
for
3
hours
and
had
lunch
,
then
had
another
class
that
was
interesting
and
difficult
math
stuff
,
but
i
was
expecting
my
lsat
class
to
be
a
total
snore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
this
last
class
that
i
had
,
it
'
s
been
SO
boring
the
last
3
weeks
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
today
,
my
professor
didn
'
t
change
anything
,
except
there
were
like
5
students
that
didn
'
t
do
the
stuff
from
last
class
,
or
not
properly
anyway
for
the
setup
for
today
'
s
class
,
so
the
class
was
just
recapping
for
them
.
Why
?
Because
my
teacher
is
super
slow
,
and
he
has
a
THICK
asian
accent
and
people
can
'
t
understand
him
really
and
it
made
for
the
most
hilarious
moments
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
professor
got
so
fed
up
of
trying
to
help
these
students
navigate
their
computer
,
he
started
yelling
and
laughing
at
them
,
and
my
friend
and
i
were
DYING
in
the
front
row
of
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
laughed
so
hard
we
started
crying
because
it
was
that
hilarious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
what
a
professor
,
i
mean
if
he
had
a
thick
asian
accent
and
started
yelling
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
,
I
would
be
laughing
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
should
have
taken
a
picture
of

,
you

looked
so
dumb
crying
while
laughing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
that
feeling

,
we
had
an
hour
and
a
half
for

stuff
we

'
ve

MAX
20
minutes

did
it
on
their
own
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

nice
change
of
pace
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
so
hyped
for
this
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
its
supposed
to
be
a
lot
of
teamwork
,
and
like
we
are
all
supposed
to
work
on
a
singular
project
the
entire
semester
to
then
present
it
at
the
end
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
haven
'
t
,
even
made
groups
yet
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
its
been
3
WEEKS
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
ve
got
no
faith
in
this
professor
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
fr
so
slow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
it
seemed
like
you

a
fun
class
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
thanks
to
those
5
students
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
for
once
,
yeah
i
felt
kinda
bad
afterwards
,
i
didn
'
t
want
them
to
think
that
i
was
laughing
at
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
well
they
probably
did
idiot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
i
was
just
laughing
at
the
fact
that
the
professor
started
getting
frustrated
hahaha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
eh
it
is
what
it
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
no
i
was
kidding
,
no
they
probably
understood
why
you
were
dying
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
showed
my
professor
the
work
for
the
class
,
and
he
was
like
,
alright
for
those
of
you
that
already
did
this
stuff
,
leave
and
those
that
haven
'
t
stay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
just
left
out
the
door
in
like
30
minutes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Genius
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
probably
gonna
be
an
easy
A
,
but
i
won
'
t
learn
anything
in
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
meh
its
alright
,
just
go
with
the
flow
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
the
most
basic
shit
prabi
,
i
have
3rd
year
compsci
majors
in
my
class
that

'
t

how
to
navigate
a
macbook
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

key
embarrassing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
tbh

how
to
navigate
though
it
either
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
ur
not
a

[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
finished
todays
summary
,
and
2
readings
,
and
worked
more
in
the
sociology
project
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
well
...
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
are
already
done
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'

my
hardworking
queen

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
done
these
before
,
I
just
feel
like
I
will
miss
a
step
tomorrow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
pretty
simple
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
i
remember
this
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
hated
doing
these
because
it
took
so
much
space
on
a
page
to
do
a
single
problem
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
These
are
my
favorite
type
of
problems
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
fr
they
do
take
up
so
much
space
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
my
handwriting
is
a
little
big
,
so
I
take
up
a
lot
of
space
to
write
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
so
much
conversion
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
like
factoring
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
factoring
is
fun
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
wait
till
you
get
to
derivative
problems
,
so
much
easier
and
takes
little
space
to
do
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
its
just
some
wont
factor
and
thats
when
i
get
mad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
hope
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
know
that
feeling
too
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
its
a
love
story
that
doesn
'
t
end
well
,
it
'
s
got
a
really
really
heart
wrenching
story
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
win
win
for
me
;)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
yikes
,
no
some
stories
are
really
good
,
but
its
just
the
ending
that
messes
with
me
sometimes
yk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
awwww
you
are
the
sweetest
person
ever
,
lol
it
would
be
a
win
win
for
me
too
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
yeahhhh
,
well
since
we
probably
won
'
t
watch
it
together
soon
,
its
about
a
guy
and
a
girl
that
meet
and
fall
out
of
love
through
crazy
action
events
,
and
they
start
to
learn
how
to
live
with
each
other
'
s
feelings
.
Except
the
story
takes
place
in
a
cyberpunk
universe
and
the
main
protaganist
does
anything
for
the
security
of
his
love
,
so
he
sacrifices
himself
for
her
safety
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
in
the
end
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
made
me
full
on
cry
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
remember
watching
the
ending
and
i
had
so
many
tears
running
down
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
,
no
thats
kinda
sad
.
I
have
watched
a
lot
of
movies
when
someone
dies
and
I
have
to
look
away
from
the
TV
so
I
dont
cry
like
crazy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
would
sacrifice
myself
for
my
love
any
day
,
anytime
and
do
anything
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
would
do
anything
for
you
,
even
if
it
means
I
have
to
push
everything
away
for
you

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
this
song
was
so
fun
before
watching
the
show
,
and
then
I
start
tearing
up
if
I
listen
to
it
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Then
dont
listen
to
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
but
its
so
beautiful
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
it
just
be
so
good
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
maybe
because
you
have
watched
the
show
and
watched
what
happened
,
you
probably
cry
thinking
of
the
scene
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
no
yeah
totally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
you
don
'
t
know
what
happens
in
the
show
,
then
its
a
good
song
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
after
you
realize
,
its
like
man
.
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

Ty

[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
really
is
,
you
know
it
reminds
me
of
something
actually
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
,
before
I
graduated
like
during
prom
week
,
in
our
AP
government
class
,
everyone
was
talking
about
who
they
were
going
to
prom
with
and
then
when
they
asked
me
I
was
like
"
uh
dont
know
,
dont
really
like
anyone
,
and
I
told
them
I
would
probably
go
alone
.
And
then
my
ap
government
teacher
was
all
like
Prabi
it
may
not
seem
like
you
like
anyone
now
,
but
trust
me
when
you
go
to
berkeley
you
will
find
a
nepali
boy
just
for
you
,
and
I
thought
she
was
crazy
for
thinking
I
would
be
dating
someone
right
after
high
school
.
But
being
here
with
you
and
talking
to
you
and
falling
in
love
with
you
has
really
been
willd
and
been
so
amazing
.
[prabipyakurel]

love
you
!

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
know
I
have
actually
done
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Really
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
not
to
you
but
to
one
of
my
friends
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
so
,
what
happened
was
after
I
was
done
texting
you
,
it
was
like
a
week
after
july
4th
,
and
it
was
a
wednesday
or
something
and
I
had
a
dream
that
there
were
people
and
dogs
chasing
me
down
the
street
and
every
house
that
I
would
go
to
the
doors
would
not
open
and
like
I
was
just
panicking
and
running
.
But
then
I
tripped
or
something
and
woke
up
.
I
was
so
scared
,
I
could
not
even
get
up
to
turn
on
the
light
.
I
had
never
felt
that
way
before
,
so
like
I
opened
discord
and
realized
that
one
of
my
friends
saira
would
normally
be
up
past
12
,
so
I
messaged
her
like
an
entire
paragraph
and
told
her
to
just
talk
to
me
because
I
was
really
scared
.
But
then
after
like
5
minutes
of
sending
that
,
I
just
deleted
the
message
,
I
didnt
want
to
disturb
her
.
Then
I
put
together
the
courage
to
walk
down
the
hall
to
my
parents
and
went
there
to
"
drink
water
"
because
they
have
a
water
jug
.
And
my
dad
was
like
,
did
you
have
a
nightmare
,
and
I
just
talked
to
them
a
little
bit
(
not
about
the
nightmare
)
just
general
,
and
it
felt
better
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
still
remember
that
night
,
it
was
pretty
scary
,
I
didnt
know
what
to
do
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Omg
that
does
sound
really
terrifying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Well

that
happens
again
,

’
t
be
afraid
to
text
me
,

text
me

me

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ooooooooooh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The

considering
they

been
giving
only
beef
for
the
past
2
days
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
This

And

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
swear
to
god
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
been
through
it
so
much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
understand
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
terrible
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
’
m
ready
to
switch
back
to
android
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
were
once
an
android
user
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Always
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Judging
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
This
is
my
first
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Having
an
iPhone
as
my
daily
phone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
In
nearly
12
years
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wow
,
yea
some
of
my
friends
have
android
phones
and
I
always
look
at
it
like
how
the
hell
do
you
use
thing
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
a
pretty
long
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
I
’
ve
been
using
the
iPhone
for
like
11
months
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
’
s
been
good
like
actually
jokes
aside
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
wouldn
’
t
mind
android
or
iPhone
,
both
have
pros
and
cons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
sometimes
I
’
m
like
,
apple
whyyyyyy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
i
was
messing
with
you
,
android
has
got
its
reasons
,
but
seriously
sometimes
apple
really
be
a
pain
in
the
ass
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hahaha
it
’
s
really
not
that
complicated
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
the
reason
people
think
like
that
about
android
is
because
there
are
so
many
more
options
to
do
stuff
that
it
gets
overwhelming
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
its
not
,
but
I
have
been
so
used
to
apple
,
and
some
android
phones
are
actually
confusing
believe
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
maybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
iPhone
is
definitely
simpler
to
use
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
why
many
people
like
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Just
for
that
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
I
’
m
a
tech
nerd
so
I
gotta
try
out
everything
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
took
my
friends
android
phone
with
the
pattern
password
thing
and
used
to
just
keep
trying
until
it
disabled
his
phone
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
feel
so
bad
now

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

it
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I

done
.
I

’
t
stop
coughing
and
sniffling
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
,
I
think
the
Covid
spread
in
this
are
is
still
high
,
so
many
people
are
missing
from
classes
and
stuff
and
everyone
is
kinda
just
sick
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
I
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
could
’
ve
been
caught
up
in
the
wave
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Most
likely
,
like
yesterday
morning
it
wasn
’
t
bad
,
but
like
in
the
afternoon
,
even
though
my
windows
were
closed
,
I
needed
to
put
on
a
jacket
because
I
felt
cold
,
I
think
that
’
s
when
it
really
kind
of
started
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
flu
season
is
coming
up
too
so
that
is
also
probably
the
reason
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
hey
,
keep
yourself
warm
and
drink
lots
of
water
,
and
take
medicine
if
you
can
and
rest
for
today
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Make
sure
you
eat
nutrient
rich
foods
too
,
your
body
will
recover
quicker
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
,
and
yes
I

gotten
better
at
drinking
more
water
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I

food
choices

since
I

to
Berkeley
,
I
have
been
sick
like
twice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

the
3rd
time
actually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
tough
to
get

a
snack
like
a
protein

and
you

just
be
like

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like

everytime

I

every
morning
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
she
will
introduce
herself
to
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
dont
see
how
this
is
gonna
lead
to
a
problem
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
a
phone
call
to
parents
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
someone
dropped
you
off
and
we
met
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
think
the
only
way
we
can
make
this
work
is
if
there
is
an
event
at
either
your
house
or
mines
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
your
know
your
way
around
your
family
and
know
how
to
slightly
fool
mine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

'
s

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
wow

is
much
harder
than
i

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
especially
with

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
my
parents

like
strict
strict
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ok
but

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
what
if
i
was
the
one
that
met
up
with
your
parents
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
yk
,
we
'
re
just
friends
and
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
they
know
me
,
and
they
might
just
think
we
'
d
be
hanging
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wait
like
we
told
them
you
randomly
will
be
going
to
the
same
place
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
like
if
you
were
heading
to
a
park
,
like
just
say
i
invited
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
would
they
be
suspicious
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
so
here
is
the
thing
,
you
would
have
to
act
like
you
want
to
go
somewhere
where
my
parents
wont
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
you
gotta
bring
it
up
at
random
and
be
like
,
"
maybe
prabi
wants
to
go
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
ask
me
if
i
like
roller
coasters
and
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
possibly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
will
say
yea
she
is
also
crazy
and
we
are
not
going
with
her
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
wait
like
ask
you
over
text
and
then
u
show
them
the
texts
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
not
texts
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
this
has
to
happen
when
we
actually
meet
once
and
then
from
that
point
forward
,
they
wont
really
question
if
i
go
out
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
assume
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ohhhhhhhhhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
if
we
were
at
an
event
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yeaaaaaaa
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
i
bring
that
up
to
you
and
your
parents
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
just
randomly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
when
we
all
sitting
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hm
here
'
s
a
potential
problem
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
if
your
brother
happens
to
be
in
this
conversation
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
exactly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
there
you
go
,
that
kid
will
just
follow
everywhere
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
unless
he
has
school
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
tell
him
to
shove
off
for
just
a
day
,
i
just
want
you
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
jk
jk
jk
that
'
s
mean
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lol
no
he
will
be
like
sanskar
is
going
,
great
I
am
coming
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
I
had
a
conversation
with
him
and
he
started
off
by
saying
"
there
is
something
about
sanskar
dada
,
i
talked
to
him
about
his
discord
status
and
he
is
just
awesome
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
to
pretend
like
I
had
not
seen
your
status
for
a
second
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
lets
take
your
brother
as
a
third
wheel
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
be
the
third
wheel
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
trust
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
omg
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
he
will
be
like
"
you
wanna
leave
us
alone
for
a
bit
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
would
be
hilarioussssssss
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
damn
this
is
so
hard
because
not
only
are
your
parents
strict
,
but
wherever
you
go
,
your
brother
is
there
too
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
imma
be
the
dog
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
exactly
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
if
you
drive
,
that
kid
will
sit
in
the
front
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
guarantee
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
there
are
2
criteria
here
:
[sskarz]
1
.
Your
parents
need
to
be
okay
with
you
being
somewhere
knowing
or
without
knowing
that
I
'
m
there
,
whatever
suits
that
condition
better
[sskarz]
2
.
Your
brother
must
be
isolated
from
the
plan
of
you
and
I
meeting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
there
you
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Pinned
a
message
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
be
glad
you
'
re
dating
a
CS
major
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
whole
thing
is
to
solve
problems
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
solve
this
over
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
a
you
problem
buddy
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
'
ll
think
about
it
every
morning
and
keep
it
in

much
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

a
weird
night
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
What
happened
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
had
like
5
dreams
,
all
of
which
were
kind
of
really
weird
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
um
the
first
one
was
about
this
family
where
apparently
a
little
boy
got
run
over
by
a
car
and
I
woke
up
right
after
but
it
felt
real
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
I
had
a
dream
that
I
almost
got
hit
by
a
car
but
got
yelled
at
for
standing
in
the
way
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
after
those
2
,
I
couldnt
really
sleep
,
it
was
around
3
-
4
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
really
scared
for
a
while
,
and
watched
insta
for
a
few
minutes
to
calm
myself
down
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
fell
asleep
for
a
little
more
around
6
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
got
up
around
7
:
30
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
wow
,
that
sounds
terrifying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Are
you
sure
you
got
enough
sleep
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
slept
well
dw
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
fine
,
I
feel
good
right
now
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
like
at
night
,
I
knew
it
was
a
dream
and
I
was
scared
to
like
even
get
down
from
my
bed
and
walk
around
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
okay
love
just
don
’
t
worry
about
all
that
stuff
,
it
’
s
just
a
dream
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
At
least
you
got
good
sleep
still
,
but
I
won
’
t
lie
that
is
pretty
weird
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
it
is
,
I
didnt
even
know
the
boy
that
got
run
over
but
like
it
was
like
a
movie
scene
and
the
kid
broke
his
leg
and
I
just
woke
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
sad
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
that
sounds
really
sad
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
At

it
’

only
a
dream
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
I
am

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
had
a
weird
dream
as
well
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Apparently
I
was
talking
to
a
therapist
and
explaining
what
was
going
on
with
someone
’
s
death
,
but
I
had
no
idea
who
I
was
talking
about
.
And
the
therapist
was
just
nodding
their
head
,
and
then
I
realized
wtf
was
going
on
and
then
I
woke
up

Nepali
people
fr
gonna
be
like
“

saw
that
coming
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
who
knew
,
the
smartest
nepali
kids
would
fall
in
love
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not

toot
our

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
absolutely
right
,
and
it
’
s
great
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Just
the
best
love

out
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Now
that
I
think
about
it
,
idk
if
there
are
any
Nepali
people
that
we
know
that
are
dating
another
Nepali
person
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Or
is
it
just
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
actually
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
true
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
never
thought
about
it
like
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
just
thought
about
it
too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
nothing
is
coming
to
mind
,
not
a
single
nepali
person
i
know
is
dating
a
nepali
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
mind
blown
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
maybe
they
have
dated
or
are
dating
non
Nepali
people
but
I
can
’
t
think
of
any
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
know
,
let
me
tell
you
something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
so
glad
i
'
m
with
you
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
our
cultures
match
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
because
let
me
tell
you
,
dating
someone
of
a
different
culture
,
is
so
wack
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
with
you
,
we
both
know
how
to
speak
and
do
nepali
things
,
and
it
is
just
so
much
better
this
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg
you
don
’
t
even
know
,
a
few
years
before
I
met
you
I
am
like
there
is
really
no
perfect
Nepali
boy
here
for
me
and
I
thought
it
would
be
really
hard
to
find
anyone
,
lol
who
knew
you
and
me
were
waiting
to
happen
.
I
am
so
happy
that
I
am
dating
a
Nepali
person
,
it
hits
different
when
you
can
talk
shit
about
someone
in
a
different
language
and
eat
amazing
Nepali
food
without
being
like
“
you
like
it
”.
I
can
’
t
even
imagine
dating
someone
that
isn
’
t
Nepali
tbh
,
just
never
been
on
my
mind
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
hell
our
families
know
each
other
really
well
too
,
just
a
bonus
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
seriously
,
it
just
makes
things
so
much
more
enjoyable
and
relatable
,
and
our
families
aren
'
t
an
issue
at
all
really
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
just
feel
so
safe
and
secure
with
our
relationship
together
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
that
'
s
something
I
never
knew
before
hand
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It

s
one
of
the
reason
I
wanted
to
wait
to
find
the
right
one
and
not
end
up
dating
some
white
dude
because
for
me
I
always
knew
something
would
not
work
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Now

I
reread
some
old
texts
from
you
,
you
have
been
giving
some
decent
hints
that
I
simple
just
looked
at

some
texts

back
to
prior

when

and
I
am
like
,

this
fool

me
all
along
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

ray
of
sunshine
and

'
t
bat

eye
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
for
so
long
,
after
seeing
my
friends
and
their
love
life
,
I
was
just
used
to
giving
advice
to
people
who
liked
others
,
lol
this
was
the
first
time
so
I
was
just
like
meh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
now
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
said
,
that
’
s
what
friends
are
for
,
just
so
you
didn
’
t
think
I
was
weird
or
anything
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😵
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Was
that
you
when
I
replied
with
a
thank
you
!
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
called
me
a
friend
and
i
was
dead
asf
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
like

overrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
kept
going
JUST
IN
CASE
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
I
am
so
glad
you
did
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
took
time
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
on
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hahaha
i
know
i

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
your
first
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
get
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hard
to
see
these
things
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
but
I
am
telling
you
honestly
when
I
was
texting
you
like
even
for
the
first
3
weeks
or
so
,
I
was
like
flying
in
the
air
,
I
also
got
really
scared
that
after
college
started
we
would
stop
talking
because
you
would
have
your
own
thing
and
I
would
have
my
own
,
but
boy
am
I
happy
with
the
way
things
turned
out
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
“
well
hey
,
I
'
m
gonna
head
to
bed
pretty
soon
now
,
but
I
do
want
to
say
one
thing
.
We
'
ve
been
talking
everyday
for
like
3
weeks
now
,
and
I
just
wanna
say
I
have
looked
forward
to
talking
with
you
since
then
:).
Hope
you
have
a
good
night
and
sleep
well
!
💤
😴”
-
you
know
when
you
said
this
,
i
kept
reading
it
over
like
20
times
,
I
’
m
like
so
do
you
like
me
or
what
???
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
was
really
shooting
my
shot
there
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
was
worried
that
maybe
you
'
d
get
bored
or
something
,
so
I
wanted
to
say
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
never
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Lol
and
like
an
idiot
I
replied
by
saying
,
yea
dude
it
’
s
nice
talk
to
you
too
,
anyway
gn
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
when
you
said
that
to
me
,
I
was
like
he
is
either
gonna
be
my
boyfriend
or
he
is
gonna
be
another
one
of
my
best
friends
in
life
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
I
got
both
,
that
is
rare
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
boyfriend
and
best
friend
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
have
no
idea
,
i
looked
at
that
and
went
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
but
no
that
was
the
first
sign
I
picked
up
on
for
a
while
and
forgot
about
it
eventually
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
there
was
no
way
of
you
knowing
without
me
saying
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
or
that
dumb
poem
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
lmao
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
a
love
story
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
I
would
have
chickened
out
and
didn
’
t
wanna
loose
you
as
a
friend
either
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
’
m
like
we
gonna
keep
going
until
he
tells
me
he
has
some
girl
and
I
am
just
his
friend
or
he
tells
me
he
likes
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
wanted
you
as
my
girl
for
so
long
haha
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
didn
'
t
want
to
potentially
lose
you
as
a
friend
either
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
d
rather
have
you
as
my
friend
then
having
to
choose
to
ignore
you
at
every
function
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
imagine
I
confessed
and
you
were
like
“
I
am
sorry
”
oh

is
the
last
time

[sskarz]
speaking

grown
adults
that

something
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
scared
of
needles

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
remember
a
time
that
i
took
a
trip
to
hawaii
,
got
my
scar
accident
,
and
the
way
back
to
california
,
the
pilot
gave
me
his
metal
pin
on
his
suit
that
basically
signifies
that
you
'
re
a
pilot
one
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
idk
where
that
metal
pin
is
now
,
but
it
was
pretty
cool
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
nah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
are
you
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

’
s

sweet
.
And
you

hurt
too
so
…
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
,
never
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
is
like
a
Prajjwal
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
he
probably
felt
bad
for
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
had
like
a
big
cloth
on
my
face
hiding
the
stitches
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
can
i
ask
something
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Awww
damn
,
hey
but
glad
it
didn
’
t
like
get
to
your
eye
or
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
fr
real
clumsy
for
getting
hurt
at
a
water
park
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
are
you
anemic
?
like
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Okay
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
I
am
not
,
at
least
I
don
’
t
think
so
,
but
the
last
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
went
to
the
doctors
and
it
showed
that
my
blood
level
was
pretty
low
,
I
was
on
iron
pills
for
like
2
months
but
now
I
assume
it
’
s
fine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Last
time
I
checked
it
was
not
the
best
but
it
’
s
at
a
good
level
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
you
'
re
probably
not
anemic
,
just
was
low
for
a
little
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
’
s
probably
what
it
was
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
the
way
my
mom
made
me
drink
water
,
juice
,
and
made
so
much
saag
so
it
would
go
back
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
had
beet
root
juice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
thing
is
like
🤢
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
omg
but
that
'
s
good
,
you
probably
avoided
becoming
anemic
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
coffee
and
soda
was
off
limits
for
a
long
time
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha
yeah
i
get
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
,
lol
mom
be
moms
,
I
love
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Are
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
just
ask
if
you
'
re
anemic
because
i
am
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
have
a
rare
case
of
anemia
called
thalassemia
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
chronic
and
genetic
,
but
nothing
dangerous
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
just
means
i
have
less
hemoglobin
than
the
average
person
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
get
tired
easier
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
I
see
,
yea
take
care
of
yourself
.
I
appreciate
you
sharing
though
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
and
its
not
like
a
severe
case
at
all
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
dw
about
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
ok
ok
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
its
pretty
minor
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
just
something
i
thought
you
should
know
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
because
my
dads
hemoglobin
level
dropped
and
that
had
problems
so
just
stay
safe
Sanskar
,
take
care
of
yourself
and
don
’
t
take
in
too
much
work
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
thank
you
for
sharing
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
love
don
'
t
worry
,
i
know
my
limits
well
but
i
appreciate
your
concern
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
also
,
a
completely
unrelated
note
but
another
reason
i
asked
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
if
two
people
are
anemic
,
they
can
'
t
have
children
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not
related
at
all
,
but
just
something
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Mhm
okay
nice
to
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
unfortunately
its
genetic
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
my
kids
will
most
likely
have
it
too
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
’
s
okay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
yea
if
it
’
s
genetic
lol
most
likely
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
as
long
as
its
not
both
people
,
then
its
fine
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
very
minor
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
anywho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
never
knew
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
my
family
has
like
tons
of
history
of
medical
stuff
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
yea
and
your
sis
is
a
nurse
so
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
she
can
'
t
treat
my
chronic
disease
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

deal
at
all

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
like
a
full
math
day
.
So
I
finished
all
my
sociology
and
English
reading
or
scanning
in
the
morning
,
then
went
to
office
hours
and
worked
on
problems
for
math
for
an
hour
or
so
.
Then
went
to
my
actual
math
lecture
where
I
fell
asleep
and
it
was
funny
because
I
fell
asleep
in
such
a
way
that
the
notebook
on
the
table
fell
on
the
floor
with
the
pencils
and
everything
😂.
And
then
got
back
,
worked
on
quite
a
lot
more
math
problems
that
I
was
weak
on
,
and
just
finished
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Still
gonna
go
the
same
tomorrow
morning
and
then
I
think
I
got
it
!

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Oh

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

I
will
love
,
you
don
’
t
even
know
for
so
long
,
I
doubted
myself
with
a
lot
of
things
in
life
,
but
now
that
I
reflect
back
,
I
am
like
,
I
had
that
thing
tho
.
Didn
’
t
know
what
I
was
so
scared
of
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
I
am
telling
you
if
more
than
2
good
things
were
happening
to
me
,
I
always
thought
that
there
was
something
bad
waiting
for
me
that
was
waiting
to
happen
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
something
i
like
to
call
,
"
being
scared
of
ghosts
".
if
there
'
s
nothing
there
to
scare
you
,
then
there
is
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
no
i
totally
get
that
,
i
used
to
think
the
exact
same
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
until
i
realized
that
i
control
the
outcomes
of
things
that
i
care
about
,
and
its
just
been
good
things
after
good
things
,
hasn
'
t
stopped
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
as
long
as
you
are
focused
on
the
things
you
need
and
want
,
then
you
can
control
how
you
want
things
to
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
most
things
anyway
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
now
if
here
is
no
reason
for
me
to
be
scared
,
I
will
just
try
and
go
for
it
.

Went

and
cheeseballs
at
walgreens
and
then

chilling
alone
[prabipyakurel]

I

of
scared
about
what

to
my
overall
grades
,
especially
because
the
midterms

and
said
,
"

[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

a
club
meeting
and
the
guy
said
,
"

this
gonna
become
a
routine
where

just
leave
lab
?"
and
i
had
to
explain
to
him
that
i
finished
all
the
work
beforehand
and
proved
it
and
then
he
let
me
go
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
he
'
s
such
a
bitch
boy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

all
sitting
at
a
circle
table
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
my
sister
is
to
my
right
,
and
we
were
just
talking
about
how
she
found
some
really
attractive
guy
at
the
gym
and
im
just
making
fun
of
her
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
then
she
starts
talking
about
my
nonexistant
love
life
that
she
has
no
idea
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
then
she
suddenly
goes
,
"
oh
so
do
you
think
Prabi
is
pretty
hm
?"
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
while
everyone
else
was
talking
before
this
,
EVERYONE
at
the
table
DRILLED
THEIR
EYES
ON
ME
like
a
bomb
was
just
dropped
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

give
you
the
death
stare

she
thinks
i

say
no
for
now
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]

"

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

I
will

No
I
’
m
high
school
,
there
were
like
exercising
machines
on
the
second
floor
so
when
we
finished
warmup
we
would
go
up
there
.
And
there
was
this
one
where
you
would
have
to
like
set
the
thing
for
how
heavy
you
want
it
on
both
sides
and
pull
inward
and
I
used
to
put
it
more
than
I
could
do
and
when
I
let
go
,
I
would
launch
myself
somewhere
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
there
was
an
actual
gym
also
for
weight
training
and
wrestlers
but
the
one
we
went
to
it
was
like
6
or
7
machines
that
everyone
played
until
the
weight
lifting
class
came
and
then
I
would
just
leave
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhh
I
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
if
I
see
something
similar
to
those
,
I
will
know
how
to
use
some
because
I
I
have
watched
people
use
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
trust
me
,
a
lot
of
machines
in
the
gym
work
very
similarly
together
,
just
gotta
know
what
the
tiny
differences
are
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And

I
like
to
do
at
the
end
of
math
problems
is
try
to
prove
my
own
answer
wrong
,
step
by
step
,
and
if
I
can
’
t
find
a
way
to
prove
it
wrong
,
then
I
know
I
’
m
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Idk
if
you
’
ve
ever
done
that
,
but
that
’
s
what
really
helped
me
to
avoid
those
small
mistakes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahh
,
no
I
will
try
that
for

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hey
,
the
key
factor
to
making
no
mistakes
is
believing
in
yourself
and
your
math
solving
abilities
.
The
more
practice
you
do
,
the
more
confident
you
become
,
and
once
you
’
re
comfortable
with
a
specific
type
of
problem
,
you
can
move
onto
the
next
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
just
this
one
thing
that
I
can
make
a
real
impact
even
being
so
far
from
you
,
I
wanna
make
sure
you
use
me
to
lift
yourself
up
okay
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
love
you
and
I
’
m
always
believing
in
you
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
,
I
will
go
in
and
do
my
best
on
that
thing
.
And
I
will
continue
practicing
more
and
more
until
I
have
gotten
all
of
them
down
.

Your

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You

me
them
even
when
I
was
like
whispering
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Haha
I
was
barely
awake
so
I
don

t
doubt
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
My
heart
does
what
my
heart
wants
to
do
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
you
did
and
it
was
cute
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Then
you
told
me
to
fall
asleep
and
I
think
I
did
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I

t
even

when
the
call
ended
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Me

,
I
woke

and
the
call

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
I

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

I
didn
’
t
,
I
fell
asleep
before
I

end
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
were
whispering
something
and
I
just
slept
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Knowing
me
,
I
probably
smacked
my
phone
while
I
was
asleep
and
hit
the
end
call
button
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

up

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Have
you
done
this
before
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
reminds
me
of
piecewise
functions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
that
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
what
is
the
section
called
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
oh
it
is
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Absolute
values
and
piecewise
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
from
what
it
looks
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
you
'
re
given
an
x
value
,
that
can
only
be
substituted
into
one
of
the
functions
depending
on
its
range
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Wait
no
shit
,
you
in
class
,
explain
later
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Get
back
to

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

help
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
ok
ok
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
would
I
plug
in
all
those
x
values
to
see
which
one
is
a
solution
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yes
you
would
get
a
solution
based
on
what
you
get
for
x
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
u
would
substitute
x
into
whatever
function
that
has
the
appropriate
range
for
that
x
value
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh
gotcha
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
for
example
,
if
you
have
x
>=
2
as
your
range
,
and
you
have
a
value
x
=
1
,
you
can
'
t
substitute
that
since
its
not
in
its
range
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
if
it
was
x
=
2
,
then
u
could
and
there
is
a
solution
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
this
is
all
coming
from
memory
,
so
you
should
definitely
double
check
if
you
can
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
no
it
makes
sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
did
it
for
one
and
I
will
do
it
for
the
rest
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thank
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

,
double
check
tho
!

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
saw
ur
msg
but
I
was
about
to
drive
and
I
was
talking
to
someone
on
the
side
and
I
didn
’
t
want
them
to
see
ur
name
lol
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
how
was
your
study
session
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
thats
alright
love
,
I
realized
you
would
be
driving
so
i
wanted
to
wait
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
went
well
,
i
was
in
there
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
I
have
not
prepared
enough
,
I
am
literally
still
working
on
reviewingthe
key
terms
and
such
.
Other
than
that
,
I
went
to
the
office
hours
for
the
full
2
hours
and
learned
some
new
things
.
Then
attended
the
math
lecture
where
he
brought
up
a
new
topic
,
still
processing
that
.
I
finished
my
timeline
but
realized
that
my
resources
also
need
explanation
so
need
to
work
on
that
.
Also
found
out
that
we
still
got
math
homework
due
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
so
gonna
start
on
that
in
a
little
bit
.
Um
then
I
got
my
philosophy
reading
out
of
the
way
for
tomorrow
.
But
yea
not
I
am
just
doing
whatever
I
can
to
prepare
for
all
2
exams
I
have
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
sorry
that
was
a
lot
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

your
plate
,

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
am
fine
,
just
trying
to
get
through
all
of
it
,
just
when
I
thought
math
was
getting
better
,
I
literally
ran
across
so
many
other
things
i
needed
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Eh
it
was
okay
,
got
hit
by
some
heavy
stuff
in
lectures
with
tons
of
math
so
I
’
m
still
processing
it
all
,
and
I
guess
that
’
s
about
it
really
.
Nothing
too
interesting
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

it
,

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Just
focus
on
one
thing
at
a
time
,
trying
to
cover
all
at
the
same
time
will
do
you
no
good
,
so
focus
on
honing
your
skills
on
a
specific
type
of
problem
,
get
confident
,
then
move
on

Okay

just

I

but
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Was
it
truly
a
good
thing
that
Julius
Caesar
died
from
the
Roman
Empire
era
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
if
we
really
think
about
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
ended
the
civil
war
and
voted
for
dictator
for
life
,
conquered
countries
like
Spain
before
it
was
formed

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Made

with
Egypt
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
wtf
,
literally
that
is
what
you
wanted
to
ask
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
I
just
dunno
,
how
much
impact
did
he
really
have
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
like
a
moral
dilemma
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
He
had
3
triumphs
that
are
paraded
for
military
accomplishments
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Heavily
decorated
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
when
he
died
,
he
lost
all
influence
on
the
Roman
Empire
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
,
really
was
it
a
good
thing
?
With
how
it
all
ended
up
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Truly
an
interesting
thing
I
was
thinking
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
bro
he
is
dead
and
long
gone
,
cremated
,
probably
scattered
all
over
the
place
,
leave
him
in
peace
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
he
is
dead
dead

busy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
I
started
with
sociology
which
was
pretty
simple
(
other
than
the
fact
that
my
water
bottle
was
loose
and
I
had
it
in
my
backpack
so
I
spilled
some
in
there
).
Then
I
went
to
philosophy
and
got
some
more
clarification
on
terms
and
understood
them
better
.
I
went
to
sociology
office
hours
straight
hours
to
tell
him
to
check
my
timeline
project
and
realized
I
was
still
missing
some
formating
things
.
I
had
lunch
and
started
on
math
(
we
still
have
homework
and
midterms
this
week
),
and
I
attended
a
zoom
math
session
for
some
topics
so
that
was
helpful
.
I
went
to
my
last
history
class
for
the
day
which
was
normal
and
simple
.
I
had
dinner

finalized
the
timeline
project

turned
it
in
.

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
not
gonna
like
,
I
was
freaking
out
before
but
after
I
discovered
how
the
library
worked
and
all
,
I
wanted
to
sit
in
there
and
just
read
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Its
so
nice
and
quiet
in
there
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
have
only
seen
like
1
floor
of
that
library
,
i
will
do
some
more
visits
to
that
place
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
haha

,
this
is
why

also
just
go
to
the
library
on
campus

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

so
there
are
so
many
books
and
shelves
that
a
lot
of
the
shelves

so
close
together
and

have
to
move
this
big
handle
just
to
open
up
that
section
that
you
want
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
that
i
fit
in
very
well
so

i
needed
were
kept
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
once
i
found
them
tbh
,
i
didnt
know
where
any
of
the
exits
were
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

Hey
love
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
How
would
I
start
this
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
probably
by
bringing
that
exponent
down
,
so
i
believe
you
can
do
natural
log
to
both
sides
to
get
rid
of
e
on
both
sides
and
the
equation
would
look
like
:
x
ln
(
4x
)
=
3x
ln
(
x
)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
since
natural
log
is
base
e
,
you
can
use
that
to
cancel
out
the
e
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
once
u
do
that
,
u
can
solve
it
normally
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Let
me
try
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Thanks
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
go
for
it
,
lmk
how
it
goes
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
used
the
remaining
brain
cells
for
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Asked
for
a
few
steps
but
it
seems
easier
now

a
day
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
wanna
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
,
actually
nothing
too
crazy
,
but
i
had
like
an
"
in
class
assignment
"
(
aka
quiz
)
but
it
was
open
notes
and
we
could
talk
together
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
was
for
my
algorthms
class
,
which
is
just
all
math
stuff
and
its
pretty
difficult
stuff
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
my
friends
and
i
all
huddled
in
the
front
corner
of
the
room
,
got
our
tables
and
formed
a
circle
together
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
we
all
worked
on
the
same
problems
together
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
much
so
,
that
we
were
1
of
2
groups
that
actually
finished
the
thing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
awwwwww
lilke
little
penguin
huddle
cute
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
our
class
was
huge
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
we
have
like
50
people
in
our
class
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
only
about
i
'
d
say
15
people
turned
it
in
,
including
my
group
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
,
damn
they
are
fr
testing
your
knowledge
for
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
nuts

made
good
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
they
are
so
smart
,
and
we
just
think
off
each
other
and
solve
problems
so
fluently
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
especially
when
you
are
working
together
,
you
need
to
make
sure
you
have
people
that
also
put
in
the
work
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
we

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
for
this
one
problem
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
ngl
,
none
of
us
would
'
ve
gotten
it
if
it
was
on
a
quiz
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
we
pieced
it
together
one
by
one
and
it
took
about
25
minutes
to
solve
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
❤
️
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
was
like
the
avengers
assembled
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
today
i

,
that
'
s
the

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
that
'
s
a
good
feeling
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
sometimes
yea
it
feels
good
to
be
challenged
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
say
this
because
my
english
class
,
and
2
of
my
cs
professors
are
drop
dead
easy
so
the
semester
has
been
kind
of
boring
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
'
m
thankful
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

just
wish

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
this
is
a
good
start
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
omg
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
in
office
hours
today
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
sitting
in
front
of
this
one
indian
dude
(
not
the
one
that
I
see
everywhere
)
and
I
have
seen
him
in
every
office
hours
and
we
were
just
discussing
math
today
for
a
little
and
I
was
helping
him
and
then
he
went
do
you
want
to
study
tonight
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
hear
me
out
,
I
said
no
because
dude
said
he
wanted
to
study
from
10
:
00
-
12
:
00
am
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
💀
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
nah
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
like
later
on
I
was
like
I
dont
think
i
can
make
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
I
was
listening
to
music
at
the
same
time
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
then
5
min
later
he
was
like
you
got
a
phone
number
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
thw
way
I
said
no
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
damn
better
than
me
,
it
took
me
to
confess
my
love
and
then
i
asked
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
He
looked
at
me
all
confused
like
and
went
"
you
dont
have
like
a
phone
number
?"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
then
I
realized
i
just
told
the
guy
that
I
dont
have
a
phone
number
at
all
,
and
then
I
just
said
,
i
dont
give
away
numbers
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
i
gave
him
my
insta
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
ah
okay
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
it
was
so
werid
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
no
that
'
s
pretty
weird
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
my
friend
told
me
that
he
likes
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yup
that
sounds
about
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
call
me
whenever
he
tries
again
,
i
'
ll
give
him
the
death
stare
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
The
way
me
and
my
friend
laughed
about
how
i
said
no
,
back
to
lecture
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
he
texted
me
after
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
10
minutes
after
i
gave
him
my
insta
,
he
left
office
hours
and
messaged
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
ooooooooooooooooo
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
what
did
you
say
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
froze
for
a
good
5
seconds
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
told
her
like
we
talked
a
little
through
insta
over
the
summer
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
she
paused
and
just
went
mhm
ok
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
my
god
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hey
love
before
you
say
anything
,
i
swear
to
you
i
haven
'
t
said
anything
to
her
or
anyone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
said
namaste
in
the
teej
and
left
it
at
that
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
she
went
like
oh
he
posts
pictures
or
something
,
and
i
went
like
small
stories
sometimes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
she
just
went
i
see
and
went
mhm
,
and
then
proceeded
to
saying
,
"
anyways
good
night
and
study
well
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
so
random
,
my
hands
were
like
shaking
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
trust
you
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
pretty
sure
she
did
not
start
thinking
we
were
dating
just
because
you
said
namaste
and
smiled
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
i
am
sure
she
knows
nothing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
got
my
heart
racing
i
'
m
ngl
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
is
really
random
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
it
was
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
the
fact
the
she
didnt
have
a
follow
up
question
got
me
thinking
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
about
to
explode
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
what
do
you
think
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
that
usually
means
she
is
thinking
of
something
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
she
probably
likes
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
now
if
my
dad
and
brother
start
asking
,
idk
that
would
make
me
think
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
mom
is
fine
,
she
probably
just
saw
how
cute
and
nice
you
were
at
kreepa
'
s
party
and
the
teej
party
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
gotta
be
the
best
to
show
the
best
😤
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
are
the
best
love
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
is
quite
interesting
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
huh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you
dont
even
have
to
worry
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
ur
the
best
trust
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
because
we
went
from
talking
about
turf
to
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
it
was
an
instant
random
question
"
do
you
talk
to
sanskar
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
seems
like
she
'
s
been
meaning
to
ask
you
,
just
didn
'
t
know
how
so
she
got
impatient
?
or
just
general
curiosity
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
either
way
,
if
they
'
re
thinking
about
you
talking
to
me
,
good
sign
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Perhaps
,
maybe
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
now
let
'
s
continue
our
fake
convos
a
little
more
through
organic
memes
or
something
like
that
,
and
make
a
reputable
conversation
and
degree
of
friendship
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
NO
fr
,
usually
if
i
tell
her
i
am
talking
to
a
friend
over
chat
and
it
was
a
dude
she
used
to
be
like
"
who
is
it
"
"
why
",
and
when
i
told
her
i
talked
to
you
for
a
little
she
just
went
mhm
ok
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
told
me
good
night
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
was
like
expecting
a
"
dont
fall
in
love
lecture
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
'
ve
gotten
that
before
when
talking
to
guys
?
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
hahaha
that
'
s
hilarious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
this
is
why
insta
needs
to
stay
neutral
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
cant
show
discord
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
cant
show
number
because
you
asked
on
discord
,
connections
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
insta
it
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
but
we
should
build
more
of
a
conversation
repertoire
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
because
brother
knows
we
talked
on
insta
before
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
its
believable
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
we
got
months
love
dw
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
like
here
'
s
my
thinking
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
we
will
dedicate
a
week
before
to
make
it
like
we
have
not
been
talking
to
each
other
everyday
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
if
i
show
a
little
more
interest
in
our
insta
chats
over
time
,
like
maybe
once
a
week
or
once
every
two
weeks
,
it
can
get
them
thinking
if
they
ask
again
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
can
'
t
talk
too
much
otherwise
its
obvious
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
can
'
t
talk
too
little
or
the
idea
is
fading
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
gotta
keep
it
just
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
its
okay
,
sometimes
out
of
the
blue
ask
how
life
is
at
random
and
i
will
do
the
same
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
most
organic
way
is
if
u
post
a
story
,
or
if
i
do
,
we
can
reply
to
it
and
have
a
short
convo
and
go
from
there
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
way
it
doesn
'
t
seem
so
random
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
no
yea
thats
what
imma
do
now
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
same
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
keeps
interest
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
again
not
too
often
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
just
enough
so
that
its
a
silent
factor
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
that
way
if
they
ever
go
,
so
what
do
you
talk
about
i
can
be
like
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
random
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
nothing
too
deep
yk
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
if
they
ever
ask
to
see
our
chat
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
u
can
show
them
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
can
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
it
'
ll
be
an
indicator
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
not
that
we
'
re
dating
,
but
we
are
talking
like
friends
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
it
'
ll
get
them
into
the
idea
of
us
being
together
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
can
snowball
into
bigger
things
for
us
later
down
the
road
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Dont
worry
,
my
mom
likes
you
as
a
person
,
i
can
already
tell
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
yea
keep
it
formal
so
they
can
be
like
,
"
you
talk
about
anything
else
"
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
great
news
,
now
i
just
gotta
become
the
best
so
they
consider
me
to
the
highest
degree
over
all
other
guys
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
ll
put
my
formal
texting
on
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

a
very
different
way
with
people
i
don
'
t
know
or
don
'
t
talk
to
very
often
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Trust
me
,
they
probably
already
think
you
are
the
best
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
heard
them
talking
about
you
and
me

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
gotta
be
better
than
best
😤
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

and
i
walked
in
and
they
smiled
and
stopped
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
already
are

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
gotta
keep
it
going
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
subtle
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
effective
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
really
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
hey

earlier
today
when

that
i
was
in
class
and
u
said
ttyl
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
was
gonna
reply
back
to
u
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
was
sitting
right
next
to
my
friend
,
and
i
noticed
from
my
peripheral
vision
he
was
just
LASERING
my
phone
screen
,
and
i
pulled
away
so
fast
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
he
was
like
,
who
u
talking
to
?
i
was
like
dw
about
it
,
and
he
was
like
yeah
honestly
i
just
saw
discord
and
something
red
,
but
i
didn
'
t
see
anything
dw
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
heart
was
about
to
explode
,
i
was
like
holy
shit
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
not
like
he
'
s
close
to
my
family
or
anything
at
all
,
but
that
was
the
closest
anyone

sometimes
when
you

so
long
to
message
you
and
i
just
start
with
hey
how
was
your
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
because
i
keep
on
thinking
that
sometimes
you
will
be
eating
dinner
with
your
family
with
the
phone
on
the
table
,
and
when
you
go
help
or
put
dishes
in
the
sink
someone
gonna
be
like
,
so
hmm
you
do
talk
to
her
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
why
i
try
not
to
start
with
hey
love
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
since
you
have
notifications
on

my
phone
out
in
the
open
,
its
always
locked
and
it
requires
faceID
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
rarely
ever
leave
my
phone
out
of
my
sight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
very
rare
that
i
leave
it
out
of
my
pocket
somewhere
my
family
can
access
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhh

or
something
and
my
name
pops
up
saying

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
idk
i
have
imagined
that
happening
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
is
probably
more
likely
to
happening
,
but
if
im
outside
somewhere
,
and
there
'
s
a
chance
for
u
to
msg
me
,
i
preemptively
turn
on
DND
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
on
my
phone
,
not
discord
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

I
was
like
"
a
few

I

find

going
through
the
same
mental
and
depressing
state
as
i

[sskarz]
i
think
we

i
think
our

some
level
at
that
point
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
whether
we
tell
them
or
not
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
we
will

even
if
we
dont
tell
them
,
after
i
get
a
degree
,
I
can
tell
them
I
am
going
somewhere
and
they
will
be
fine

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
The
only
reason
I

is
because
it
would
give
peace
of
mind
,
and
also
give
us
a
lot
more
freedom
yk
?
Idk
if
I
can
do
6
straight
years
of
having
to
sneak
you
around
with
me
and
doing
that
,
in
6
years
that
’
s
going
wrong
somewhere
somehow
eventually
and
being
found
out
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
That
’
s
what
I
’
m
concerned
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
completely
understand
,
trust
me
I
dont
want
to
have
to
sneak
around
either
,
and
I
will
definitely
think
about
it
.
I
just
dont
want
them
to
be
like
,
you
are
too
young
for
this
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
you
know
even
if
they
like
the
idea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No

I

,
don

t
worry
I

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
sanskar

I

so
that
we
can
be
more
comfortable

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

And
I

pressure
you

So
for
sociology
,
he
assigned
a
5
-
7
page
paper
,
which
is
a
later
problem
.
For
Philosophy
,
it
went
well
,
we
had
2
definitions
of
100
or
more
words
and
then
2
essays
from
300
-
500
words
.
I
am
telling
you
it
was
not
enough
time
,
but
I
wrote
what
i
needed
and
it
was
good
.
Um
then
after
that
class
ended
i
took
15
min
to
eat
lunch
and
then
ran
across
campus
to
the
math
office
hours
from
1
-
3
,
then
forgot
I
had
math
discussions
at
3
:
30
,
so
I
went
there
.
After
that
was
done
,
I
went
to
history
,
which
was
a
movie
,
but
it
was
dark
in
there
and
I
only
got
a
little
bit
of
math
done
in
there
.
After
that
I
had
dinner
and
came
back
and
did
the
sociology
quiz
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Roommates
are
gone
,
and
I
am
alone
.

I

like
I

breakfast
person
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
during

all
opens
at
11
:
00
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhh
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

person
either
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Coffee

my
go
to
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I

I

[prabipyakurel]
Didn
’
t

the
morning
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So

a
few
breakfast
snacks
and

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
From

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh

s
pretty
smart
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
during
orientation
it
was
in
paper
plates
,
so
I
used
to
get
breakfast
and
bring
it
up
and
eat
it
here
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ohhhh
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
But
like
I
felt
sick
with
literally
everything
,
the
food
,
the
weather
and
Covid
speeding
the
first
week
so
I
just
stopped
the
breakfast
thing
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No

that
week
,
it

a
pretty
rough
start
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But

week
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
also
missing
family

lot
[prabipyakurel]

And

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
but
like
when
I
first
opened
your
story
,
the
monitor
screen
was
different
and
then
I
saw
it
again
and
it
was
another
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

I

the
page
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
opened
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
my
like

not
send
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
changed
it
because
i
wanted
to
put
some
code
on
the
screen
and
make
it
actually
look
like
a
workflow
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
i
closed
everything
before
the
picture
,
so
i
opened
everything
back
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
so
i
thought
it
was
on
my
end
,
and
then
came
upstairs
and
it
was
different
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
thought
there
was
something
wrong
with
me
rn

for

,
almost
done
summarizing
all
of
my
documents
.
I
studied
some

ran
out
of
things
to
do
.
And
I
eventually
got
so
bored
that
I
went
to
go
check
out
the
frozen
yogurt
place
and
it
was
awesome
.
I
am
currently
still
continuing
some
more
work
and
eating
this
packaged
butter
chicken
rice
thing
that
takstes
like
tomato
sauce
and
rice
.

How
was
your
day
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
um
,
quite
productive
actually
even
on
just
4
hours
of
sleep
which
is
wild
.
started
the
day
off
in
the
study
room
and
finished
my
lab
which
wasn
'
t
that
bad
.
And
then
i
played
with
my
buddies
for
about
2
hours
then
i
got
back
to
working
on
my
laptop
and
organizing
my
workflow
for
classes
tomorrow
.
After
that
,
I
went
to
the
gym
and
had
a
good
workout
despite
me
absolutely
not
wanting
to
go
😂,
gotta
do
what
you
gotta
do
!
Finally
,
I
went
by
Marshalls
to
see
if
I
could
get
another
water
bottle
since
I
lost
the
other
one
last
week
,
and
there
was
no
small
thermoflask
type
bottle
so
I
'
m
just
gonna
get
one
tomorrow
at
the
book
store
.
Came
home
,
took
a
shower
,
and
then
I
started
organizing
my
entire
room
because
I
realized
that
EVERYTHING
was
out
of
order
,
so
just
been
trying
to
organize
stuff
and
not
have
a
giant
hidden
mess
😅
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
about
it
tho
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
got
some
baked
hot
cheetos
that
i
got
from
sams
club
since
they
'
re
lower
in
calories
,
and
just
been
munching
on
that
as
a
late
night
snack
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
said
nah

[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

I
think
about
how
I
used
to
wear
glasses
,
I
'
m
so
used
to
not
having
any
glasses
anymore
I
forgot

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

them
the
day
I
had
my
surgery
and
threw
them
away
,
which
I
was
kinda
mad
about
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
it
is
what
it
is
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
still
have
my
other
glasses
,
including
my
first
ever
pair
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
s
not
getting
rid
of
any
of
those
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

'
s
a
reminder
of
who
I
was
and
how
I
became
who
I

today

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

so
in
case
it
breaks
its
not
my
actual
one
with
better
perscription
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
only
started
in
8th
grade
but
it
feels
nice
to
keep
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hey
just
letting
you
know
,
if
you
wear
the
wrong
prescription
for
an
extended
period
of
time
,
it
can
mess
up
your
eyes
even
more
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
thats
why
i
dont
anymore
[prabipyakurel]

i
knew
my
eye
sight

getting
worse

worse
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
if
they
didnt
do
that
random
eye
exam
in
7th
grade
and
the
report
wasnt
send
to
my
parents
I
would
have
probably
not
gotten
them
till
later
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
It
was
getting
a
little
blurry
near
the
end
of
7th
grade
but
i
never
told
them
,

even
the
doctor
was
surprised
when
she
told
me
to

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
love
you
sooooooo
much
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
I
'
m
trying
out
this
new
planner
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
'
m
literally
trying
to
organize
my
entire
life
rn
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
lmao
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
and
since
I
'
m
fully
into
the
apple
ecosystem
,
I
thought
it
'
d
be
easier
to
just
sync
everything
across
devices
and
make
my
life
easier
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
planner
is
fun
,
as
long
as
you
keep
up
with
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
I
got
this
planner
called
Structure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ohh
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
think
it
looks
so
aesthetically
pleasing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
just
super
minimalist
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
do
keep
up
with
one
,
but
it
was
a
little
outdated
so
I
'
m
switching
my
systems
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
to
some
more
modern
solutions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
no
that
looks
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
the
black
background
and
not
too
many
words
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
just
realized
I
marked
the
wrong
times
for
my
events
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
let
me
fix
this
up
hold
on
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ah

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
sorry
lol
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
I
'
m
a
sucker
for
minimalist
setups
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
your
loser
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

the
times

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Instead

my
email
of

the
junk
and
got
rid
of
all
the
unneccessary
email
subscriptions
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

months
,
maybe

,
i
'
ve
gotten
so
much
email
that

unneccessary
and
i
realized
it

me
check
my
email
for
anything
important
way
less
often
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
i
had

[prabipyakurel]
Some

Do
you
usually
use
a
digital
planner
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
'
m
a
compsci
student
and
tech
lover
,
so
im
pushing
for
all
my
workflow
to
be
digitalized
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
’
m
here
writing
everything
down
on
a
dry
erase
board
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
especially
being
in
this
apple
ecosystem
,
i
'
m
trying
to
transfer
my
old
android
workflow
to
an
apple
workflow
so
that
'
s
why
it
'
s
taking
me
a
while
to
do
all
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
whatever
works
for
you
love
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ohhhh
I
see
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
know
people
that
rather
just
do
everything
with
physical
notebooks
and
white
boards
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
I
do
the
white
board
and
the
reminder
app
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
personally
,
i
much
prefer
having
my
stuff
sync
across
multiple
devices
so
i
can
bring
my
workflow
with
me
anywhere
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
this
one
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
good
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
no
you
are
a
busy
person
,
you
need
it

that
,
that
’
s

.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Gracias

the
only

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Ngl
I

I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
it
’
s
not
for
me
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
its
not
for
everyone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
it
helps
me
because
my
phone
is
the
first
thing
i
use
when
i
wake
up
,
and
my
planner
would
let
me
know
what
part
of
the
day
im
at
and
what
i
need
to
take
care
of
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

,
Saturdays
,
Sundays
[sskarz]

11
means
i
need
to
wake
up
around
6
and
go
at
that
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
people
that
have
work
at
8
are
usually
there
,
which
means
its
packed
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
i
can
'
t
wake
up
that
early
consistently
usually
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

don
'
t

,
5
days
a

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I
found
out
that
this
new
Notes
app
I
'
m
using
is
actually
amazing
!
As
I
write
down
my
notes
,
I
can
record
the
entire
lecture
and
that
recording
sticks
to
my
notes
for
that
day
specifically
,
and
it
'
s
like
my
notes
start
writing
themselves
as
the
recording
is
playing
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
some
incredible
stuff
,
never
seen
this
before
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh

’
s

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And

too
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

,
so
I
recorded
my
last
lecture
for
today
and
it
wasn
'
t
even
a
big
file
size
,
it
'
s
stored
right
into
iCloud
and
it
'
s
only
attached
to
that
note
page
specifically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
I
can
hear
the
lecture
guy
so
clearly
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

everyday

How

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
love
,
my
day
has
been
okay
.
I
got
up
and
check
my
midterm
grade
and
surprisingly
I
didn
’
t
fail
,
got
83
/
00
.
I
also
got
full
score
for
my
sociology
quiz
.
Then
I
attended
my
2
classes
and
found
out
that
for
my
philosophy
midterm
,
he
will
take
the
strongest
one
and
grade
it
so
I
am
praying
.
Then
I
ended
the
day
by
going
to
history
and
finishing
half
the
move
from
last
Thursday
.
I
also
went
to
go
eat
dinner
,
but
I
didn
’
t
like
anything
and
didn
’
t
really
feel
like
eating
it
so
I
had
a
few
onion
rings
and
pumpkin
pie
.
Now
I
am
sitting
and
not
doing
anything
,
and
looking
for
what
needs
to
be
done
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

midterm

raw
score

rounded
up
one

[sskarz]
But
I

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
just
wanted
to
calm
down
after
dinner
,
and
now
I
am
looking
for
something
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
2
papers
i
can
start
on
,
but
i
know
i
need
a
good
few
hours
once
i
start
working
on
it
so
cant
do
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
um
got
through
the
math
i
can
do
on
my
own
,
and
saving
the
rest
for
office
hours
tomorrow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
um
i
would
finalize
my
schedule
but
i
still
need
to
work
on
the
time
stuff
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
dont
know
what
to
do
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Hmmmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
im
bored
,
but
i
can
do
something
rn
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
it
’
s
pretty
late
to
start
anything
rn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Are
u
that
type
where
if
u
start
something
new
u
try
and
finish
it
in
that
session
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
as
much
as
i
can
'
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Mhmmm
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
once
i
go
,
i
will
keep
going
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
rn
if
u
started
on
one
of
the
papers
,
you
would
probably
stay
up
all
night
to
get
it
done
tonight
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
would
stay
up
and
go
until
i
run
out
of
information
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
see
,
yeah
honestly
u
have
tomorrow
morning
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
U
can
start
then
since
u
have
time
leeway
that
’
s
not
cutting
into
your
sleeping
time
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
for
sociology
i
need
books
and
can
only
use
what
i
have
gathered
from
the
previous
morning
,
and
for
history
,
I
need
to
review
the
files
and
find
out
where
each
document
is
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
mean
,
I
can
stay
up
,
i
dont
have
anything
early
tomorrow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
know
but
yk
you
should
at
least
try
and
get
some
good
sleep
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Goes
a
long
way
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
know
love
I
know
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
know
u
know
,
just
reminding
u
:)
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
But
if
you
think
you
can
and

it
’
s
worth
it
,
then
go
for
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
at

I

create
an
outline
perhaps
[prabipyakurel]

and
sociology
on

[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

his
presidency
,
because
if

[prabipyakurel]

How
long
does
the
paper
have
to
be
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
also
,
do
they
not
allow
u
to
use
online
resources
like
the
entire
web
,
just
books
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
5
-
7
double
spaced
,
preferred
books
and
not
random
websites
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
they
have
to
be
like
i
think
he
said
no
biases
and
focusing
on
a
specific
arguments
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Ah
so
an
objective
overview
of
events
basically
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
So
like
I
’
m
assuming
ur
gonna
use
books
to
cite
as
sources
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
basically
have
to
mention
the
event
,
what
happened
,
and
how
it
contributes
to
development
using
lecture
and
books
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
yep
gonna
sit
on
the
library
floor
between
the
shelves
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
how
do
u
know
what
book
to
look
for
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Like
is
there
a
section
on
George
Washington
biographies
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
search
it
up
on
the
university
library
website
,
it
tells
me
which
floor
and
what
section
number
its
located
in
and
i
go
find
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
am
pretty
sure
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Like
a
title
of
a
book
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
yea
or
just
like
the
general
idea
of
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
so
i
type
on
indonesia
or
indonesian
history
and
it
shows
me
options
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
i
pick
some
record
the
number
and
which
library
it
is
in
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
and
then
go
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
WAIT
HOLD
ON
THE
ROOMBA
CAME
IN
MY
ROOM
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

destroyed
3
of
my
wires
so
far
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
one
time
it
got
stuck
under
my
bed
and
it
just
died
there
,
so
throughout
one
of
my
days
I
would
just
hear
it
say
ERROR
and
it
would
scare
the
shit
out
of
me
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
It

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

thing
do
its
job
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
its
your
responsibility
to
move
stuff
when
its
cleaning
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
But
the
problem

all
my
wires
up

charging
cables

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Hey
hey
,
my
day
was
good
,
I
started
off
this
morning
got
a
little
bit
of
everything
done
.
Then
after
lunch
I
went
to
math
office
hours
and
cleared
up
my
confusion
about
certain
topics
.
But
like
today
idk
after
like
30
mins
in
there
I
felt
really
drowsy
and
needed
to
put
my
head
down
for
a
little
,
and
i
usually
stay
the
full
office
hours
and
go
straight
to
math
from
there
,
but
I
couldnt
today
and
came
down
to
the
library
for
a
short
15
min
nap
before
my
math
lecture
.
Then
after
I
got
back
,
i
still
felt
like
so
sleepy
and
all
,
it
has
never
happened
before
and
i
slept
from
like
5
-
6
and
went
for
dinner
,
which
was
decent
.
And
I
have
been
working
on
the
preparation
for
my
history
essay
and
am
taking
notes
on
the
document
that
I
need
to
write
about
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How
about
you
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

ever
apologize

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
day
has
been
going
pretty
well
,
english
was
boring
as
usual
,
lunch
was
great
but
made
me
sleepy
too
,
lots
of
math
today
and
then
a
boring
class
to
end
off
on
.
Found
out
there
was
like
this
studyathon
at
a
room
so
my
friends
and
I
went
there
and
chilled
out
,
they
had
free
food
and
coffee
which
i
so
desperately
needed
.
Didn
'
t
do
much
studying
tho
,
just
talked
about
classes
and
stuff
with
my
friends
i
haven
'
t
seen
in
a
while
.
It
was
pretty
good
,
then
afterwards
i
walked
to
where
i
usually
parked
,
except
i
didn
'
t
park
there
for
that
time
,
so
i
walked
across
campus
like
twice
because
im
dumb
.
Came
home
then
got
some
work
from
my
dad
to
do
,

to
put
my
head
down
before

[prabipyakurel]
And

for

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
I

had
a
really
wacky
dream
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
wbu
love
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
dw
I
slept
well
,
i
had
no
dream
,
woke
straight
in
the
morning
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
what
was
it
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
This
dream
was
like
super
vivid
idk
why
.
So
it
was
like
I
was
part
of
this
horror
maze
with
some
friends
,
and
I
was
in
the
lead
of
everyone
.
And
so
everyone
was
having
trouble
navigating
but
I
just
went
ahead
and
I
lost
them
by
going
too
far
,
and
I
found
this
door
that
had
a
label
called
"
Secret
"
with
like
that
classic
blood
horror
type
lettering
.
I
went
inside
and
it
was
just
like
a
room
that
looked
like
a
regular
old
apartment
,
with
like
a
kitchen
and
dinner
table
and
everything
.
It
looked
super
normal
,
till
I
kept
going
in
the
room
where
I
noticed
things
started
repeating
itself
like
the
dining
room
would
repeat
itself
as
I
kept
moving
into
the
room
,
and
the
kitchen
would
start
duplicating
itself
as
I
kept
moving
.
So
much
so
that
there
were
5
identical
fridges
,
and
I
checked
in
each
of
them
and
they
were
all
the
same
.
I
know
,
but
it
gets
weirder
.
As
I
checked
the
last
fridge
,
I
heard
a
random
ass
noise
.
Now
I
hadn
'
t
heard
anything
till
then
,
and
so
I
looked
at
the
fridge
with
a
closer
eye
and
noticed
there
was
like
a
small
dog
in
a
cage
at
the
bottom
of
the
freezer
in
the
fridge
.
So
I
picked
up
the
dog
in
the
cage
and
I
was
like
wtf
,
so
I
went
to
go
back
to
where
I
came
from
,
and
for
some
reason
there
'
s
just
a
bunch
of
the
same
dogs
,
but
not
in
cages
,
all
in
a
pile
.
And
they
all
just
stared
at
me
,
and
the
one
I
had
started
growling
at
me
,
so
I
threw
it
at
the
other
dogs
and
ran
for
my
life
to
the
door
where
I
came
from
.
And
then
a
dog
got
on
my
leg
and
started
biting
me
and
wouldn
'
t
let
go
,
but
I
punted
it
and
then
I
shut
the
door
behind
me
.
I
just
kept
running
and
then
I
woke
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
You
know
,
people
say
there
are
meanings
behind
every
dream
,
idk
about
that
one
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
that
is
certainly
weird
,
and
dog
biting
is
kinda
scary
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
but
you
will
be
fine
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
no
yeah
,
i
know
what
the
dog
looks
like
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
just
don
'
t
know
the
breed
name
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
but
its
like
a
small
white
dog
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ohhh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

THIS
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
EXCEPT

ALL
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
AND
THEY
ALL
BARED

TEETH
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ugh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
just
imagine
like
a
thousand
of
these
little
shits
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
they
all
started
chasing
me
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
what
the
hell
were
you
thinking
picking
up
one
of
them
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
would
have
ran
the
instant
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
well
why
is
there
a
dog
in
a
cage
at
the
bottom
of
a
freezer
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

your
friends
behind

a
dream
,
and

into
a
door
that
says

[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
you

resting
rn
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
,
just
in

for
background
noise
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
mhm

nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
sorting
out
my
financials
as
this
new
laptop
costs
even
more
😭
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
oh
no
,
you
will
be
fine
love
dw
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
i
mean
yeah
its
just
i
hate
seeing
the
number
go
down
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
literally
like
i
was
trying
to
put
up
a
workload
that
i
'
m
doing
for
a
project
,
and
it
almost
ran
out
of
RAM
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
at
16
gigs
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
just
not
enough
anymore
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
I
went
with
a
higher
end
model
with
32
gigs
of
RAM
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
now
that
i
'
m
saying
this
,
i
forgot
to
ask
,
do
u
know
what
RAM
is
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
i
have
an
idea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
its
like
just
how
much
the
computer
can
hold
and
stuff
right
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
i
might
be
wrong
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
like
how
much
storage
perhaps
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
you
'
re
kinda
right
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
ish
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
think
of
it
like
this
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
your
RAM
is
your
short
term
memory
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
stuff
like
getting
groceries
and
then
forgetting
about
it
10
years
down
the
road
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
yk
what
I
mean
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
like
its
easy
to
remember
,
and
easy
to
forget
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
your
storage
like
how
much
stuff
you
can
store
in
your
computer
,
your
long
term
memory
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
ohhhh
yea
that
makes
sense
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
so
my
computer
was
like
,
there
are
too
many
groceries
to
pick
up
from
too
many
places
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
so
im
giving
it
extra
neurons
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
man
this
analogy
sucks
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]

talked
to
the

and
he
was
like
telling
me
all
these
things
and
then
it
liked
zoomed
all
out
and
then
I
saw
that
entire
conversation
in
a
YouTube
video
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Having
some
weird
inception
levels
of
dreams
lol
[sskarz]

My
day
has
been
normal
,
I
got
some
more
of
both
essays
done
in
the
morning
,
went
to
math
office
hours
and
reviewed
some
math
concepts
,
and
attended
my
math
lecture
where
he
moved
way
to
fast
.
Then
got
back
and
ate
some
chow
mein
that
I
had
saved
from
yesterday
.
I
got
started
and
finished
half
my
math
hw
,
and
then
went
to
eat
dinner
.
After
dinner
,
I
got
another
paragraph
of
the
history
essay
done
,
and
now
I
am
thinking
if
I
should
just
call
it
a
day
or
get
more
done
for
the
sociology
one
(
i
have
like
2
weeks
till
its
due
).
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
currently
just
listening
to
music
and
thinking
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
How

you

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

on
the
sociology
paper
and
it
’
s
already
kind
of
late
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

get
too
bored
and
start
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
’
s
been
quite
the
day
,
a
long
one
really
.
I
started
off
by
waking
up
late
at
like
8
and
then
went
to
UPS
to
get
a
box
to
return
my
laptop
.
Then
got
my
sister
some
Starbucks
for
the
morning
since
she
didn
’
t
have
work
,
and
then
went
to
class
.
Boring
as
usual
,
but
then
I
got
a
text
saying
that
my
laptop
came
early
and
that
I
could
go
pick
it
up
so
I
did
.
Got
it
,
then
got
some
really
good
lunch
,
then
headed
back
to
my
next
class
.
It
was
okay
,
content
was
heavy
and
the
lecture
was
recorded
so
I
’
m
gonna
go
back
and
watch
that
later
this
week
.
The
next
class
after
was
boring
,
got
a
midterm
in
2
weeks
for
that
class
so
yippeee
.
Then
my
final
class
,
got
a
big
assignment
due
this
coming
Sunday
,
and
another
mention
of
a
midterm
coming
soon
.
Then
I
talked
with
some
of
my
friends
and
then
headed
home
.
And
now
I
’
m
here
,
family
went
out
to
Cheesecake
Factory
and
they
said
they
’
re
bringing
some
food
back
so
I
’
m
waiting
for
that
.
That
’
s
all
!
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[sskarz]
[sskarz]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]

I

into
a
hermit
for
the
next
2
weeks
and
just
study
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
👍
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Uh
,
more
like
I
knew
them
,
we
’
re
friends
for
8th
grade
,
then
completely
dropped
when
we
went
to
highschool
.
They
went
to
SG
so
yeah
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
will
do
awesome
,
remember
to
take
breaks
in
between
as
always
and
rest
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Their
name
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Idk
if
u
know
her
,
but
she
goes
by
Audrey
Yu
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
name
is
too
common
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
dont
know
her
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
She
was
friends
with
a
group
of
people
I
didn
’
t
really
hangout
with
,
so
we
didn
’
t
keep
in
contact
in
high
school
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
then
I
just
got
a
random
follow
,
then
a
message
on
my
story
about
my
new
laptop
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhh
nice
nice
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
thats
good
tho
,
they
probably
wanted
to
catch
up
with
you
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
guess
..?
I
’
m
gonna
be
straight
honest
with
you
,
I
don
’
t
really
like
to
continue
friendships
after
years
of
not
talking
at
all
,
especially
if
I
had
no
desire
to
stay
friends
even
after
drifting
apart
yk
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
it
all
seems
so
sudden
,
and
i
don
'
t
like
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
I
get
that
feeling
,
it
happens
.
Yea
if
you
dont
feel
confortable
love
,
its
okay
.
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
,
so
I
left
her
on

[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I
could
'
ve
bought
a
lottery
ticket
that
day
and
probably
won
the
lotto
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
You
are
so
adorableeeeeeeeeee
,
maybe
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Try

day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
for
sure
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
omg
is
it
just
my
parents
,
or
like
once
a
year
,
my
parents
will
get
super
excited
and
will
just
buy
a
single
lotto
ticket
,
and
then
inevitably
either
get
nothing
or
scream
that
they
got
$
5
back
and
then
it
repeats
the
next
year
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
My
god
,
I
thought
that
was
only
my
parents
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
get
overly
excited
for
like
a
week
in
the
entire
year
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
after
that
they
just
don
’
t
care
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
hahaha
omg
nepali
parents
are
all
just
the
same
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
omg
yeah
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
its
like
nothing
happened
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Yea
and
the
most
is
like
oh
wow
“
2
dollars
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
And
when
they
don
’
t
win
anything
they
always
go
,
just
so
close
,
I
was
so
close
to
those
numbers
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
OMG
YEAH
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
my
mom
got
so
sad
one
day
,
she
actually
got
somewhat
close
to
the
jackpot
by
a
couple
numbers
and
then
she
got
like
nothing
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
It
happens
and
I
am
there
just
like
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Yes
I
think
everyone
gets
close
to
the
numbers
but
doesn
’
t
get
the
exact
number
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
be
like
“
it
’
s
why
it
’
s
a
lottery
”
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yup
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]

makes
a
sad
face
and

[prabipyakurel]
Yea
never
gave
those
things
a
thought
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
feel
like
if
something
good
has
to
happen

naturally
just

[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I

[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Omg

found
out
that
in
the
math
building
in
the
classroom
the
chairs
have
wheels
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Idk

chairs
with
wheels
mhmmm
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
what
about
them
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Shut
the
hell
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Like
these
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
They
looks
so
cool
,
now
I
wanna
a
class
with
these
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
i
have
these
in
like
every
classroom
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Bruh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
they
are
pretty
nice
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
have
any
classroom
classes
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
😭
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
imagineeee
,
that
'
s
all
i
have
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Ahhhhhh
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
always
walk
past
classrooms
and
go
,
damn
,
I
wanna
sit
and
swivel
around
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
no
I
get
a
lecture
hall
where
I
barely
have
enough
space
to
stretch
my
arms
properly
without
knowing
someone
in
the
face
with
my
elbow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
wow
its
that
packed
always
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Well
for
math
,
the
place
I
sit
yes
because
I
sit
in
the
front
,
and
for
my
other
lectures
yes
the
seats
are
pretty
close
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Occasionally
there
are
empty
seats
next
to
me
but
only
on
one
side
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
oh
damn
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
i
guess
that
makes
sense
,
you
guys
have
so
many
students
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
for
a
single
class
it
has
to
be
a
huge
lecture
hall
just
to
fit
everyone
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
No
yea
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
350
students
for
math
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
was
dying
when
he
said
that
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
holy
shit
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
u
gotta
send
me
a
pic
of
that
lecture
hall
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
insane
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
one
day
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
my
lecture
has
350
and
the
next
math
lecture
,
same
subject
different
group
,
also
has
about
300
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
that
'
s
crazy
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
and
im
out
here
with
max
class
size
of
50
💀
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Nah
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
will
take
a
pic
of
all
my
lecture
halls
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
are
spaced
out
better
then
others
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Some
have
a
better
writing
surface
while
some
are
worse
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
that
makes
sense
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
do
you
prefer
classrooms
like
high
school
or
lecture
halls
?
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
my
math
discussion
probably
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Personally
high
school
style
but
this
is
fine
too
it
works
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
I
don
’
t
completely
hate
it
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
yeah
you
probably
have
to
just
get
used
to

Um
I
got
really
scared
around
like
4
-
5
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
So
basically
I
was
walking
to
the
dorm
apparently
past
like
7
,
and
these
group
of
boys
noticed
me
and
they
would
not
stop
chasing
me
,
there
was
no
one
else
on
the
streets
and
when
I
got
to
my
building
they
caught
up
to
me
and
then
I
woke
up
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Oh
my
god
that
’
s
terrifying
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
I
got
up
really
scared
and
like
for
a
second
wanted
to
just
cry
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
But
I
calmed
myself
down
,
listened
to
one
of
your
voice
messages
and
then
just
slept
again
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
❤
️
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No

’
t

for
a
little
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
I

’
ve

went
to
the
gym
early
in
the
morning
for
an
hour
,
but
i
had
to
stop
because
my
body
just
felt
so
weak
for
no
reason
,
and
then
when
i
walked
out
of
the
gym
,
everything
was
extraordinarily
bright
like
the
sun
had
crashed
on
me
,
and
then
i
drove
home
and
i
felt
way
too
weak
to
do
anything
for
some
reason
,
so
i
had
lunch
and
had
a
mid
day
nap
for
like
2
hours
.
Afterwards
,
I
felt
a
lot
better
.
Then
I
went
to
class
and
then
worked
on
some
homework
and
studying
.

my

with
sociology

then
went

after

I
went
to
office
hours

then
came
to
eat
lunch
real
fast
,
came
back
to
the
room
and
checked
for
assignments
and
revised
the
essay
.
After
that
I
had
a
zoom
math
session
from
3
:
30
-
5
:

I
left
the
meeting
10
mins
early
to
get
to
my
history
lecture
which
was
useful
.
I
got
more
info
for
my
essay
.
Pretty

after
that
I
had

have
been
working
on
editing
and
finding
essay
information
.

together

day

Sounds

So
my
first
dream
was
weird
,
well
the
other
one
was
weirder
but
here
we
go
.
I
was
wearing
a
suit
and
it
started
off
me
being
in
an
elevator
and
reaching
a
floor
,
and
it
was
this
fancy
room
with
gold
and
diamonds
and
stuff
,
and
a
table
where
there
was
a
guy
sitting
there
.
So
i
go
over
to
this
guy
and
apparently
i
also
had
body
guards
and
some
other
guys
with
me
,
and
when
I
approached
the
guy
near
the
table
,
he
sets
this
like
tech
device
and
tells
me
i
have
10
minutes
to
fiddle
with
it
,
and
then
i
have
to
tell
him
about
the
product
.
And
it
’
s
a
familiar
looking
product
,
but
also
not
at
all
.
It
looked
like
a
Nintendo
switch
but
it
was
like
of
the
future
?
So
the
guy
leaves
and
then
i
start
inspecting
the
thing
and
i
make
note
about
what
was
good
and
bad
about
it
for
literally
like
10
mins
.
It
felt
super
long
till
he
came
back
,
and
he
said
give
me
a
percent
score
,
i
said
60
%
and
everyone
was
shocked
and
the
guy
was
like
,
why
?
So
then
I
start
speaking
out
of
my
ass
like
I
know
any
of
this
weird
holographic
tech
stuff
and
he
nods
and
says
,
so
for
20
million
would
you
want
the
patent
?
I
say
yes
for
some
reason
,
then
we
shook
hands
and
then
the
dream
ended
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Damn
,
look
at
you
in
a
suit
with
bodyguards
and
all
😂
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
That
sounds
cool
tho
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
It
was
so
vivid
but
weird
idk
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Random
,
but
hey
maybe
that
will
be
you
in
the
future
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
And
then
i
woke
up
at
like
3
:
40
am
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
lol
idk
about
20
million
dollar
deals
but
we
will
see
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Also
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Sleep
graph
checks
out
,
i
had
3
REM
cycles
,
2
of
those
i
remember
weird
dreams
for
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Oh
wow
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
so
this
next
dream
was
just
like
…
what
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
So
it
starts
in
this
car
and
I
’
m
driving
with
some
of
my
friends
and
we
park
at
this
like
old
abandoned
house
.
We
were
gonna
setup
and
spend
the
night
here
for
some
reason
I
’
ve
got
no
clue
.
We
start
getting
setup
and
then
some
time
passes
.
Then
gunshots
start
happening
and
we
all
rush
down
and
start
shooting
them
back
?
I
was
confused
but
i
grabbed
the
nearest
gun
and
I
start
shooting
them
,
but
then
my
friend
gets
shot
and
then
he
literally
almost
dies
.
So
then
,
as
best
as
I
could
explain
it
,
time
reverses
and
the
dream
goes
back
to
the
beginning
of
when
we
were
parking
,
but
i
remember
what
happened
last
time
.
So
I
decided
to
warn
them
this
time
that
we
were
gonna
be
ambushed
and
that
my
friend
would
die
,
so
then
we
prepare
for
it
and
the
thing
happens
again
like
Deja
vu
.
This
time
tho
,
no
one
gets
hurt
,
and
then
we
all
celebrate
.
But
somehow
someway
i
got
shot
and
it
shocked
me
and
then
i
woke
up
and
i
actually
had
a
sharp
pain
in
my
stomach
for
a
very
brief
moment
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Anyways
,
that
was
it
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Um
,
your
stomach
doesn
’
t
hurt
rn
though
right
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
You
okay
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
No
no
it
was
just
when
i
woke
up
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
For
like
3
seconds
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
And
then
it
faded
completely
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
That
’
s
so
weird
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
Dream
was
a
little
odd
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Yeah
idk
it
always
ends
with
me
being
shot
😂
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
Both
of
those
were
insanely
vivid
in
memory
[sskarz]
[sskarz]
[prabipyakurel]
Where
did
you
get
shot
?
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Guessing

stomach

today
dw
[prabipyakurel]
[prabipyakurel]
[sskarz]
Well
I
went
to
my
English
class
,
then
from
there
had
lunch
and
worked
on
some
homework
,
then
went
to
my
next
2
classes
and
then
came
home
.
I
got
super
motivated
so
I
decided
to
basically
redo
everything
and
get
everything
in
life
in
order
,
so
I
redid
my
entire
resume
and
worked
on
fleshing
out
my
LinkedIn
(
since
I
got
hacked
and
someone
deleted
all
of
my
history
stuff
),
